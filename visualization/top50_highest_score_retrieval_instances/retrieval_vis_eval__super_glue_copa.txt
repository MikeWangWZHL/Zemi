Ten pin bowling is the most fashionable form of bowling. In ten pin bowling, matches consist of each player bowling a game. Each game is divided into ten frames. A frame allows a bowler 2 chances to bang down all 10 pins. The number of pins knocked over in each frame is recorded, a running total is made beneath the specific frame score as each frame goes on, and the player with the highest score in his/her game wins the match. Scores can be greater than the actual number of pins knocked over if strikes or spares are bowled. A strike is scored when a player knocks down all pins on the first roll in the frame. Rather than a score of just 10 for the frame, the player's score will be 10 plus the total pins knocked down on the next two rolls in the next frame(s). A spare is scored when all pins are knocked down using the second roll in the frame. The player's score for that frame will be 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the first roll in the next frame. A player who rolls a spare or strike in the last frame is given one (if it was a spare in the previous frame) or two more rolls (if it was a strike in the previous frame) to score additional points.
As standard in most sports there are colloquialisms for various occurences in a game. Two consecutive strikes is acknowledged

Retrieved Text: Pool, also known as pocket billiards, is played on a retangular table with six pockets into which balls are driven (shot). There are fifteen colored balls, numbered one to fifteen, and a white cue ball. The cue ball is driven with the cue stick against one or more of the other balls knocking them into the pockets for a score. If the cue ball falls into the pocket, the player loses his turn and is penalized.
Bowling refers to a series of sports or leisure activities in which a player rolls or throws a bowling ball. In indoor bowling, the target is usually to knock over pins. In outdoor variations, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a target ball as possible.
In pool a player says where he or she is going to hit the ball.
She called the shot. I am going to put the eight ball in the corner pocket.
I am going to call the shots on this deal.

For this very reason outside of the New England area Candlepins will be a difficult sell. Your job will be to educate your customer base about the game of Candlepins and how difficult it really is.
The highest sanctioned game in Candlepin Bowling is a 245. In Candlepin Bowling a high average for a male bowler would be about 130 for a women 120.
The game of Candlepins consist of ten frames (boxes) in which three balls are rolled unless a strike or spare is scored. Scoring can be done both vertically or horizontally. Scores are normally entered after three balls except in the case of strikes or spares.
In Candlepins the pins that have been knocked over remain on the playing field until the frame is over. Any fallen pin in the playing area may be used to assist you in knocking down the remaining pins. Pins that are in the gutter or out of play may not be used.
If all the pins are felled by the first ball it is a strike and is marked with a double line / /.
If all the pins are felled by the first two balls it is a spare and is marked with a single line /.
If all the pins are felled by three balls it is a ten box and marked by an X.

While bowling at Phillip’s Lanes, Knopp pulled off a trick shot nobody saw coming. He first released one bowling ball, which rolled along slow as can be, hugging the left gutter closely. Then, all of a sudden, he released a second ball, sending it down the lane at a much quicker pace.
The second ball beat the first ball to the bowling pins and knocked down all but one. Even if the stunt had ended there, Knopp would have been left with a possible spare. Not bad!
But then the first ball finally made its way down the lane and took out the remaining pin.
The end results sent Knopp running around and cheering. For good reason!
As you can imagine, this took quite a bit of time to master. But Knopp was willing to put the practice in to nail this shot.

I wanted his bowling ball. Dad loved bowling and was on a weekly league for as long as I can remember.
So, last night, I carefully took the snazzy, silver ball out of its very old, leather bag. The zipper hadn’t been unzipped in a long, long time. I felt like I was exposing a tomb.
When I stood at the head of the long lane, holding Dad’s ball, one thought raced through my head.
“Dad had a smaller thumb than me,” I said to myself as I realized that my right thumb was a little snug in its hole. I hadn’t considered that potential problem. Perhaps I was a little caught up in the sentimental emotion.
But I let it roll.
And knocked seven pins down with ball one.
When Dad’s silver ball popped back up on the conveyor belt, I grabbed it and started back for roll number two. As I placed my three fingers in their holes, I noticed something funny in the thumb hole. It felt rough.

Bowling in Cambridge + Little Extra which will be towards the end of the video!
Ten-pin bowling is a sport in which a "bowler" rolls a bowling ball down a wood-structure or synthetic (polyurethane) lane and towards ten pins positioned at the end of the lane. The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible. Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball, and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages. The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine. While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries, the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world.
In Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, the game is commonly referred to as just "Bowling". In New England, "bowling" is usually referred to as "regular bowling", "ten-pin bowling" or "big-ball bowling", because of the smaller diameter, lighter weight ball used in the Worcester, Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880, and the similarly "small-ball" sport of duckpin bowling (conceived of by 1895), popular in the Northeast United States, as well as Canada's own sport of five-pin bowling, all three of which use smaller diameter, lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling, without the necessity for finger holes in them.

As new laws are created and others repealed and rewritten, it is important to ensure that these changes strengthen rather than compromise our constitutional rights. During each session, and throughout the year, the ACLU of Utah addresses a wide range of issues, and our organizing and lobbying efforts are aimed at educating lawmakers and the public about the civil liberties implications of the proposed bills.
The citizen lobbyist has existed nearly as long as democratic government itself. The term “lobbying” originates from the early practice of attempting to influence legislators in the lobby outside of the legislative chambers before a vote. The function of any lobbyist or lobbying campaign is basically the same: Advocate, Educate, and Participate. Contrary to popular perception, lobbying does not need to be complicated or expensive.
People are often hesitant to get involved in the political process for several reasons: they believe legislators only listen to high-powered lobbyists and big donors, they don’t think legislation will affect their lives directly, or they don’t understand how the process works. But the single most important factor in influencing how a legislator votes on a bill is constituent support. And since very few people take the time to contact their legislators, one visit, one phone call, or one letter from a constituent speaks volumes.
Without a doubt, the most important tactic for monitoring the legislature is to understand how it works. In Utah, the House holds 75 members, and

Whitman acknowledges that he helped craft an industry-backed bill that’s now gaining momentum in the Oregon Legislature. The bill, Senate Bill 1541, would weaken protections from the health impacts of industrial toxic air pollution that are in rules drafted by a Cleaner Air Oregon citizen advisory committee, particularly for emissions from existing factories. For new industrial facilities, both approaches are the same.
SB 1541’s chief sponsor is Sen. Fred Girod, a Republican from Stayton.
The industry-backed bill, and another air toxics bill backed by proponents of Cleaner Air Oregon, SB 1508, were being marked up in legislative work sessions at the Capitol on Wednesday. SB 1508 would fund the implementation of Cleaner Air Oregon through fees paid by polluters.
In a telephone interview Tuesday afternoon with Cascadia Times, Whitman confirmed that he met a group of legislators convened by Sen. Arnie Roblan, a Democrat from Coos Bay.

AUGUSTA — A legislative committee voted Monday in favor of a bill to make it a crime for lobbyists to lie to the Legislature after narrowing the bill to exclude the public – and themselves.
As originally written, the bill would have made it a misdemeanor for lobbyists, members of the public or state employees to purposely provide false testimony or to “purposely omit or conceal a material fact” during testimony to legislative committees. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, also sought on Monday to add language making it a crime for lawmakers to lie to their colleagues when testifying in committee.
Secretary of State Matt Dunlap and several members of the State and Local Government Committee – mostly Democrats – initially raised concerns Monday about the proposal’s enforceability and about discouraging the public from participating in the legislative process. But after meeting behind closed doors for party caucuses, Republican committee members proposed stripping out potential sanctions against members of the public or state employees and, instead, limiting the new crime of providing false testimony to paid lobbyists and lobbyist associates.
The new version also does not include Sirocki’s proposal to include lawmakers in the bill, and it eliminates language allowing committee chairmen to administer an oath to speakers.
The change was enough to change the votes of several Democrats on the committee, however, and the lobbyist-only language won committee endorsement on a 10-2 vote.

Lobbyists predicted last week that the House would reject an amended version of the bill that would earmark all of the new revenues--estimated at $1.4 billion over 11 years--for road construction.
Opposition to the bill, they said, centers on a general reluctance to raise taxes, rather than the House transportation committee's recent vote to give none of the new funds to schools, which would have received $62 million a year under the original plan.
Spokesmen for the Kansas nea, the only state education group that backed the sales-tax hike, said the union has not given up hope of securing more state school aid. Members of the National Education Association affiliate are scheduled to hold a rally at the Statehouse this week to press the governor and lawmakers to allocate a third of Kansas' $300-million budget surplus for education.
The proposal to raise the sales tax by one-half cent, to 4.5 cents, was drafted by Economic Lifelines, a co8alition of business and trade groups that has been pressing for a comprehensive highway program.
Judith C. Runnels, Economic Lifeline's executive director, said last week that her group approached the union to seek its endorsement for the plan because many of the coalition's members have a long-standing interest in education.

However, it did not pass because our legislature wasted too much time on highly contentious and controversial special interest bills such as SJR 39, which would have been detrimental to business and would have sanctioned discrimination. The root of our problems begins with the fact that lobbyist gifts run rampant in Jefferson City.
No effort has been made to rein in or regulate what amounts to legal bribes. Career politicians continue to use their position as an elected legislator merely as a stepping stone to a more lucrative career as a lobbyist the minute they end their term in Jefferson City.
This festers an environment that caters to special interests and is poisonous to good government. We can and must do better by banning lobbyist gifts and making it illegal for legislators to become paid lobbyists after their political careers are over.

The “Education Initiative” outlining how the 2 percent tax on companies making more than $1 million in gross revenues should more properly be called the “Margin Tax Initiative”, the association said in an email today. The $800 million a year in revenue estimated to be raised from the proposed tax is not directed specifically to public education, the NTA said.
The money would go to the state general fund instead.
But that is just the beginning of the litany of concerns identified by the NTA.
The concerns are coming forward just as a poll is showing support for the proposal by a nearly 2-to-1 margin among those voters queried. The results of the poll, conducted at the end of May, were reported today by Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston.
Carole Vilardo, president of the NTA, said the association will be reporting even more concerns as businesses begin to analyze the consequences of the tax should it become law. Its first briefing on the proposed tax was issued earlier this month.
The proposal sounds good to voters because it is a tax on business and not on their own pocketbooks, she said.
The taxation proposal is modeled on the Texas margin tax and relies also on Assembly Bill 582 of the 2011 session of the Nevada Legislature, which Vilardo said was never fully vetted by lawmakers.

Dave & Buster's, the popular arcade and sports bar chain, wants to open its first Iowa location.
But the company says an Iowa law that limits the prizes that can be redeemed at arcades is keeping it out of the Hawkeye State.
"In order for them and their business model to work, the Iowa law needs to be changed," said David Adelman, a lobbyist representing the Dallas-based chain in the Iowa legislature.
Iowa law currently limits "amusement concession" prizes to $100 or less. That law regulates places like Chuck E. Cheese and Dave & Buster's, where customers can redeem tickets or tokens for prizes.
But Dave & Buster's stores offer some prizes like iPads or gaming consoles that far surpass that $100 limit. A new bill making its way through the legislature would lift the limit to $950. If it's approved, Adelman said it will effectively ensure "multiple" locations open up in Iowa in the coming months.
Attorneys for Dave & Buster's uncovered the provision after exploring several Iowa sites interested in hosting a new store.

Oregon voters will decide this November whether to make it more difficult for the state Legislature to raise taxes and fees.
To both supporters and opponents, it’s a battle over how power is wielded in the state Capitol.
But Gov. Kate Brown says Measure 104 — which would expand the kinds of revenue measures that require a three-fifths vote for approval — is really a power grab by interests upset with Democrats who run the state.
“They want to make things extremely difficult for the majorities down in Salem,” said Brown, arguing that Measure 104 raises the prospect of an extended gridlock over passing the state’s budget.
One thing is clear. Measure 104 is yet another chapter in Oregon’s long war over taxes. From initiatives limiting property taxes to the long search for a stable source of school funding, the issue of how to pay for government services has been a constant in much of the state’s history.
In a sense, the Measure 104 story starts in the mid-1990s when Republicans ran the state Legislature. They persuaded voters to approve a constitutional amendment requiring a three-fifths vote in the House and Senate to approve a tax increase.
For nearly two decades, that essentially meant that any bill that produced significant new tax revenues for the state had to meet the supermajority threshold. Bills needed 18 votes in the Senate and 36 in the House, instead of the normal majority of 16 and 31.

It would apply to state-regulated health plans for individuals and small groups. It would also create a state licensing process for ABA practitioners.

Home ›› Luggage Travel Tips ›› What happens to unclaimed luggage?
Most airlines define unclaimed luggage as bags that have been delayed, lost, stolen or damaged. In addition, there are items left on planes, which is quite common occurrence.
The airlines make every effort to trace the owners of lost luggage and vast majority of lost bags are reunited with their owners within few days. There are though always some unclaimed bags that cannot be returned, e.g. due to lost luggage tags or because not labeled in the first place.
So what happens to these bags? The airlines offer this lost luggage for sale after certain period (usually 3 months). Meaning you could find your bag in a lost luggage store or at a lost luggage auction.
How Many Bags Are Unclaimed Every Year?
According to the US Department of Transportation (DOT) airlines operating in the US mishandled 3.39 out of every 1,000 bags in 2011 (or 0.339%).
Worldwide it is generally estimated that between 0.5 - 1% of all check-in bags fail to meet up with their owners at their destinations. However, 80-90% of those mishandled bags are returned to their owners within 24 hours and 95-98% of them within 5 days.
Over half of the remaining bags are then reunited with their owners within the next 90 days, thanks to the comprehensive baggage tracing process conducted by all the main airlines.
This means that very small portion of mishandled bags ends up as permanently lost or unclaimed luggage. However, due to the share number of check-in bags worldwide

Question: Why do travelers carry-on bags?
Answer: Because airlines do a lousy job handling checked luggage.
In January, for example, the Transportation Department recorded 6.04 reports of "mishandled baggage" per 1,000 passengers. On a wide-body flight of about 300 passengers, that means almost two flyers have their checked bags lost or temporarily misdirected.

An estimated 30 million bags were temporarily lost by airlines in 2005, and 200,000 of those bags were never reunited with their owners, according to an industry report released on Monday.
The report by SITA Inc, a company providing technology solutions for the air transport industry, also noted that "the problem of mishandled baggage is worsening on both sides of the Atlantic."
The 30 million misdirected bags comprised only 1 per cent of the 3 billion bags processed last year by airports, up from 0.7 per cent in 2004, said SITA, which is promoting technology it says would reduce the problem.
Last year, mishandled luggage cost world airlines $2.5 billion, compared with $1.6 billion in 2004, SITA said. The jump partly reflects improvements in data collection, but also the increasing costs resulting from inadequate baggage management.
Greater airport congestion, tight connection times, increased transfers among airlines and stricter security are all contributing to more late or missing bags, said SITA, a Geneva-based company that is owned by the airlines, airports and other international air transport industry companies.
But the biggest problem is the growing number of passengers, whose additional bags cause delays and complicate handling, it said. "Growth is welcome but it has to be better managed if airlines and airports want to improve the passenger experience by eliminating delays from the system," said Francesco Violante, SITA's managing director.

The chance of your luggage getting lost or stolen isn’t high – less than one percent of travelers reported mishandled luggage, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 2009 Air Travel Consumer Report. Yet baggage-handling accidents and thefts do happen, which is why it’s important to have the proper insurance in place before your depart for your destination.
Fortunately, if you already have a homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy in place, you’re probably covered if your luggage is lost, stolen, or damaged during travel. Most homeowner’s (and renter’s) insurance policies cover any property you own anywhere in the world. While most policies offer protection for your belongings regardless of your location, you may need to purchase additional coverage in the form of a floater or endorsement to your policy if you’re taking valuables, such as jewelry, gifts, or sporting equipment, that may have limited coverage under your policy. If you’re unsure about your policy limits, your Trusted Choice® independent insurance agent can determine if you have the right coverage to protect your luggage and provide you with additional coverage options if needed.

The 2011 rate of mishandled bags represents the best performance by the airlines in that category since the Department of Transportation started collecting data about luggage in 1988, according to trade group Airlines for America. Last year, there were 3.39 reports of mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers, compared with 3.51 in 2010.
The rate of bumped passengers also reached a record low since the department started collecting data in 1995, A4A says. The rate of bumped passengers dropped to 0.81 per 10,000 passengers in 2011 versus 1.09 in 2010. The airline industry trade group is highlighting numbers released Tuesday in the Department of Transportation's Air Travel Consumer Report.
"Our members are committed to and are delivering levels of safety and customer service that no other industry, given its complexity, matches and the airlines are working to improve on that every day," said Nicholas Calio, A4A president and CEO, in a statement.
The number of consumer complaints against U.S. carriers held steady at 7,465 in 2011, although the rate of complaints per 100,000 passengers dropped slightly from 2010. Southwest Airlines had the lowest rate of complaints among U.S. airlines with just 0.32 complaints per 100,000 passengers. United Airlines had the highest number with 2.21 complaints per 100,000 passengers.

Time to baggage claim will be as measured by Delta's baggage tracking system, where available; lost, mishandled and damaged bags are excluded from the promotion, as are oversize, overweight baggage and special items.
It is believed that Delta initially started this as a short-term promotion to see how the system works and assess the need for any changes, with the hope being the airline can roll it out into a full-time promise.
Alaska Airlines has a similar guarantee and was the first major domestic airline to implement such a program full-time.

Frontier Airlines has agreed to pay a fine of $400,000 after the Department of Transportation found it denied seats to fliers before properly calling on volunteers to give them up. Frontier also failed to explain to those fliers that they were eligible for cash compensation, DOT concluded.
Frontier neither admitted to nor denied the charges. The airline said it would update its procedures and reporting systems, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The fines come in response to an investigation of 200 complaints about overbooked flights the carrier received in 2014 and 2015 at its Denver International Airport hub. The probe verified many of these claims, concluding there was “wide-spread practice of noncompliance,” especially in how it handled compensating volunteers who agreed to take another flight.
“During on-site airport inspections conducted in September 2016 by Enforcement Office staff, some Frontier agents, when asked about the handling of oversale situations, informed Enforcement Office staff that only vouchers, rather than cash or a check, are offered as involuntary denied boarding compensation,” DOT said in its consent decree.
And even when they were offered vouchers, it often took several weeks to receive them, which amounted to “an unfair and deceptive practice” in its application of DOT regulations.

The airline handles more than 30 million bags a year and the new technology, provided by global air transport technology specialist SITA, will be instrumental in reducing the number of mishandled bags and quickly resolving baggage issues.
As part of the six-year deal, LATAM Airlines Group will roll out 350 handheld devices to its baggage team to facilitate the loading, tracking, tracing, reconciliation and management of baggage across airports in seven countries. SITA’s technology is able to put the same baggage data at the fingertips of every ground handling employee at all airports in real-time, making it possible to track baggage no matter where is it along its journey.
While SITA BagManager cannot prevent air traffic, weather or technical issues, which can cause bags to be mishandled or delayed, it can reduce the mishandling of bags, improving the experience for many travelers. In 2014, mishandled bags cost the global air transport industry a total of US$2.4bn; in addition to these costs mishandled bags also have a high impact on customer satisfaction, affecting an airline's and airport’s brand.

There are so many airline guidelines to follow and features to decide on that you may hesitate to buy because you’re afraid you’ll pick the wrong thing.

Size. One of the most important things I look for in carry-on luggage is the size of the luggage. Many airlines say that your carry-on must be less than 45” if the height, width, and depth are added together, but the luggage also needs to be no bigger than 22x14x9. If you find a bag with 22x9x14 or less dimensions then you should be set. Airfarewatchdog has a great list of airline carry-on bag policies if you want more specific airline information.
Another thing I look for is the weight of the luggage. My bag, which is the Victorinox Luggage Werks Traveler 4.0 Wt 20 Bag, weighs about 7 pounds. The light weight along with dimensions (15 x 20.1 x 9.1 inches) falling within airline guidelines make this bag a great choice.

October 1999, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. It was a normal day at the hotel, and in typical fashion, the human resources office was welcoming new job applicants and assisting them to fill out the employment forms. In the office, several tables and chairs were set up to allow the job candidates space to fill in their applications. And on that particular day, the competition for jobs took a serious turn for the worse.
At approximately 11am, a woman walked in to the human resources office with her 4-year old son, as she apparently could not find a babysitter to look after him on that day. She inquired about vacancies in the housekeeping department, and proceeded to sit and fill out an application. A few minutes later, another woman entered the office and applied for the same position. They sat at the same table, across from one another, quietly filling out the forms.
It seems that the number of open positions was quite small, and the two women soon began a conversation about which one of them was going to get the job, as the 4-year old boy stood by waiting patiently. And in a matter of minutes, their discussion evolved into a heated argument, both ladies eager to explain to the other why they were more qualified. Name calling and shouting soon followed.
And that’s when it happened. The first woman, with her 4-year old-son watching carefully, reached into

Mind, Body, Spirit consists of three pictures. The artwork representative of "Mind" shows a woman in a wheelchair wearing a red beret, bright yellow smock, and holding a paintbrush in one hand and a palette in the other. The frame around the seated woman is composed of ovals of one color enclosed in squares of the opposite hue. The woman looks directly at the viewer and sits squarely in the center of her chair and the image. Although enclosed by a thick border, the woman’s feet, and the brushes in her right hand and mouth break out past her boundary.
The depiction of "Body" maintains the same layout template. Here, however, the woman seated in a wheelchair is wearing yellow flippers, a yellow bathing cap on top of which sit goggles, and a red swim outfit. On her lap is a floatation device - a swimming tube - that the woman covers with her folded arms. Four colors comprise the background: blue, green, aquamarine, and purple; these are grouped into shapes evocative of waves in water. As in "Body," the seated figure, although enclosed by thick borders, trespasses beyond; in this picture, her flipper-encased feet challenge the confines of her space.
"Spirit" makes use again of the same template. Here, the background is given perspective and is representational of grass and sky. The blue-green colors are restrained and soothing. The woman meditates in a wheelchair, and is visually balanced with symmetrical positioning of hands, arms, and feet.

Police arrested a 26-year-old Ocala man for allegedly dragging and choking a woman on Wednesday and for a separate alleged incident three weeks ago.
The 21-year-old victim first told officers she did not want to get Corey Huffman in trouble. She later said they were arguing and she tried to leave the residence. She said she went to the front porch and Huffman followed her, grabbed her and pulled her inside, placed one hand over her mouth and used the other hand to choke her, according to the Ocala Police Department report.
The woman told the officers that three weeks ago Huffman put a 20-gauge shotgun under her chin and ordered her to shut up. She said she did not call 911 because she is afraid of him, the report states.
Huffman told officers he and the woman argued and said he did pull her inside, but grabbed her shoulder so she would stop screaming. He said he accidentally put his hand around her neck. He denied the incident involving the gun.
Officers found a shotgun and took it. Huffman was arrested for domestic battery by strangulation and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He remained at the Marion County Jail on Thursday, with no bail.
Police said that since children were at the northeast residence at the time of both incidents, the Department of Children and Families was notified.

The left hand reaches around to her backside to secure a second small child who clutches her shoulders with both hands. The mother, with ‘coffee bean’ eyes and mouth, well-modeled nose, incised appliquéd headgear, earring, and tresses of hair falling to her breasts, is wearing a tiered skirt decorated with an incised sash and pigmented with remains of black and reddish brown on buff; the child on her back, with well defined eyes and hair, has remains of white pigment upon the face.
Conjoined ‘flat figures’ are very uncommon. A woman carrying two children is quite rare. These general maternity types are often thought of by some scholars as fertility symbols in shamanistic rituals for women wishing children, particularly ones with several children.

In April this year, a drunk Tatt went to the woman's home near Toowoomba.
He "violently banged” on her front door and she refused to let him in, Justice Peter Flanagan said on Thursday.
Then he lifted up the garage door and went around to the back door.
"Finally he seemed to calm down and the victim let him in,” Justice Flanagan added.
Then he got angry, swore at the woman, and she asked him to leave.
Justice Flanagan said Tatt grabbed the woman round the throat with his left hand and put his right hand round her nose and mouth.
Struggling to breathe, she bit his hand and he let go.
Tatt then "grabbed the victim around the throat again and squeezed,” the judge said.
Justice Flanagan said a court previously heard choking was a recognised warning sign of future "domestic violence or even homicide”.
Tatt was accused of choking the woman when he was on bail and awaiting trial for other offences that he later pleaded guilty to.
While incarcerated in May, Tatt sent letters to the woman, landing himself in further trouble.
Justice Flanagan said "an unacceptable risk of re-offending” existed with Tatt.

After Roberts forced his way in, he began to argue with the woman, who is 6 weeks pregnant, and grabbed hold of the purse she had across her left shoulder and ripped it off of her, causing a bruise on her arm, according to the criminal complaint against Roberts.
Roberts began to choke the woman by putting one hand on her throat and his other hand across her mouth and nose, causing her to have a difficult time breathing, the criminal complaint says.
The woman attempted to defend herself by hitting Roberts, but this only enraged him more and he struck her in the face,according to the police report. However, the woman did manage to break free from his grasp.
Roberts then began breaking items in the woman's residence before the woman bit him in the arm in an attempt to make him stop. Roberts bit her on the back of the shoulder in response.

A parent-report measure, the Temper Tantrum Grid, was used to measure the frequency of common tantrum behaviours. Laboratory and parent report measures of emotional reactivity and emotional competence were administered. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the proposal that anger and distress are separate but overlapping tantrum processes. Correlation analyses showed that temper tantrum anger and distress were related to emotional reactivity and emotional competence. There was no evidence to support the notion that emotional competence moderated the effect of emotional reactivity on temper tantrums. In contrast, emotional competence was a significant mediator of the association between emotional reactivity and temper tantrums. Overall, the results support the anger-distress model of temper tantrums. The findings suggest that children’s temper tantrums are systematically related to the overall organization of emotion and behaviour in preschool children.

Retrieved Text: Temper tantrums can put your parenting skills to the test. The 3-year old that explodes with impatience or the 6-year old who screams in the toy store after hearing ‘no’ are all displays of a temper tantrum. The kicking, stomping, pounding, yelling, crying, slamming doors, throwing the body on the floor, and hurtful words that accompany a temper tantrum are typical of children between the ages of three and six with some seven- to nine-year olds still exhibiting the behavior. This emotional outburst can take place at any time and any place, whether the child is in a doctor’s office, grocery store, around family and friends, and even at church.
In order to gain a better hold of a situation that involves a temper tantrum, it is suggested to learn more about the subject and its causes. The emotions that swell within a child to create a temper tantrum involve higher brain functions that are unable to lower the levels of excited expression associated with the lower brain functions that control emotional and physical responses. As a result, an unreasonable fit that may include screaming, crying, and intense defiance will often surface. The child may become completely unwilling to listen to or comply with any efforts to pacify the situation.
Often, a child cannot stay still, sit down, or stand in one place. Sometimes, even when the reason for the temper tantrum is settled (as seen with the parent that finally gives in to buying the candy bar), the child may not even reach a level of calm

There was so much information and growth that we decided to extend it for a five week workshop based on the Five Steps to Temper Tantrum Success. The Five Steps is a method of how to handle your child's tantrum in the moment it's happening. The steps are based on how our play therapist, Kellie, works through tantrums with children in session.
Although most believe that tantrums only happen to children, these steps work for kids of all ages! One of the things we discussed at our workshop was that a 'temper tantrum' is most times a result of a need not being met. Regardless of age, there may be times your child has a need that is not being met and the result is an emotional outburst or 'temper tantrum'.
The amazing thing is that these steps truly work. Giving your child space to have their emotions while also placing healthy boundaries on them is one of the most loving things parents can do. Having the whole range of human emotions is so natural. Allowing your child to have that is so beneficial for their growth.
Step #1 Stay Calm: When anger meets anger, there is an explosion. When children are having a temper tantrum, they are experiencing an emotional war inside. By staying calm, you set the tone for the tantrum.
Step#2 Validate Feelings: In the midst of an emotional meltdown, validating your child's feelings allows them to feel seen. It reminds them that they are

In the January 2008 issue of The Journal of Pediatrics, researchers compared the temper tantrums of children who had been diagnosed with depression and disruptive behavior disorders to children without disorders. It was found that children with mental health diagnoses had more aggressive tantrums and had tantrums that lasted for a longer period of time. Children with depression were more likely to have self-injurious behavior during tantrums.
When most children have tantrums, if the parent walks away or ignores the behavior, the tantrum stops fairly quickly. However, other children continue to have a tantrum, even to the point where it lasts more than one hour. It is very difficult for these children to soothe themselves. If your child has temper tantrums that last for an extended period of time or if there is any self-injurious behavior that occurs, seek professional help.

During a temper tantrum, your child may run around screaming and yelling, bang their head, pound their fists, kick and bite, cry and roll around on the floor. Your child may also hold their breath. Don’t worry if this happens, children will naturally breathe when they need to.

Loud mouths aren't the only thing the parrot species are known for, they're also highly intelligent animals who love to talk. The ones that spend time around people often pick up human words and will repeat the ones they hear the most often. That's not always a good thing because Cockatoos are also screamers, when they talk it's like they’re yelling. If they pick up a naughty word, like a curse, expect to hear it often!
The outspoken bird in this clip named Pebbles is a case in point. Be forewarned, she curses like a sailor and has a lot of impolite things to say. According to her caretakers at the Saskatoon Parrot Rescue up in Canada, before they took her in she had lived in approximately 10 homes over the last 20 years or so. Somewhere along the way she learned how to swear and the rest as they say, is history.
Pebbles had been enjoying the day outside of her cage and clearly didn't want it to end. When she was asked to get back inside of it, she threw a temper tantrum and had a major freak out! The beautiful white feathered girl acted like a diva as she flapped around and stomped back and forth on top of her cage.

Quinn Duane was supposed to be celebrating her wedding nuptials this past weekend. That all changed when she called her mom Kari to let her know that her boyfriend of four years got cold feet and called off the wedding.
The wedding reception had already been paid, so Quinn and Kari decided to host a three-course meal for the homeless. The new guests dined on salads, gnocchi, salmon, and steak at Sacramento’s four-star Citizen Hotel.
The 27-year-old stayed home with friends while her parents hosted the event. Quinn’s non-refundable honeymoon to Belize will be enjoyed by her and her mom.

“He had a bride who called him up a few days before her wedding and told him she couldn't go through with the wedding because she was in love with someone else,” she explained and then re-wrote their conversation.

It is normal for both brides and grooms to get cold feet—a feeling of anxiety about the upcoming wedding. Caught up in the tempest of wedding preparations, you may start feeling nervous and uncertain about the event. This is a natural feeling and usually passes away quickly.
However, sometimes cold feet indicate that you may be worried about something seriously wrong in the relationship: your fiancÃ©’s negative behavior, violence, deceit, difference of opinion over major issues etc. Don’t continue with such a wedding just because you’re afraid to cancel it.
Most of the time, getting cold feet is very common before a wedding. The stress of planning the event can often lead to little fears and anxieties.
A wedding is a happy occasion, so avoid getting too stressed about it. Take a break occasionally from wedding activities and spend some time doing yoga or running. Hang out with your friends and family, watch a movie or play games.
Sharing problems often lightens one’s burdens. Speak to a close friend or family member about your fears. Talk to a married person who may be able to share his or her own experience of pre-wedding nerves.
Speaking to your beloved is also a good option. You may find that he or she is going through the same thing. Don’t be afraid of hurting or angering them. Understanding and sharing are an important part of a happy

Wedding is an elaborate affair in India, comprising of a large number of rituals, customs and traditions. One of the important rituals, especially in context of the bride, comprises of 'Mehndi' (commonly known as henna). As a part of this ritual, the powder of henna leaves is mixed with water (and many-a-times, oil and lemon juice as well), to form a paste. This paste is then applied on the hands as well as the feet of the bride, in the form of intricate patterns. The henna is removed only after the design dries off completely.

Foot washing was not so much a celebration as ceremonial. The night before her wedding the bride’s feet were washed by an older, married woman, often a relative, and symbolised good luck. Could its origins lie in the Bible story of Mary washing Christ’s feet with her tears?

Then, when it's time to receive the ring and slip it on the brides finger, you might want to think about coating your fingers with an adhesive spray if you think you'll be extra

Luckily for us (and for our wedding boards on Pinterest!), this beautiful Bride wanted more. Beautiful lace, romantic draping and delicate beading is only the beginning of what makes this gown such a stunner. The real magic is the detachable train cascading ruffles, giving the lovely Bride two dresses in one. Take a look through the gallery to see the gown in all it’s beautiful glory, and all the details that make this wedding so dreamy.
From The Bride…I am originally from the Northeast and recently my husband and I relocated to his home state of sunny Florida 9 months before our wedding. Since he had proposed on the beach near our new home and we knew we would stay in Florida for years to come we chose to host a destination wedding with our closest family and friends. We had a weekend long celebration, a cozy dinner with the wedding party the Thursday prior, a welcome cocktail event for all guests in downtown Fernandina Beach the night before the wedding and then the big day at a private yacht club overlooking the Intercoastal. We kept our guest list small, only 79 people attended our laid back absolutely beautiful day.We wrote our own vows in which we read to each other causing ourselves and our guests to both laugh and cry. I made a ton of decor on my own via Pinterest spending many nights and weekend

In the beginning, I loved helping the bride in any way I could, and I especially loved feeling valued enough to be asked to be involved in such a special day. The first three times brides popped the question to me, I excitedly said, “Yes, yes! A thousand times, yes!” while giddily hopping around. Back then, being asked to be a bridesmaid meant that I got to be up close to the magic of weddings and that the bride cared for and trusted me.
As a result, the effort I threw into those first three weddings was probably the most selfless work I have ever done. It was all about doing whatever I could to make things easier for the bride and groom. I would block out all of my weekends to run errands with the bride.
Most of the brides were very hands-on and Pinterest-obsessed, so we would spend weekend after weekend visiting every corner of Seattle to find the best possible deals without sacrificing the “dream wedding.” This meant that the bridesmaids became mini wedding planners. We would take a weekend to haggle at Pike Place with the flower vendors for our bouquets and boutonnieres. The following weekend, we would travel all over the many districts within Seattle looking for the perfect venue. My favorite weekend was the dress one; we’d city hop, visiting

My understanding is that once opened…..there is no way to “keep the fizz in” unless you re-pressurize the carbonated liquid with carbon-dioxide. Even those pump gadgets will not work because it is pumping in an air mixture containing 21% oxygen.
Jimmy, I wouldn’t think these would be suitable for anything other than keeping your drink covered while you finish it. It might slow down the loss of carbonation, but it’s not going to keep the contents bubbly for days after opening. Each time you remove the lid, a bit more of the carbonation gases will be escaping, so you probably shouldn’t take all day to drink it.
It’s less a matter of “keeping the fizz in” and more a matter of “slowing the loss of fizz”. A good, sealed cap will slow the loss. The pressurized caps will slow the loss more.

CapaBubbles® is a reusable silicone cap that reseals a bottle of sparkling wine once it is opened. An adaptation of the original CapaBunga®, it transforms a bottle of sparkling wine into a screw cap bottle. The cap has a threaded insert that once unscrewed from the base clips under the flange of the sparkling wine bottle, the cap is then twisted down on top of this piece preserving the bubbles in your Champagne or Sparkling wine for up to one week.
It is simple to use with the added bonus that the low profile means it can easily fit in a fridge door and a user can control the amount of effervescence unlike a traditional bouchon stopper where gas escapes abruptly. The video below also shows clearly how CapaBubbles works.

It is even more dangerous when the bottle is kept with leftover sports drink mix. The longer you keep them untouched, the greater the danger they pose to your health. It is essential that you keep them fresh and clean more often than you think you should so you can enjoy your water bottle for more years of use.
Here are some helpful tips you need to consider to keep the grime and the germs off your water holder and the liquids that you drink while on the go.
Wash them after every use. Just as you would want your drinking cup or glass thoroughly cleaned before and after using them, you would never want to drink from a water bottle that you have missed to clean. You can’t be sure what you leave on its lid every time you open the bottle as you ride and drink. If you don’t have soap and water at the moment, even just rinsing the bottle will do.
Wash the bottle with your hands. The easiest way to clean your water bottle is to use your hands to rinse or wash it with soap and water.
Use a bottle brush. It is easier to clean hard to reach parts of the bottle with a long-handled bottle brush. This can remove the sticky residue better and easier than just rinsing the water.

The name of the syndrome is derived from a botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. In August 1973 four employees of Sveriges Kreditbank were held hostage in the bank’s vault for six days. During the standoff, a seemingly incongruous bond developed between captive and captor. One hostage, during a telephone call with Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, stated that she fully trusted her captors but feared that she would die in a police assault on the building.
The most infamous example of Stockholm syndrome may be that involving kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst. In 1974, some 10 weeks after being taken hostage by the Symbionese Liberation Army, Hearst helped her kidnappers rob a California bank. But it was during the hostage crisis in Iran (1979–81) that the Stockholm syndrome worked its way into the public imagination. The syndrome was also cited after the 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847. Although passengers underwent a hostage ordeal that stretched more than two weeks, upon their release some were openly sympathetic to the demands of their kidnappers. Terry Anderson (1985–91), Terry Waite (1987–91), and Thomas Sutherland (1985–91), all of whom had been kidnaped by Islamist militants in Lebanon, claimed that they had been treated well by their captors, despite the fact that they had often been held in solitary confinement and chained up in small, unclean cells.

A group of 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides taken hostage on Monday were taken by their kidnappers in three four-wheel drive vehicles from northwest Sudan’s Oweinat Mountain region 10 miles over the border into Libyan territory on Thursday. They are still on the move, according to reports compiled by the Christian Science Monitor.
The Libyan government did not comment right away on the developments in the case, however, and Egypt has informed the Associated Press that it had no data on the hostages being taken over the Libyan border.
The apparent abduction took place on Monday near Egypt’s Gilf al-Kebir plateau, located near the country’s borders with Sudan and Libya. The plateau is famous for its cave drawings.

Conducting relations with “rogue states,” namely sovereign states who disregard human rights or other international norms, for example, raises the concern that we are helping to legitimize governments and practices we otherwise strongly condemn. Nonetheless, as some have argued, there may be an obligation to negotiate with such a state when it comes to grave security issues like weapons of mass destruction. How do the alternatives to negotiation impact the moral considerations involved in dealing with such states?
Like “rogue states,” non-state armed groups come in different forms, from political insurgencies to criminal organizations to millenarian groups. Often these actors are designated collectively as “terrorists,” a term for which there is no academic consensus—and which, it has been argued, hinders prospects for negotiation and fosters entrenched violence. Does negotiating with non-state actors, through official state channels or otherwise, undermine the international order by conferring a legitimacy and authority traditionally granted only to states? Or does legitimacy in some cases attain to non-Westphalian groups? How should states balance the risks of attributing legitimacy to unsavory actors against the possibility of escalated violence stemming from a refusal to negotiate?
When confronted with non-state hostage takers, many governments insist that they will not negotiate, but in practice exceptions abound.

"It is not good for the mall business," Schostak said. "If this company wants to grow again - and it does give them some new vehicles for growth - it will give them incredible clout with the developer."
The merger, which is expected to close during the third quarter, would give Federated a presence in Southeast Michigan for the first time through the ownership of 11 Marshall Field's stores and three Lord & Taylor stores now owned by May.
Federated owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's and has been converting most of its regional chains to the Macy's name. It has said it is likely to do the same for many of May's department stores.

The tentative project joins a chorus of other retail developments around the U.S. and beyond aiming to expand Apple Store capacity.

Plans show that Apple intends to replace Cherry Hill’s existing The North Face location adjacent to Macy’s and California Pizza Kitchen with a roughly 10,000 square foot store.
Apple’s circa-2008 store inside the Cherry Hill Mall is sealed off from the outdoors and natural lighting. The new space would offer both an indoor entrance and a 2,000 square foot outdoor plaza with seating and trees. A similar layout concept merging traditional shopping center access with a more significant exterior courtyard and facade was used in Indianapolis at The Fashion Mall at Keystone in 2016.

How fitting then, that helicopters were the transportation of choice for Precision-Aire, when we strategized on how to replace the older HVAC units that supplied the public areas of the mall.
Transporting the equipment by air solved a number of problems. It saved time because the extra large units didn’t have to be transported via ground in pieces and re-assembled on site. And air transport avoided the piping and other obstacles on the roof top that would normally prevent rolling the units into place. But using helicopters had it’s own challenge. Precision had to coordinate with the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), local municipalities and police and a section of the mall had to be evacuated during installation. Once the equipment was on the roof, Precision coordinated plumbing, electrical, steelwork and the start-up of the equipment.

Adjacent to the main shopping centre is a marina called The Waterfront accommodating a number of bars, restaurants and the studios of Black Country Radio.

In the 1980s, the UK Government created a number of enterprise zones which gave incentives to firms wishing to set up business in areas which had been affected by a downturn in the manufacturing industry. The Brierley Hill area had suffered the loss of the Round Oak Steelworks, and it was hoped that other manufacturers could be encouraged to move into the area.

Very disturbed by this, I contacted the RE/Max workplace soon after studying that this agent was of course a broker in colorado (as licensing demands), but not at all the managing broker. I hated cold calling, and even worse, I hated walking about my neighborhood, beating on doors, and soliciting Century 21’s real estate services.

If the seller has retained a real estate agent to sell his property, the seller has previously signed a listing agreement with the agent’s firm. These are all problems that the seasoned agent knows that even the most savvy buyer might not think of. A real estate agent is a licensed particular person who functions as an intermediary amongst sellers and purchasers of real estate. I was successful in undertaking this, and a couple of months later Harry bought a house in Hawaii by means of a Century 21 agent.

The world we live in today is a digital one and searching for a home is no different. Buyers now have apps that let them search by location and neighborhoods. Online listings have virtual tours so viewers can look at a bunch of potential homes while narrowing down their search to a select few in the effort to save time. Online searching maximizes the ability to compare and contrast homes on the market by selected features. Most of this is done before a potential home buyer connects with a real estate agent.
Also in 1964, 61 percent of home buyers contacted agents they knew. In 2014, buyers worked with an agent 87 percent of the time to find their home, so trust in a REALTOR® is still king. While the initial process may start online, home buyers turn to the advice from a trusted real estate agent. The difference is that home buyers are entering the process more educated about the market before they speak to a home seller or an agent.

Assumptions may be helpful as you embark on a research project, but in a sales transaction, not so much. Assumptions will ultimately be proved or disproved by your research or study results, but are highly likely to increase your level of risk in a sales transaction. Confusing the two by mistake, or due to time constraints or poor business practices, is ill-advised.
Here’s a real-world scenario that demonstrates how easily a situation can slide from assumption to “fact” in a blink of an eye.
A real estate agent has obtained a listing from an estate of a recently deceased elderly woman. The heirs, her grandchildren, never lived in the home. They planned to sell the property through the agent but were uncertain whether the property was on the municipal sewer system or not. The agent had recently sold a property nearby and was aware that the area had sewers installed approximately 20 years ago.
The agent allowed the selling estate to list the property with municipal sewer even though no one had verified to be certain. An assumption was made based on the sewer service in the neighborhood and no visible evidence of a private septic system on the property.
A young couple with two children purchased the home and after several months the septic system on the property failed as it was being used more heavily than it had been over the past 20 years when the elderly woman was living there alone. A lawsuit was brought against the sellers

The first thing to do is read the bios of any real estate agents you’re considering. Bios tell a lot about an agent, including what certifications they hold and how long they’ve been an agent. Some bios even have some personal information such as charitable interests or a little about their family life. Look for signs that the agent’s interests and certifications align with your needs.
A lot of real estate agents specialize in a certain area such as short sales or helping first-time homebuyers. If your situation falls into a particular category, you could look for a real estate agent who caters to your particular needs. This can simplify the experience, since the real estate agent will have some expertise in navigating the details of the transaction. Look for relevant experience in their bio, or ask them personally.
You’ll likely be working with your real estate agent for a long time. The relationship between you and your agent should be pleasant. Not only should you have a good rapport with your agent, but you should be able to feel like they understand the human aspect of what you’re trying to achieve with your home buying or selling.

How much communication is normal between owner and agent before, during and after selling?
Make your expectations clear from the start and talk to your agent about setting a communication strategy that matches your personal preferences.
Successful real estate agents are expert communicators. The property business is focused on people, and building relationships – with vendors and buyers – requires top-level communication skills. That’s why most real estate agents will be experienced communicators and place a priority on keeping you informed throughout the selling process.
However, what qualifies as a ‘normal’ amount of communication between owner and agent differs between vendors. For example, one vendor may expect daily phone calls, while another may prefer a concise weekly email update.
How and when do you want to be contacted? For example, taking phone calls during business hours may be off limits at your workplace, so your agent will need to know to call you after hours or limit daytime communications to emails and text messages. Be clear about your preferences with your agent from the beginning of your relationship to limit frustrations.
Frequency of communicationHow often do you expect to be contacted? Some vendors like daily updates, while others find that level of communication too intrusive. Talk to your agent and set our clear procedures that suit your preferences.

So no matter how upset you may feel about the election process or the candidates, you can reframe that. To do so, ask yourself one or more of these questions.
- Does getting upset/angry serve me? - Does my being upset/angry bring me more or less joy into my life - What can I learn from my being upset/anger?

I was in junior high school and had just sat down at the kitchen table one evening to finish my homework. The house was quiet, except for the sound of the TV in the next room, and I was alone in the kitchen.
So, in a panic, I jumped up from my chair, checked to see if the coast was clear, quickly dropped my pants and saw one of those little black, fuzzy spiders fall into my whitie tidies and crawl away! When I had pulled up my pants and regained my composure, I allowed that if I had been the spider, I would have bailed out too!

His father and grandfather before him were farmers in the rich farmland of the Mississippi Delta. With a legacy bestowed by their Scottish immigrant ancestors, they had strong work ethics, Christian values and believed in the strength of family.
I never heard my Daddy raise his voice in anger or utter a curse word in my entire life. He was a strong but gentle man. As the father of four daughters, he was mellow and laid-back – I suppose he had to be. With a quick and ready smile, he had a good sense of humor. As children, my niece Sharon and I would get to laughing at the supper table and could easily get him to laugh. On more than a few occasions, we were sent from the table until we regained our composure.
He and Mama spent a lifetime together. After a severe stroke claimed her speech and altered her personality, he was kind and patient with her. In the last few months of his life, one of his favorite country songs that he would listen to often was “I’ll Go to My Grave Loving You” by the Statler Brothers.

Some of the players, including my son, played hard until the final whistle blew. Others, however, gave up the game when the other team began to dominate. Some even demonstrated a downright negative attitude, fouling out of frustration.
It was interesting to see this mixture of distinct attitudes among the players in response to their situation, in part because I witness the same attitudes among job seekers facing tough searches.
These people are a pleasure to assist. They wear a smile on their face, despite how they’re feeling inside. Even when they don’t hear back from an employer after spending hours on an application — even when they make it through three rounds of interviews only to lose to someone who is a “better fit” — they trudge on.
When he finally landed a job, I asked him how he had felt during his search. Not surprisingly, he told me there were times when he felt despair and wondered if he would ever get a gig. And yet, he never gave up.
He is so grateful for the services I and others offered him at the career center that he speaks to our networking group regularly. He also lets us know when there are openings at the company for which he works.
It shows on their face. They say they’ll never land a position. They lose sight of the bigger picture. Like my son’s teammates, they walk through their job search rather than run.

#1: As is the case with so many issues in parenting, we do well to begin with a gut check. “How am I doing with managing my own anger?” While hypocrisy is an upgrade over disengagement, our credibility is enhanced when we walk our talk. Moreover, if I’m losing it with some regularity, I could be significantly contributing to my child’s problem with anger control.
#2: Also like so many issues in parenting, proactive strategies usually work better than reactive ones. We all lose IQ points when we’re angry (i.e., the more primitive parts of the brain take over), so if I wait until my kid has lost it to do my interventions, my odds of success are not great, and I may end up loosing it as well. I do better if I think ahead and imagine which situations could be challenging and prepare my child (and me) with a plan.
#3: Anxiety and anger are incompatible with a relaxed body. The first step to doing this is to belly breathe (instead of chest breathe), comfortably but deeply, both in and out. With anger and anxiety, the breath rises up and becomes shallow. With peace and relaxation, the breath drops and becomes deeper. The next thing is to relax all of the muscles. The metaphor I use is to try to turn each muscle into a cooked

How tragic indeed that this angry man’s rejection to the Prophet’s advice has been recorded for all times. Instead of heeding the advice, the man’s anger overcame him.
Remembering Allah helps us to monitor our speech and our actions as well, since so often the first lowly instinct is to speak ill, to curse, or to raise one’s hands in retaliation. The reminder to turn to Allah at the onset of anger in reality reconnects us with Allah at a moment when it seems we are being overpowered by Satan’s temptations to anger.
When you feel the onset of anger, in addition to seeking refuge in Allah from Satan, you should shift your posture so that you attempt to regain some sense of control of yourself and regain your composure.
It is reported by Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “If any of you gets angry and is standing, let him sit down, [so his anger will go away;] if it does not go away, let him lie down’” (Abu Dawud).
By focusing on yourself and your inner thoughts enough to change your posture and position, you prevent yourself from saying or doing anything rash in a fit of anger. There are positive physiological effects as well from changing your position, all of which lend to a more calm state of mind and body.
As youth and young adults, you must practice the art of self-restraint.

An unpleasant emotion, anger triggers the release of adrenaline, increases heart rate, and causes sweating, blushing, and sometimes “the crazy eyes.” But while unwholesome, the emotion or feeling of anger keeps our needs met, our boundaries uncrossed, and our interests protected.
People who cannot summon or use anger judiciously are destined to become doormats, inmates, or just plain miserable people. So this article really isn’t about how to get rid of anger, but how to manage anger in a healthy manner.
Anger will get the best of you from time to time—that’s just being human. But if you’re often suffering regret after mindlessly running your mouth, if your temper is harming your relationships and the people around you, then you’re a great candidate for anger management. Of course, if anger has ever led to violence or arrest, well, then you should certainly seek treatment. Your local hospital or department of health are great places to find out what is available in your area. They’ll be able to hook you up with a solid doctor too.
Express, don’t repress. Many people repress anger. This can lead to massive eruptions of anger and rage, or prolonged periods of seething, stewing misery. When you feel yourself getting angry, regain your composure before addressing the person you’re angry with.

Nine Inch Nails made a dramatic entrance Sunday night at The Q. "Pinion" announced the arrival of five silhouettes enveloped in theatrical fog.
During "Love Is Not Enough," frontman Reznor howled: "I've gone all this [expletive] way / To wind up . . . back at the start!" Truer words were never uttered by an industrial-rock icon who launched his career in Cleveland in the 1980s.
"Lots of memories for me here - some good, some not so good," Reznor wrote in a pre-gig post on NIN's Web site.
The concert began with the band behind a translucent veil, which promptly was raised for a seething "Wish."
In short order came "Terrible Lie," "March of the Pigs" and "The Wretched," with one ditty darker than the next. You could imagine Darth Vader seriously digging this stuff if he had an iPod built into his helmet.
The sonic blitzkrieg was complemented by a brilliantly conceptualized light show - pale whites and dirty yellows at first, with more colors creeping into the palette later.
By the time Reznor, guitarist Aaron North, keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, bassist Jeordie White and drummer Alex Carapetis got a cyber-funk groove on for the lustful "Closer," they were bathed in a bordello-red afterglow.

Stuffed down emotions, such as anger, grief, hopelessness, sadness and fear, especially when repressed for a long time, take a toll on the body. For example, fear affects the stomach and anger heavily impacts the liver.
Even when we are told to keep our emotions in check, repressing or suppressing what we feel is not a smart approach to, for example, anger management. If we want to live in harmony with ourselves and others, we need to find a way to feel our emotions and let them flow through us, while expressing them appropriately, without offending or hurting others.
Psychosomatic studies have determined the link between our feelings and the body’s major organs. When we live in anger and resentment, the liver produces an excessive amount of bile. Because this is something the organ would not produce in its natural state, the surplus bile causes acidity in the stomach; thus, we start experiencing headaches and an overall state of depletion and toxicity. The liver is the body’s second largest organ, and it regulates the digestive system, our metabolism and the body’s capacity to detox. The liver stores essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals, produces vital protein elements of blood plasma and sustains the immune system.
As the liver begins to malfunction due to a prolonged state of anger, the entire body struggles to maintain its essential functions. To regain a natural state of health, we can do a liver cleanse and an emotional cleanse at the same time.

What could be better than watching grown adults with silly names, clad in lycra, whacking each other with giant bits of foam rubber and pretending to take the whole thing seriously? And this time around, it's even better, allowing for nostalgia since nothing has changed about the show. (If only they'd bring back Man Oh Man).
The thing is, I've always secretly fancied the idea of being a Gladiator. Once you've regained your composure after falling off your chair laughing, the idea isn't as far fetched as it might sound. For a start, everything on the Gladiators set is padded, which is more, regretfully, than you can say for the real world. There could be a sort of "Gladiators Lite" for the wet, weak and weedy, like me. The challenges could be based around modern difficulties for pasty chubby office workers...first to learn to cut corners using a new database, most pints drunk at lunctime, most tourists elbowed on the way out of the train. (Actually the challengers could pretend to be the tourists on the train). Rather than a little lycra bikini, I'd wear a tracksuit with a torn knee and beer stains. And I could have a tough Gladiator name...Stapler.

The power of space and silence were never more evident to me than when I spoke before a gathering of college students and their families a number of years ago. The subject was the value of family stories.

She passed out a letter announcing her new homework policy at “Meet the Teacher Night” this year. According to Young’s new plan, students will not have any formally assigned homework; homework will only consist of work the student did not finish during school.
Young explained that she had spent the summer researching and found that it has not been proven that homework improves student performance. Instead, she suggested that parents eat dinner with their children, read with their children, play outside, and get their kids to bed early – all of which have been proven to correlate with student success, she said.

Hopefully this article will help both parents and teachers focus your thinking about homework and make good decisions for your student. Decisions about homework should be addressed by the whole educational team, including parents and, if possible, the student (especially the older student). If the team determines that the student with AS can handle homework, then thoughtful planning, collaboration between home and school, and appropriate modifications will ultimately lead to a successful experience with homework—and greatly reduce the tears and homework battles many families experience.
Homework: Education? or just “work”?
Ask any parent, teacher, or student—there are many benefits and challenges to homework! Homework is a standard part of all children’s school experience and usually the amount of homework assigned increases dramatically as the student matures through the grades. It is an unwritten rule: teachers, students, and parents just assume that all students will do homework as part of their school experience. Homework expectations are often stated in the student handbook. Homework performance affects grading, along with attendance, class participation, tests/quizzes, effort, etc. Teachers have various reasons for assigning homework: fostering independence and organization, enhancing study skills, reviewing material from the day, demonstrating understanding of class material, etc.
Homework is not many students’ first choice for an after-school or evening activity. Many other things take precedence—and that sets up the homework battles for students, parents, and ultimately for teachers as well. For students, homework becomes a dreaded burden and a chore. For their parents, daily “homework

Homework is defined as school-related assignments that will enhance or reinforce concepts taught in the classroom and which will require time and effort outside the regular school day for successful completion.
To be effective, homework assignments should not place an undue burden on students and families. The Board recognizes the needs of families that require commitments of time and effort and respect the particular circumstances that may exist within families.
The Board believes that homework is the responsibility of the student. The Board encourages teachers at all grade levels to use the parent/guardian as a source of support and to structure homework assignments, especially at the elementary levels, to appropriately involve the parent/guardian while promoting and maintaining the student’s sense of responsibility.
Lead to the development of good study habits and promote independent learning. Research tells us that this is particularly important at the elementary grades.
Research has shown us that the value of homework increases based on the design and the feedback provided by the teacher. There is an understanding that the kind of feedback a teacher provides may be dependent on the kind of homework assigned. The Board is not prescriptive in providing teachers guidelines for this feedback, but encourages all feedback to students be timely and consistent with the standards targeted in the classroom instruction.

“But…they are only in 2nd grade…so……” I trailed off; she blinked expectantly.
I didn’t finish my sentence.
“So… this is how the madness starts,” is what I wanted to say.
Homework has always been a bit of an educational “quid pro quo“ (Latin). The “give something, get something” in schools where a quantitative grade marks the successful exchange of educational services, the teacher, to the student in a paper-or digital-transfer.
Quid pro quo homework follows a cycle: the homework worksheet is distributed; the homework worksheet is completed; the homework grade is entered OR the homework is assigned, and the student is quizzed to check compliance.Non-compliance can sometimes bring a punitive action.
This cycle does not facilitate trust between teacher and student.
The quid pro quo cycle of homework has been customary practice in the upper grades, but recent studies are raising concerns about the increasing amounts of homework in the elementary grades.
Family stress, measured by self-report, increased as homework load increased and as parent’s perception of their capacity to assist decreased.
One conclusion is that the increase in homework at the elementary level is not only academically ineffective, but also stressful, particularly for families with limited educational resources.
A consequence of assigning homework as high stakes, rigorous, or graded practice in the lower grades sets up a disturbing paradigm that becomes ingrained in the upper grades. Homework becomes less about good practice in a discipline and more about student responsibility. In

For physics teachers at these schools, MOP is a means of solidifying the learning that occurs within the classroom. The modules are typically used by such teachers as both classwork and homework. Students are assigned a collection of assignments that are due at the end of the unit. Students complete the assignments as homework (and on occasion as classwork) and submit their encrypted success codes to their teacher. The teacher then validates the truthfulness of the codes by checking them using an offsite decryption program.
This system provides teachers with a painless way of making assignments and deriving grades based on student completion of the assigned work. But more importantly, the assignments themselves are mentally engaging assignments that can only be completed once a student understands the concept. Guessing and simply doing my best typically does not lead to success. The Minds On Physics Internet Modules rewards students for understanding physics. This mastery-learning approach to physics concepts does not mean that it is hard-nosed or insensitive.

But in a survival situation, the condition of your hands and feet can spell the difference between life and death. And if you're wearing a wedding ring… a ring stuck on finger injury can go from bad to worse very quickly. Check out this trick on removing a stuck ring with plastic wrap before the condition gets worse!
Editor's Note: I want to thank Nick for sending this video. Getting a ring stuck is a big fear of mine and I hadn't seen this trick done before.
As your finger swells, the ring cuts off circulation. If you don't get the ring off fast, you could lose a finger. This is why “ring stuck on finger” injuries are so severe, and you need to act fast to prevent further damage.
“Every now and then a ring gets stuck on my finger and it’s pretty scary. I live about 20 minutes from an ER, but I also don’t want it cut off.
Have you ever wondered why a ring that you easily put on your finger has so much trouble coming off?
The reason is if the ring is too tight, it will cause your finger to swell slightly, making removing the ring difficult.
It's important to wrap the elastic as tightly as possible. Once you reach the ring, use your tweezers to pull the elastic through.

Re: How should an engagement ring fit?
Sounds as if the ring has been sized correctly. I would wait until the weather heats up in July-August and our skin expands before making a final decision.
If at that time, it still rolls around on your finger, take it back for slight tightening.

I created this video to walk you through the process of measuring your ring size. You’ll also find some more tips for getting an accurate measurement below.
Always use a ring sizer that is approximately the width of the ring you are buying. Use a wide sizer for wide rings and a slim sizer for slim rings.
Start with a large size and move down- if you start with a size that’s too small it may get stuck and cause your finger to swell, leading to an inaccurate reading.
Remember that the “-” marks mean “and a half”. So an “8-” is a size 8.5.
You know you’ve found the right size when you can take the ring on and off with some difficulty (but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable to wear), and another person can’t pull the ring off your finger.
Lots of factors can affect your ring size- room temperature, salt intake, hydration level, hormones…you get the idea. If possible, measure your size on several different days to get the average. This is especially important if you are buying a ring with stones all the way around as it may be difficult to adjust the size.

Retrieved Text: Many factors affect the size of fingers, from temperature to stress, from activity using the hands to pregnancy. The size can vary drastically from one day to the next. Before being fitted for a ring, ideally you would take a measurement when your finger was larger so the ring would always be comfortable, but that is usually not the case. Over the course of time, rings can become dangerously tight. The goal is to remove the ring before that time comes.
You should be able to turn the ring in a circle around your finger. This means that the ring is not stuck to your skin underneath it. This also allows the skin underneath the ring to breathe. If you cannot turn the ring, ice your finger with ice pack for 10 minutes, then allow your finger to dry. If you can comfortably move the ring after icing, the fit is OK. If you still can't move the ring, it is too tight.
Being able to move the ring upwards on your finger indicates a good fit. Ideally, you should be able to take it off from time to time to allow the finger to breathe, but that's not always possible, especially after years of wearing the ring. If the ring won't budge, try icing the finger as above, then apply some olive oil or body wash to the skin around the ring. If this doesn't work, then seek the help of your doctor.

It is similar to the thumb removal trick that your Uncle used to do to you when you were five, but this is for audiences of all ages and it will really fool you. It is incredibly visual and when done with fluidity it will get a great reaction and often freaks out the spectators. Be expecting to hear “Do it again!”.
The basic effect of “On/Off” by Nicholas Lawrence is that the performer removes his or her finger in order to remove a ring. It’s a visual, convincing and unexpected effect. It’s also only a slight variation of an effect published almost 25 years ago.
The effect itself is fantastic and looks great. The plot of removing one’s finger to remove a stuck ring is delightfully absurd and surprising. And the idea of solving the problem of a stuck ring by removing one’s finger is just the sort of solution a real magician might come up with. It’s a far cry from the standard card and coin effects one typically sees performed. The method itself is clever, convincing and most of the handlings are impromptu.

Allergies are the most common causes of puffy eyes. Pollen in the atmosphere can cause our eyes to become red, itchy and watery, causing them to become puffy. This is called allergic conjunctivitis and refers to eyes becoming inflamed due to things like mold spores and pollen. When allergies cause eye inflammation, this is because your body is trying to defend itself against a possible danger or threat. This reaction may also be caused when you’re allergic to medication. Many people have hay fever and suffer from puffy eyes during the warmer months.
After crying, everyone’s eyes become puffy and swollen temporarily. This is caused by overflowing tears being absorbed by fine tissues surrounding the eye. Also when you cry, you have an increase in blood flow to your face, this makes the eyes appear puffy and swollen for a temporary time before the blood leave the face and the eyes go back to normal.
Waking up with puffy eyes is every common and can be caused by numerous things, the first being the position you sleep in.

Swollen eyes can become an ongoing problem, giving you an older, more tired appearance that impacts your self-esteem and the way others relate to you. Even the best eye cream for puffy eyes won’t help unless you determine the cause and choose the cream best-suited to your individual condition.
Fluid retention around the eyes is one of the primary causes of puffiness. Although puffy eyes can affect you at any age, it becomes more of a concern as you become older because the skin around the eyes becomes thinner. Thin skin paired with fluid retention makes the veins around the eyes more visible. This creates the black-eye look of extreme puffiness. Puffiness occurs most commonly in the morning since the fluid builds up beneath the eyes as you sleep. Sinus problems and allergies can exacerbate the problem and make the puffiness more obvious.
Eye creams targeted for anti-aging help smooth the wrinkles around the eyes, which can temporarily reduce puffiness caused by normal aging. Choose a cream that smooths wrinkles, hydrates the skin and also contains elements targeted at reducing swelling and fluid retention.

Puffy eyes are often caused by excessive fluid retention or swelling around the eyes. This can be caused by things as simple as late nights, lack of rest, or excessive crying after watching Korean dramas, to medical problems such as allergies.

The 64-year-old, from Exeter, was cycling his normal commute to work in October 2009 on Heavitree Road, Exeter when a car suddenly cut across his path.
He slammed on his brakes in an attempt to avoid a collision but was thrown over his handle bars and hit the side of the car.
The Stagecoach bus driver was left with injures to his head, elbow and both knees and ended up needing surgery and intensive physiotherapy on his right knee.
He had to take five months off work and when he returned found it difficult to drive certain types of buses due to the pressure he needed to put on his leg.
He still suffers from intermittent pain in his knee and in his left elbow.
Following the accident he contacted his trade union, the RMT, for advice. The union instructed Thompsons Solicitors to investigate a claim for compensation.
Thompsons were able to settle the claim out of court after the driver of the car admitted liability.
The bus driver said: “I cycle that route to work every day and I’ve never had a problem. On the day of the accident I didn’t have a chance. The car cut across me without any warning and I’m just glad I was able to react as I fear my injuries could have been much worse if I’d hit the car straight on.

But the route's rising popularity has turned the narrow road into a zone of conflict for Brentwood residents and the hundreds of cyclists who, every weekend, brave its twists, turns and tree-root bumps.
The frustration boiled over on the Fourth of July. In what police describe as a "road-rage incident," two experienced racers on a holiday outing that attracted about 300 cyclists were riding down Mandeville Canyon when a motorist in an Infiniti sedan slammed on his brakes in front of them. Police said the resulting impact propelled one rider through the car's rear window and sent the other to the pavement.
Police arrested the driver, Christopher T. Thompson, 58, on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly weapon -- his automobile. Thompson, who lives on Mandeville Canyon Road and is an owner of a medical documentation company in Woodland Hills, was released on $30,000 bail.
Capt. Bill Eaton of the Los Angeles Police Department said the case could go to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office as early as today.
Peter Swarth, Thompson's attorney, denied that his client had done anything wrong and said the cyclists' account was inaccurate. "This isn't an incident of road rage," Swarth said. "It is a very unfortunate accident. Dr. Thompson hopes for the injured cyclists' recovery."

The inquest was told that the 21 year-old had been travelling southbound on the Blyth Road at 1.20am on July 8 of this year.
He had just crossed a mini roundabout when he inexplicably veered into the path of the lorry.
He was pronounced dead at the scene and his family were able to identify his body through a distinctive tattoo he had.

Vettel recovered from a brake problem in the morning session, when he managed only four laps, to go quickest in the afternoon - but then had that session cut short because of a sensor problem on his gearbox.
Vettel beat Mercedes' Rosberg by 0.011 seconds in the second practice, with championship leader Lewis Hamilton trailing back in fifth.

WIDELY recognised as the world’s oldest scientific zoo, London Zoo has changed significantly from when it was first opened in 1828. Its purpose back then was as an extensive collection for scientific study and was managed by the Zoolological Society of London (established 1826). The 20,168 animals from 698 species there today are quite different from the now extinct quagga and thylacine it sought to protect back then, but its conservation efforts continue.
The balance between protecting them from mankind’s encroachment while exhibiting them to the same human species threatening their existence was not always an easy one. In the late 1980s and 90s campaigns by animal welfare groups increased and public opinion swung against the captivity of these creatures in a cold, rainy capital city thousands of miles from the tropical habitat where many of them once roamed free. Due to this lack of support and other financial issues, the zoo announced its closure in 1991 but in doing so rallied support from environmentalists and conservationists etc. who wanted to see it continue but with animal welfare and conservation at the forefront.
The zoo now runs a number of conservation programmes including its EDGE of Existence programme that protects unique species, which face an imminent threat of extinction. The acronym EDGE stands for Environmentally Distinct and Globally Endangered, and it’s own EDGE ranking lists the top 100 most endangered.

1. "Those who fervently love God are intoxicated by His warmth and live out their addiction like moths drawn to a flame."
2. "One night, a group of moths gathered on a shelf watching a burning candle. Puzzled by the nature of the light, they sent one of their members to go and check on it. The scouting moth circled the candle several times and came back with a description: The light was bright. Then a second moth went to examine it. He, too, came back with an observation: The light was hot. Finally a third moth volunteered to go.

Candles are effective for creating your own special meditation atmosphere and space, or you can use them to enhance the meditation with the use of aromatherapy.
Because candles are in most cases cheap and easy to get hold of in various stores, they are also a fantastic option to implement into your usual meditation routines. Here we will give you some advice on the best types of candles you can use for meditation, along with the benefits associated with each type.
(If you cannot use candles, due to restrictions on where you live, or where you meditate, you can also use different essential oils when you meditate). The candles listed below are also fantastic when it comes to providing aromatherapy benefits when practicing yoga.
When you shop for your candles, look for non-toxic options. Some candles contain ingredients such as paraffin, which is toxic. Candles that are made from non-toxic, natural ingredients like beeswax or soy are ideally the best choice.
You should also consider the color or scent of a candle when you use them for candle meditations.
This candle looks great and offers a number of positive meditation benefits. La Jolie Muse is known for their beautiful soy wax candles. We that the Jasmine & Ylang Ylang is one of the best candles for meditation.

Why does the flame go out when the jar is covering it?
The substance that reacts with the candle wax is oxygen. It comes from the air. Putting the jar over the candle keeps oxygen from outside the jar from getting in. The reaction can only use the oxygen that is already in the jar. So, when that oxygen is used up, the reaction can’t keep going. Running out of oxygen makes the flame go out.
Another chemical reaction you probably know is the reaction between vinegar and baking soda. This reaction produces a gas called carbon dioxide. This gas can be used to put out a flame. Let’s try it!

I can’t think of a fire more common than a candle. We use them every day for light, for decoration, in churches or on cakes. But do you ever stop to think about what goes on inside a candle flame?
Well 17th century scientist Michael Faraday did, and he says, “There is no better…door to understanding…natural philosophy than by studying the physical phenomena of a candle.” In other words, we can learn a lot about fire science by looking inside a little candle flame.
To understand why, we need to know about something called the Fire Triangle. The 3 sides of a Fire Triangle represent the three things that you need to sustain a fire: oxygen, fuel, and heat. The three sides of a fire triangle are a bit like the three legs of a stool. If you have all three of them, the fire sustains itself and keeps burning, but if you remove one, the stool falls over and the fire goes out.
So where do the oxygen, fuel, and heat come from in a candle flame?
Well, the oxygen is the easiest. It comes from the air. The air we breathe is made of about 21% oxygen, and fires can keep burning in air with as low as 12% oxygen.
How about the fuel? Well, when we light a candle, we hold the fire to the wick,

Allow me to share a true story. While living in Dallas, I was experimenting with a single-LED flame effect. I had two candles: one (unmodified) was lit, while the second had the core removed so the wick could be replaced by a yellow/orange LED and a small SX microcontroller. I was comparing the light cast by each on a wall; I was looking for my artificial candle to closely approximate the real one.
At some point, the real candle went out. I reached for a match and instead of striking it on the box, I unconsciously touched the match head to the faux candle LED expecting it to light! After a second, I caught myself and burst into laughter.

Candle fires are more common around the holidays, because more people use candles and decorations are often near them. Candle fires peak on Christmas day-they accounted for 10 percent of home fires on Christmas 1999-followed by New Year's Day and Christmas Eve. Home candle fires are more common in the winter months; in 1999, there were almost twice as many home candle fires in December as in an average month.
How does a little flame become so dangerous? Four out of 10 times, the candles were left unattended, abandoned or inadequately controlled. One in four times, something that catches fire easily was left too close to the flame. Sometimes children play with the candle. Sometimes someone falls asleep with one or more candles lit.
Four out of 10 home candle fires start in the bedroom, and two out of 10 in common rooms, living rooms, family rooms or dens. The most common item first ignited by a candle is a mattress or bedding, except in December when decorations are the most common first item.

After studying miss cat's "Hoodoo Candle Magic..." book as well as reading the forum etc., I see that when the wax arcs out to form angel wings that means someone or the situation is being protected by an angel. Personally, I work a lot with both Archangel Michael and my Guardian Angels; however, how do I know if I am the person being guarded or if the person whom I'm reversing the work back to is being guarded? That person is a skilled enough practitioner to know that the work is being sent back.
That is a good question, but as i view it, the answer is somewhat encoded in the intention. If the wings had formed on a white candle dressed for blessing yourself, that would be a guardian for you. However, you are reversing to someone, not protecting from someone. The candle is directed at that person, not at you. Therefore, the wings represent the guardianship granted to the one whom you are attacking, not a guardian of yourself.

Yes, you really should trim the wick to 1/4 inch every time you light your candle. If you don’t, problems can occur. The wicks of all candles can “mushroom” at the top, causing excessive flickering and/or smoke. Keeping your wick trimmed keeps this to a minimum and makes your candle safer. Trimming also prevents your wick from curling back into the wax – a common problem with nonmetal-cored wicks. Because our wicks contain no lead, zinc, or metal of any kind, they are very easily trimmed before lighting.
My candle leaves a lot of wax on the sides of the container when I burn it. Why is that?
This is commonly called “tunneling.” This happens when a candle burns down the middle of the jar, leaving lots of wax stuck to the side of the jar. Tunneling can be caused by failure to keep your candle lit long enough before you extinguish it. Each time you burn a candle, try to burn it at least until the wax pool reaches the edge of the container. Our jar candles should be burned a minimum of 3 hours the first time they are lit to achieve this. On subsequent burns it is ideal for the candle to be burned for at least 2 hours, but never longer than 4 hours. If you must extinguish your candle early, plan to burn it a little longer the next time. This should prevent your candle from tunneling.

Because essential oils are available commercially, you can also create your own aroma lamp.
Use a perforated ceramic or glass tea candle holder with an open top through which the heat from the candle flame can rise. The perforations allow the candle to get air. It’s important to select a container that is flame resistant.
Find a small glass bowl which can sit securely on top of the tea candle holder. Very small dessert bowls work well. Ceramic tea cup plates, which have a well in the center, can also be used. Note that the thicker the glass or ceramic, the longer it will take for the candle to heat it. Again, anything you use should be flame resistant.
Place the tea candle in the holder, and the small glass bowl on top.
Put 10 drops of your choice of essential oils in the glass bowl (or tea cup well), then light the candle. The heat from the candle will warm the glass (or ceramic), causing the essential oil to slowly evaporate. Add additional oil as needed.
If the oil has evaporated completely, extinguish the candle and wait for the oil-holder to cool. Then add the additional oil.

Nadi is a Sanskrit word that means channel. Shodhana means purification. In the yogic tradition, Nadi Shodhana is thought to purify the subtle channels of the body. Alternative nostril breathing is a breathing technique that activates the parasympathetic nervous system to produce a sense of calmness. Some studies have shown that Nadi Shodhana can reduce feelings of stress as well as fostering a feeling of well being. It may also increase your ability to take fuller, and deeper breaths. As with any breath technique, if this one causes you any discomfort, discontinue. There are plenty of other techniques out there.

I love candles. I can’t pass up a good candle. I tell my kids that when I’m old they better not let me live in a stinky house. I recently got a batch of tea light candles with wicks that were cut a little too short. The flame would get snuffed out by the wax as it melted. When I burn them, I have to pour a little of the melted wax out so the flame will continue to burn.
Once I get enough wax out of the candle for the flame to stay lit, it only takes just a little bit of the flame to keep the candle going and allow the wonderful smell to permeate my house.
Even a little flame creates enough light and snuffs out darkness. Even a little flame is something God can work with.

Prior to use, please read and follow the manufacturer’s use and safety instructions carefully.
Remove all packaging and labels before lighting your candle.
Place candles on a stable, level surface.
Always place candles on a non-flammable, heat-resistant surface – candles can become hot in use. Do not place directly on surfaces that may be damaged by heat such as polished finishes, wood, plastic or TV sets. Table mats are NOT suitable.
Remove any excess wax from the wick before lighting.
Before each light, ensure the wick is trimmed to 3-5mm.
Ensure the candle is free from debris – including match or wick debris – before lighting.
If the candle has been left out for long periods of time without a burn, ensure that the surface is clean and free from all dust & dirt, which can catch light.
For candles that do not have their own holder, use candle holders which are specifically designed for candle use.
Place burning candles at least 10cm away from other candles and ensure there is ample clear space above the candle for heat to disperse.
Keep lit candles away from all flammable materials and accessories such as hanging fabrics, bedding, carpets and papers.

The wax is a hydrocarbon similar to fuel that is used in vehicles. When the candle is lit, the surrounding wax begins to melt and is absorbed up through the wick. The heat of the flame will vaporize the liquid wax and that vapor is what is actually burning. When you blow out the flame, the resultant smoke that is visible is actually visible wax vapor. If the vapor is a continuous stream back to the wick, touching a lit flame will cause the candle to re-ignite.

Even mine arrived DOA, but I managed to get a replacement driver board. So for now, it is working just fine.
Anyway, I read on this forum somewhere that it is brighter than a car's headlights, so I thought I would test it the same way. I simply drove along and hung the torch out the driver's window as I was going along. Not very scientific, but a reasonable test, I thought.
It surprised me - the torch is FAR brighter on low beam than both of my car headlights put together. In fact, when you turn the torch off, the car's lights seem rather sad.They're also very yellow, which you don't seem to notice normally.
On high beam, the lights are about the same. Pretty much the same coverage, but again the SR3800 is a lot whiter, so it stands out a lot better. I think the high beam on the car has a wider spread, which is the main differnce.
Anyway - a good test. If my headlights ever go, I could very happily drive home using just the torch!
I did the exact same thing with mine. That is what got me interested in warm white and neutral tints. When i turned off the skyray and turned the headlights on I saw how good the natural subjects looked with a warmer tint.

Answer:- According to theory of relativity, it doesn't matter whether you are travelling in the car or observing the car from a distance, you will observe the light from the headlights travelling at same speed. Thus, an observer inside the car travelling near the speed of light will observe the head lights functioning normally, and will be able to see everything ahead of the car, whereas the observer standing at a distance will observe the car and light from headlights travelling at same speed, so he/she will observe that car's headlights are useless for the car driver as the light from them is not illuminating anything ahead of the car.

You might not think much about your car's headlights until they burn out or appear less bright as your car gets older, but as Consumer Reports explains, headlights are an important safety feature that needs maintenance just like the rest of your car.
Of all of the tests that Consumer Reports perform at its auto test track in Connecticut, this one might be the most unusual.
CR tests the headlights, analyzing things like brightness indoors and how well they light the road ahead on moonless nights.
"We're looking for things like how do the low beams and high beams give you visibility straight ahead are they bright enough, is the pattern uniform or streaky and will they cause glare to an oncoming driver or someone that you're following?" said Consumer Reports Car Expert, Jennifer Stockburger.
But if your car isn't new, you might have realized your headlights aren't in tip-top shape. Sun and the UV exposure can cause the plastic coating to become clouded or yellowed, giving off far less light that they had when you first bought the car.
"You may find cars are more susceptible to this clouding if you are in an area where there is a lot of sun - a hot state," said Stockburger.
"You have kind of two choices. You can replace the headlight," said Stockburger.

Even though a car's alternator plays a vital role in the operation of the vehicle it is a comparatively simple car component with just a few parts. The alternator keeps the battery charged while also helping to keep electrical accessories, including the lights, going while the car is running. Alternators are efficient at charging the battery at low revolutions per minute. As cars run off a DC current the AC output of the alternator is converted to DC by rectifier diodes.
Problems with the alternator may manifest themselves in a range of symptoms, from slow starts to a completely dead car. As the alternator is connected to other systems within the car a great many car problems can adversely affect the alternator and may cause some difficulties in diagnosing mechanical problems.
If a problem develops with the alternator you may notice the ALT or GEN warning lights on the dashboard. This may begin with a brief flicker of the warning light for a second of two.

Diesel particulate filters, or DPFs, reduce the soot produced by diesel engines to help eliminate air pollution caused by these engines. While early DPFs needed to be cleaned regularly, newer models are self regenerating and the filter does not get clogged as often with deposits.

However, ever since buying this car, I noticed one thing: the headlights are aimed too far to the left compared to what I was used to with Z-beam and "up sweep" headlight beam patterns. There is no doubt in my mind that this was intentional from the factory in order to meet DOT regulations. In a nutshell, DOT regulations requires sufficient "hotspot" luminance to ideally light up overhead road signs but also limit upwards luminance in the upper right side of the lighting area to limit excessive driver side mirror reflective glare of other cars.
The headlights are marked "DOT VOR", meaning you aim using the right side of the beam pattern's horizontal cut off line, with zero degrees of declination. As shown in the diagram above (courtesy/copyright of Mazda), the headlights are aimed to where the flat cut off line meets the down sweep point. The result: the down sweep to the left side horizon cut off line is far to the left.
I want even better lighting performance, safely, however. The European (now UN) standard had tighter glare controls, except for driver side mirror glare of passing cars. This is no problem in many countries because aside from USA, Canada, and Australia, convex driver side mirrors are allowed and in common place. Convex mirrors have a minification factor in what's in view, thus light dazzle is greatly reduced/controlled. Flat driver side mirrors (what is only allowed here) cannot

Clean and clear headlights might make the difference in spotting oncoming hazards.. Just like any part of your car, headlights can lose their luster and performance with age. Here are some ways to return your dim and dirty headlights to the brightness needed for safe winter driving.
Tip: It is important to note that headlights dim through a natural oxidization of the lenses, not just avoidable dirt and grime.
Homemade Remedy: While this solution is a bit more inexpensive, the effectiveness in cleaning your headlights varies from car to car. In order to remove this headlight 'rust' you'll need a gritty solution for polishing.
1: Use dishwashing detergent to wash away the residual dirt from the headlights. Then wipe dry with a towel.
2: Mix baking soda and toothpaste, knead solution thoroughly.
3: Apply paste to headlights with a towel. Rub in circular movements. Apply pressure to grind away oxidized particles.
4: Rinse with water and baking soda.
Store Bought Remedy: There are many products available at auto shops that claim they can brighten headlights and polish lenses. While they vary in price, their effectiveness varies as well. It is a good idea to read product reviews or talk to a service professional before purchasing these products. They provide a solution that you apply to your headlights similar to the homemade method.

Not so great. One way to avoid costly repairs is to focus on proper vehicle maintenance. Here are a couple basic steps to follow that will make your life as a car owner easier.
Perusing your driver manual is perhaps the easiest way to stay informed about your vehicle. All new cars come with this handy booklet, which contains information on all the features and operating parts of your car as well as proper maintenance tips (including the recommended type of oil, tire pressure, and more).
Keeping your car well-maintained isn't necessarily rocket science. There are a few key inspections that you can do yourself to make sure your car is operating in good shape. Checking things like fluid levels (e.g., oil and coolant) and tire pressure can ensure the good condition (and mileage) of your car. Additionally, keeping tabs on the condition of basic equipment such as windshield wipers, tires, and headlights can mean a world of difference when it comes to driver safety. These small inspections take a short amount of time and go a long way towards keeping you safe.
Pay attention to the service recommendations from your car's manufacturer. Usually, you will have to bring your car in for routine service every 30,000 miles in addition to regular oil changes and other checks. Follow the advice that you find in your

I wore black, chunky heels to continue that 90s feel. To contrast the "good girl" school look, I completed the look with a deep lip and rhinestone earrings. The lipstick turned around the "good girl" idea because of its semi-gothic color.

Select long dangly drop earrings to contrast.
Try to go for the opposite style to shape of your face. For instance if you have a more round shape face opt for earrings that are longer and if you have a longer or square shaped face go for earrings that are circular.
If you have a larger bone structure you are able to wear chunkier and heavier earrings such as statement earrings with ease.

The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed.
Hourigan said the police had reasonable suspicion but not the reasonable grounds required. Hourigan added that the search could not be justified under S. 221 of the Highway Traffic Act, as there was no indication that Dunkley had abandoned his car, which was parked in a the gas station parking lot.

The thing about baby skin is that it is a unique and essential shield that offers protection from the outside world. While a baby’s skin usually looks and feels perfect, it has special needs because it is more vulnerable to irritants than adult skin. A diaper rash begins when trapped moisture and friction irritate the skin. The irritation continues over time, and the harsh urine and stool inside a soiled diaper can make the irritation worse.

This is a big turn-off for women, can hamper your job prospects and generally makes you look unhealthy.

Folliculitis is the number one cause of shaving rash for men. This is a condition which affects the hair follicles on your face, and is where bacteria or fungal infections live inside your hair follicles. The problem is that when you shave, the stress of cutting the hair actually weakens the hair follicle and if it is infected, this will make it appear to be red and unsightly.

This is a meaty-spin on the Instant Pot Macaroni and was inspired by one of our MyFreezEasy members.
With this macaroni made in the instant pot, you just add some ground beef and whatever spices you want to get in there too!
There are 3 ways to get the ground beef mixed in with the macaroni, and I will briefly explain them below.
Brown the ground beef on Saute mode in the Instant Pot, drain off excess fat. Add dry pasta and liquid. Pressure cook, then mix in cheese and milk, etc.
Brown the ground beef in a skillet, cook the pasta in the Instant Pot, mix in the cheeses and milk, then mix in the browned ground beef.
Use pre-browned ground beef from the freezer, thaw it for a few minutes to get it out of the bag and add on top of the dry pasta and liquid. (See below!) You can add it still frozen on top, or you can thaw it completely and add it to the top of the pasta and liquid, or underneath the pasta and liquid.
Above you see option #3.
And this is option #3, just after opening the lid. The meat is all thawed, the pasta is cooked and it’s ready to be mixed together.
Gently combine the cooked pasta and beef.
Then add the butter and milk.
And stir it all through.
From here you can add different spices – Italian seasoning or Cajun seasoning or taco seasoning or Ranch dressing mix. Whatever works for your family!

Retrieved Text: What colour should my ground beef be?
Many people in North America use the terms ground beef / Ground Hamburger / Hamburger interchangeably. For producers, in the US at least, there is a legal difference they must adhere to: any fat in ground beef must be the fat already adhering to the meat content they are adding; for ground hamburger, additional beef fat other than what was on those pieces of meat can be added.
When beef is ground, far more surface area is created on all the minute pieces of meat than existed on a single hunk of meat. Combine this increased surface area with the extra handling and equipment that the ground beef has had to go through, and the ground beef gets lots more chances to pick up bacteria during processing. The cow may have already had E. coli in its intestines, but the processing increases the chances of bacteria coming in contact with the meat.
Consequently, ground beef must have no pink inside when cooked. Colour alone, though, isn’t an indication of safety: sometimes hamburger can appear browned before it is safe to eat. It must reach an internal temperature of 71 C (160 F). If you’re nervous about this, instant-read meat thermometers are very inexpensive now.
Varieties of ground beef are now being sold as regular, lean, extra lean, super lean, etc.
But what does regular, lean and extra-lean mean? The labelling laws can be unclear.
In any other kind of food labelled 10g fat per 100g serving, the math would indicate that the fat content was

If you’re feeling sassy, chop up a few jalapeños and add them when you season the meat.

I’m no huge lover of red meat, but I’ve got to admit that the recipe and video for araignées in Le Monde this weekend made my mouth water. The araignée (air-ran yeah), or spider steak, is a cut of beef that’s much more common in France than in the US, but even there you’ll need to go to a real butcher who works on whole carcasses. The araignée or gobet is the muscle that forms a hump at the top of the backbone. There’s only about 10 or 12 ounces of this cut in an entire cow. Here, it’s thrown on the heap of meat that becomes hamburger; there, it’s turned into a gastronomic delight.
Here’s a translation of the recipe from Le Monde.
Ask your butcher for spider steak. Count on 5 ounces per person, 7 ounces for bigger appetites. Take the meat out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking it so that it’s at room temperature. Heat a drop of oil in a pan and sear the meat on all sides until it’s well browned. You may lightly salt the meat at this moment (not before, or the juices of the meat will escape during cooking). Remove the steaks from the pan, and add a knob of butter to the pan. When the butter is foaming, return the meat to the pan and turn it frequently to “nourish” it for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the meat rest for 3 to 4 minutes.

We piped the mixture into four discs the size of our cake rings, as well as into ladyfingers. Chef suggested we pipe them close enough so that they were touching, kind of like a fence. Making individual ladyfingers might be more traditional, but it's much more difficult to assemble the cake. After dredging the tops with sugar, into the oven they went.

These creepy-crawly spiders will be a hit at your Halloween party. You can hard-cook the eggs up to 1 day in advance, but be sure to peel them first before refrigerating. Slightly older eggs will be easier to peel than very fresh ones.
Place the eggs in a large saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Peel the eggs and cut each egg in half lengthwise.
Scoop the egg yolks into a bowl. Add the mayonnaise, mustard, shallots and capers and stir until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the yolk mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip or to a resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off.
Place the egg white halves, cut side up, on a platter and pipe the yolk mixture into the whites. Place 1 olive half, cut side down, in the center of each deviled egg to create the body of the spider. Cut each of the remaining 48 olive halves lengthwise into 4 pieces. Arrange 4 olive pieces on each side of the olive halves to create the spider legs. Makes 24 deviled eggs.

I rarely venture from my predictable menu choice here, and consistently order the short rib rice bowl for dinner. I'm not too tempted to try another main course, not because I don't think I'll like them, but because the rice bowl is precisely why I go to Revel. It balances five main ingredients: daikon, short ribs, mustard greens, rice, and an egg so that each flavor and texture lends itself to the next. The crunchy, pickled daikon complements the tender, cooked-to-perfection short rib, and the rice and egg round out the dish. Before digging in, I judiciously slather the red hot sauce over the rice and stir my bowl, making sure the egg has coated everything evenly (the above picture is how the dish looks when ordered).

Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut a small slice off skin side of each squash half so they will sit flat while baking. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet.

Add a large dollop of mash in the middle, then place the black pudding on top.
Scatter the mushrooms and semi dried tomatoes around the bowl.
Carefully place the duck egg on top of the black pudding.
Use thinly sliced breakfast radish and cress to garnish.
To achieve the perfect fried egg its simple- patience is the key. Before I work on any of the other elements, I place a non-stick frying pan on a light heat with a splash of cold press rapeseed oil and crack the egg straight into the cold oil!
I then leave it to gently cook, nice and slowly, almost confit if you will, never letting the oil bubble.

Chef Sandy Giblisco, a research-focused culinary consultant, shared her recipe for this classic dessert with us! Using self rising flour makes it easy to achieve the perfect sponge cake texture for our tres leches cake. Of course, we top ours off with fresh Florida Strawberries!
Butter baking pan and set aside.
In a clean, cool mixing bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form.
In another bowl, mix egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy.
Using a rubber spatula, gently fold beaten egg whites into egg yolks until combined.
Gently fold flour into egg mixture until well combined.
Note: Try not to over mix or cake will become tough.
Spread cake batter in prepared pan.
Bake until golden color and cake pulls away from sides of pan when touched.
Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk, and pour slowly and evenly over baked and cooled cake.
Cover cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 1 day.
Prepare whipped topping by whipping cream until soft peaks form and gradually adding confectioner’s sugar.
Place sliced strawberries, in rows, over top of cake.
Cut cake into squares and top with a generous amount of whipped topping or place whipped cream on the side.
This cake is amazing and so easy!!!
I'm partial to this dessert. One reason is because I know the creator. But, trust me. It's fabulous. Even without the hazelnuts it's a winner.

I like to come up with recipes from scratch and as a trained chef I’m pretty good at opening the fridge up and creating something tasty my friends and fam will enjoy. However….in the case of ramen I made the wise decision to seek out help in the form of a recipe to get me through this challenge. It’s a 15 hour process to make this delicious meal properly from scratch – so if you’re going to make it, give yourself ample time (definitely the day before your event).
I chose to follow this recipe from Chow Hound for Slow Cooker Pork Ramen. Safe to say, it took so very long to make, but it was absolutely a hit.
P.S. The lipstick I’m wearing is Make Up For Ever Artist Rouge in Mat M102.
Season the pork with salt.
This step and the next are optional: Put a flameproof slow cooker insert on the stovetop over medium-high heat, then add the oil and warm until hot. (Or, use a frying pan for this step). Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, add the pork pieces and sear them on the first side without moving them until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the pieces and sear on the second side until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to

My subscription began with the arrival of the June, July, and August issues of the magazine during the past four days. The mailing address notes that my subscription runs out with the May 2010 issue.
My peeve is sending me two back issues (June and July) to fulfill my 12-issue subscription. If I thought enough of the magazine to get a subscription, would I not be interested enough to buy those issues of the magazine before getting a subscription?
This has happened so often in the past with other magazine subscriptions that I finally started complaining to the magazines and so far, each time I have complained, the magazine extended my subscription by the number of back issues they sent me.
I intend to complain to Sky & Telescope, too, but why should I have to do that?
Instead of sticking their new subscribers with back issues they might already have, the magazines should start new subscriptions with the next new issue. If a subscriber missed an issue, she/he can always purchase the back issue(s) instead of having back issues foisted on them unwillingly.

I ran to her and looked, the sting was not in her eye but just under it. The sting area was just beginning to swell and was turning red. I put a few drops of the Purification oil blend onto my index finger, and gently applied my finger to the sting area. Within seconds the pain stopped, then she went to work.
When she came home I asked her how her eye was. She said, "My eye? Oh I forgot all about it!" She went to a mirror. No swelling, no redness. She said again: "You know I forgot all about the sting all day. I just remembered just now when you asked me."
When applying ANY oil be careful not to allow any of the oils to enter the eyes or ears. Ear applications may be performed using one drop of oil onto a q-tip and do not go in too far, as an ear drum injury may occur.
If perhaps you get an oil into the eye, NEVER FLUSH WITH WATER. Apply a vegetable oil into the eye to alleviate any discomfort, repeat if necessary.

JACKSON TWP. The water at Lake Cable was so cold Saturday that Jackson Township firefighters spent more than an hour removing six-inch-thick chunks of ice from along the surface.
And yet, hundreds of seemingly reasonable people sprinted into the watery hole with glee.
Among them were Jackson Local Superintendent Christopher DiLoreto, Canton City Police officer Lamar Sharpe, Jackson Local teachers and lots of children wearing purple T-shirts. There also were dozens of shirtless men, at least one woman in a bathing suit and a girl wearing a panda suit.
They all took the plunge at Lake Cable on Saturday to raise money for charity as part of the third annual Jackson Polar Bear Plunge.
The plunge is a fundraiser inside a fundraiser. The Jackson Local Schools Foundation, a nonprofit organization that awards grants to enhance educational opportunities for Jackson Local students, organizes the event, but it donates half of the money raised to the charity of the team’s choice.
Event chairman Justin Hardesty said this year’s plunge boasted roughly 350 participants — the highest number yet — even though Saturday was the coldest of the three years the event has been held. At the 2 p.m. start, the temperature hovered around 21 degrees under sunny skies. Hardesty estimated the event raised roughly $45,000 in donations and sponsorships.

Rather than subjecting the participants to "normal" pain, the authors used a trick known as the thermal grill illusion. The thermal grill illusion is not the latest in BBQ technology, but an unusual – and well validated – phantom pain effect.
When the skin is subjected to an alternating pattern of harmless coldness followed by heat, it creates a sensation of "burning coldness", but does no damage to the skin. It is something akin to the burning sensation felt by anyone placing cold hands under warm water after a snowball fight.
The researchers applied hot and cold sensations to the ring, middle and index fingers to create phantom pain sensations in volunteers. The phantom pain reduced in some people when they crossed their fingers.
This artificial phantom set-up means the findings probably don't apply to most real-life experiences of pain. Would a woman crossing her fingers during childbirth feel some benefit, or would someone who has just hit their thumb with a hammer? Probably not.
We shouldn't get too hung up on the crossed finger idea, though. The concept behind it is more interesting. The study tentatively showed that pain might be influenced by how our bodies are organised in space and relative inputs from different parts of your body.

"It was kinda weird," she said.
The man told her she'd "better pick up her dogs," according to the woman.
The larger dog somehow got free of its owner, and footage from a surveillance system in the neighborhood captured the black pit bull -- now unleashed -- charging the woman and her small dogs out of the frame. The womabn said she let go of their leashes in an attempt to let them run away from the attack.

There are different causes for this condition. It can sometimes be due to the lack of sleep, aging, excess fluids, long hours of work at a computer, dry skin, extended crying, salty diet or stress. It affects both men and women of varying age levels. It is really not a big deal for men, but women make it a huge deal because it makes them look fatigued, aged and exhausted. That is the bad news. The good news is that you can eliminate those dark under circles with simple and natural remedies.
Lemon juice is filled with Vitamin C and contains skin lightening properties, which is a great recipe for removing those dark under eye circles. So here is what you do: Take a cotton ball and squeeze lemon juice on it. Apply it around the contours of your eyes. Let it sit there for roughly ten minutes and then rinse off. You should do this for several weeks. You can also make a paste with the lemon juice by adding flour, and mashed tomato and turmeric powder. Gently apply the paste under the eye.

For a cyclist out hammering in the sun, five beats is the difference between cruising and crossing his or her lactate threshold. And on summer days when heart rate is already elevated by the heat and humidity, keeping a lower heart can ensure that an easy spin provides necessary recovery.
The study observed eight volunteers on indoor trainers working at 50 percent of their aerobic capacity under a heat light while consuming either cold, warm, or hot water. The test ran for 90 minutes, with three water breaks during the workout and one at the end. Skin temperature was also measured, but only a small difference between the cold and hot water groups was found. The big change researchers was that the hot water group averaged 129 beats per minute, while the cold group was at 124.
Of course, bike frames provide little room for a refrigerator, so instead look to a pre-ride water-cooling method, such as freezing your water bottle the night before, or using an insulated water bottle .

Katarina Zarutskie was vacationing on Staniel Cay, one of the islands in the tropical region, and decided to go swimming with nurse sharks—which are mostly harmless. While floating on her back with her arms stretched out, one shark bit down onto an arm and pulled the 19-year-old underwater.
Zarutskie’s boyfriend’s father was snapping photos of her at the time and managed to capture the moment she was dragged under by the five-foot shark. Zarutskie was able to break free and swim to the shore. She held her bleeding arm out of the water to avoid attracting more sharks.
Speaking to NBC News on Monday, Zarutskie said she had heard from locals that swimming with nurse sharks was risk free. “My boyfriend’s family was freaking out when I went to swim with the sharks and I was like, ‘It’s fine,’” Zarutskie said. She jumped into the water on her own, without any sort of tour guide.
The University of Miami student visited a local clinic following the incident, but decided to fly back to Florida the next day after learning shark bites carry a high risk of infection. “[The doctors] now believe that I still have pieces of the shark teeth in my arm and I will forever have a scar,” she said, slightly concerned for her modeling career.

Although she was not invited, the evil fairy appeared there and stood before the little one’s cradle, invoking a curse, saying that on her 16th birthday the girl would prick her finger on a spinning wheel spindle and die.
The curse was heard by a good fairy, who performed an enchantment to avoid the terrible vexation. The enchantment was that, instead of dying, she would sleep for 100 years and only be woken by the kiss of a young prince.
As the years passed, the girl grew into the most beautiful young woman in the kingdom, and the king ordered that all spinning wheels be burned so that she would not prick her finger. On her 16th birthday, the girl went to a place in the kingdom thought to be uninhabited, and there she found a woman spinning yarn who offered to show her how it was done.
It was in this moment that the girl pricked her finger and fell to the floor. No doctor or wizard could wake her.

Johannesburg – A Kagiso woman has been charged with murder after her husband was found unconscious and unresponsive in a bathtub filled with hot water. The man, whose entire body was badly burnt, clung to life for three days.
Police initially opened an inquest case but began suspecting foul play when they took a closer look at the evidence. The wife, Lungile Ntuli, was arrested on Wednesday, more than a month after her husband’s death.
Ntuli appeared at the Kagiso Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
Speaking to The Star, Kagiso police spokesperson Warrant Officer Solomon Sibiya said the woman told them that on October 3 she left the house to go grocery shopping at around 11 am. According to Ntuli, her husband told her that he was planning to take a bath while she was away.
Sibiya said Ntuli told police she arrived home around 4 pm and was startled to see water seeping from under the kitchen door. Ntuli allegedly opened the door, shouting her husband’s name and following the watery trail to the bathroom.
“She said when she arrived there, the taps were closed but her husband was inside the bathtub and that it looked like he had been burnt by boiling water. She said she ran outside and screamed for help. Neighbours responded and found the husband inside the bath with burn injuries.

Robinson captured video of the moments right after the birth of a baby in the 5200-block of South Green Street. The mother lay on her back on the cold concrete sidewalk, her baby boy in the warm embrace of strangers.

This past week we put the Boon Flo water deflector and faucet cover to the test. The Flo goes over your bathtub faucet and turns the water flow into a relaxing waterfall effect.
My daughter is a messy eater (as you can see from the pic, lol) and the night we installed and used our Boon Flo was no different! So after her yummy dinner we went upstairs and I installed the Boon Flo, started drawing her bath and tested it out. The water pooled out of the flow like a calm waterfall.
Once her tub was filled I put my daughter in and let her play with the water streaming from the Boon Flo. She loved it! She kept her hands right in the waterfall and played in the water. Since my daughter started to stand up shes has been trying to stand in the tub which makes me extremely nervous but with the Boon Flo running she took her mind off standing and really enjoyed her bath time more. In the event she were to bump into the faucet spout, the Flo is made with a soft and protective material that helps to guard against injury.

Since I live with a brain injury, I am keenly aware that I can't take my health for granted. In addition to building around my current needs for sound proofing, trip-proof flooring and extra light, we also considered universal design elements on the entire first floor. In a broad stroke, this includes things like wide hallways, 36" doors, levers and pulls instead of knobs, rockers instead of switches, etc. But a big consideration was having a master suite on the first floor and the second floor.
For the time being, we'll be upstairs, next to our toddler son. When family and friends visit, they have a full suite to enjoy. As our parents age, we want our house to be a welcoming place for them.

Here’s a very simple tip for saving water that I never did until it was pointed out to me: when filling the tub for a bath, close the drain before turning on the water. I find that most people adjust the water running out of the faucet to the temperature that they want it to be before closing the drain. You can save water by closing it immediately and realizing that the small amount of freezing cold water that comes out of the faucet when you start it will be completely offset by the warm water your run afterward resulting in perfect temperature bath water with less wasted water.
Along those same lines, when filling a pot to boil on the stove, unless the recipe absolute demands it, don’t wait for the water to get hot before putting it in the pot, just fill with whatever comes out of the tap. Put a lid on the pot while you are bringing the water to boil and you will never notice the time difference from starting with warm water or cold water.

Note: I received the faucet extender at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.
I love the faucet extender and it is perfect for the kiddos. I admit I was skeptical about how this would attach to the faucet and once attached would it even work for the kids.

I love that water does come out in a regular flow just in an extended manner. The curve in the extender really helps to control where the water is dispersed. The water does not come flying out at the kids but it flows in a downward yet angled motion that helps to reach little fingers.
What is cool about the design is that smaller children can feel independent when washing their hands. The great part is that parents still control the knobs

Oh, all the usual mthods that you can get from your water company's website, probably. Use the dishwasher and washing machine only when it's full. Take showers instead of baths, and run the water in the shower to dampen and rinse your hair and body but leave it off when soaping it up, conditioning hair and shaving. If you can stand it, use the old water-saving toilet adage "if it's brown, flush it down...if it's yellow, let it mellow!"
Get low-flow faucets and spigots on everything, have drip irrigation for landscaping (or better yet, xeriscape so your yard can survive on the natural rainflow anyway), and have low-flow toilets (if they are old, just put a wrapped brick in the tank to take up some of the space for water). Have a dishpan of soapy water in or near your sink so you can drop used dishes into it and let them soak before putting them into the dishwasher, which saves the water you would normally use rinsing each item before putting it into the dishwasher.

Education is a popular topic in the 2016 presidential election, focusing on urban education. Eastern Michigan University is giving attention to this topic through the new Urban Teacher Pathway Program.
This program takes middle and highs school students from urban neighborhoods who are interested in teaching and creates a pathway to help prepare them for the College of Educations’ curriculum and then places them back into the districts they originate from. This idea came from a pair of town hall style meetings last summer, with teachers from Ypsilanti Community Schools and Detroit Public Schools, where they told Sayler, the dean of Eastern’s College of Education, what they wanted out of teachers and the school districts.
Problems addressed included a lack of teacher retainment. Teachers will come to their home districts to work but they disappear fast because of district conditions or the lure of higher pay in the suburbs and rural communities.
This new program is designed to help “non-traditional” students succeed in the program through a combination of financial aid, an expedited admittance process and social services.

Moreover, teachers’ emotions and stress levels have been found to influence those of students and other teachers. In Child Trends’ preliminary research on creating healthy school environments, students, educators, and policymakers all mentioned teacher wellness as an important factor in the overall health of a school.
Research points to several key sources of stress that can undermine teacher wellness: high-stakes job demands, limited resources and professional autonomy, and negative school climate. Heightened attention to student test scores in recent years has placed teachers under increased scrutiny, as their professional success is measured in large part by student performance on standardized exams. They must also navigate challenging student behavior and complex parent and family needs.

Some choose the ganjapreneur path after seeing a loved one benefit from cannabis, some can’t pass the opportunity for future generational wealth, others get in it because they simply love the plant. Regardless of the reason, more people are seeking and gaining employment in the vastly expanding cannabis sector. You might be surprised where some of them came from. Most of us know where names like Joe Montana, Mike Tyson, and Whoopie Goldberg came from but what about Penny Milkey?
Penny’s husband, Ryan, experienced a terrible ATV accident in 2007, which resulted in him breaking his neck and back. Opiates nearly took his life but, he was given a second chance. Cannabis gave him that second chance. During her husband’s recovery, Penny and her husband saw first-hand how effective cannabis is as a medicine. This was an event that changed them both. The passion that was invoked in both of their lives for this plant was something they knew they wanted to help others experience, so in 2013, they opened a dispensary. Because Penny was still a school teacher, Ryan operated the dispensary himself.
In 2016, Penny resigned from her career as a 1st-grade teacher to help her husband with the business venture. It was a change fueled by her passion for helping. A passion which was born in the classroom. While you may not think that there are similarities between being a 1st-grade teacher

Peterson, 54, came under scrutiny after 19-year-old Cruz entered a school building with an AR-15 rifle and killed 14 students and three educators on Valentine’s Day. Cruz later confessed, police said.
The sheriff said video shows Peterson was outside the building for “upwards of four minutes” while students were gunned down inside.
“What I saw was a deputy arrive … take up a position and he never went in,” the sheriff said at a news conference. “There are no words. I mean these families lost their children. We lost coaches,” Israel said.
Peterson resigned, and subsequently retired, at 12:37 p.m. Thursday after he was suspended without pay earlier in the day, Israel said. An investigation into what happened will continue.
Peterson’s resignation ends a more than three-decade career with the agency, where he was often regarded by peers as a dependable employee who could communicate well with both staff and students.

In some ways this is positive and reflects the growing recognition that we can tell much less than we might believe about teaching quality by observing lessons. On the whole I’m in favour of looking at students’ work, but, predictably, book monitoring goes wrong for pretty much the same reasons lesson observation doesn’t work.
The thing is, there’s nothing wrong with observing lessons, work scrutiny or any of the other practices used to peer inside the black box of teaching quality, the problems stem from how the information gleaned is then used. If I observe a lesson with a checklist of criteria like the one below, I will be viewing the lesson through a set of predefined parameters which will inevitably distort what I see.

The lawsuit filed by the women, identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, accuses the college of bullying the women into submission when they protested the probes. It also alleges that in some instances, instructors sexualized the practice sessions.
The use of vaginal probes on students as a learning tool was not denied by Valencia. Using volunteers, including students, for medical sonography training is a nationally accepted practice, a spokeswoman for the school said in a statement last week, according to Reuters.

Unfortunately, many of these classroom management plans involve elaborate systems of rewards and punishment. For example, writing students names on the board with check marks added next to the name for each inappropriate behavior. Not only is this degrading, but the effectiveness of this classroom management plan is short-lived at best. In fact, often times this classroom management plan can have the exact opposite effect on student behavior.
Likewise, rewarding students for behavior that is expected of them sends the absolutely wrong message. Teachers should not reward a student for acting appropriately in class. Rewarding appropriate behavior is not effective classroom management, it is bribery and the students will come to expect it. Don’t get me wrong, I am not speaking about a pizza party or movie after a week in which the students worked well in class. That type of reward is fine as long as it is unexpected.

First grade is a critical grade for children and there is a high level of expectation on results. First graders need to end the year as strong readers. That’s critical for their success for the rest of their academic career.
As a last resort I tapped into the Hawthorne effect as a motivator to get the teacher to sign on to first grade.

Ultimately these factors are important for a teacher to understand as they have the propensity to determine learning outcomes.
This post was written by our TEFL certification graduate Sarah L.
The teacher’s use of eye contact, gesturing, voice clarity and projection are all important considerations within a classroom setting, as they allow a teacher to build rapport and convey meaning. The use of these can ensure students become engaged, encouraged and interested in the class - such as if a teacher gestures to add visual interest or employs voice variation to encourage attention, - and are therefore an integral part of a teacher’s arsenal. Such techniques can be used incorrectly however which may lead to poor learning outcomes.

For this reason it is important for teachers to understand how such techniques can be beneficial in their classroom and to employ them effectively.

Las Vegas — A Nevada state court judge overseeing a potentially $2 billion jury trial over the alleged bladder cancer risks of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.’s blockbuster diabetes medication drug Actos announced Wednesday that the drug company and two plaintiffs had tentatively resolved their claims, likely ending a trial that began in August and was expected to continue for weeks.
Judge Jerry Wiese told attorneys outside the jury’s presence that a tentative deal had been struck, and that the jury would likely be released on Monday pending final negotiations amongst the parties. Details of the deal were not disclosed in court. A Takeda spokeswoman confirmed a tentative agreement had been reached and was being finalized by the parties, and an attorney for the plaintiffs declined to comment.
The trial had been recorded gavel-to-gavel up to that point by Courtroom View Network.
The plaintiffs, a man who developed bladder cancer and the family of a man who died from the disease, chose not to opt into a $2.4 billion settlement agreement that will resolve most of the roughly 8,000 Actos lawsuits pending throughout the country. The deal seemed at risk of falling apart when the trial began in August, with a higher than expected number of holdouts, but since then enough plaintiffs signed on to lock in the settlement’s terms, which offer an average

Ghandri is also suspected of playing a role in two other attacks in Tunisia that killed 60 people, mainly tourists, in 2015.
According to a statement from judicial officials, during the court session Ghandri ran at the judge, managed to seize his gavel and hit him on the head. It was not clear if the judge was injured in the incident.
Earlier this month, a Tunisian court jailed seven people for life for their involvement in the two deadly militant attacks in 2015, one on a museum in Tunis and the other on a hotel in a Mediterranean resort. The assault on the Bardo National Museum left 21 people dead, while 38 were killed in the beach resort of Sousse, some 150 kilometres south of the capital.

Heavy weapons were fired on Thursday in Ivory Coast’s main city of Abidjan as troops loyal to rival presidential contenders clashed in a deadly escalation of the political crisis that has gripped the West African nation since the disputed Nov. 28 presidential run-off.
According to Karim Hakiki, FRANCE 24 correspondent reporting from Abidjan, at least 30 people were killed in the fighting.
The latest violence came as supporters of Alassane Ouattara attempted to heed his call to storm the state television (RTI) headquarters.
Deadly skirmishes broke out as security forces loyal to incumbent Laurent Gbagbo clashed with protesters loyal to Ouattara.
Heavy fighting broke out as they attempted to march from the waterfront Hotel de Golf, where the opposition leader has been based since Nov. 28, to the headquarters of the RTI television station.
“We’ve been here… with the intent of covering the protest that was scheduled to begin from the Hotel de Golf, the headquarters of Alassane Ouattara, but the protest was never allowed to happen,” said FRANCE 24’s Cyril Vanier, also reporting from Abidjan.

East Timor’s ruling Fretilin party won the most votes in bitterly contested parliamentary elections in June following the ousting of the prime minister last year amid widespread violence, but fell far short of a ruling majority.
The party insists it has the right to head any new government, but is up against a coalition of rival parties headed by former president Xanana Gusmao that controls more seats in the legislature.
“All political parties have not yet reached agreement on a new government,” said President Jose Ramos-Horta, who according to the constitution has the final say on its formation.
Ramos-Horta has repeatedly urged the parties to form a national unity government amid fears that political tensions could again erupt into violence in the country, where tens of thousands still live in camps after last year’s bloodshed.
Ramos-Horta said he would announce a new government by the end of the month.
A spokesman for the Gusmao coalition said if Fretilin formed the government it would go into opposition. Such a bloc would outnumber Fretilin, meaning it could vote to reject the government’s legislative program, forcing fresh elections.
East Timor, which broke free from Indonesian rule in 1999 in a U.N.-sponsored referendum, faces major security, humanitarian and economic challenges just five years after it officially became Asia’s newest state.

The latest reminder is the killing, by a policeman, of an executive in Lucknow on Saturday — an example of wanton violence.
Influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy's critiques of the modern state, Gandhi had no illusions about the nature of the beast — be it the colonial government or even a democratic one. “The State represents violence in a concentrated and organised form. The individual has a soul, but as the State is a soulless machine, it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence,” he had said.
The trend is certainly not new. The State often mobilises support for its extra-judicial indiscretions and defends it by inventing many theories. There are thousands of cases of this nature over the decades across the country that got buried deep into the files without getting a glimpse of fair trial.

Charlottesville is now a by-word for political violence.
As you’ve probably heard, the Virginia college town played host to an alt-right rally that descended into violence on Saturday. Both the white nationalists and left-wing counter-protesters fought and beat each other with blunt objects for most of the morning.
The sheer violence and extremism on display in Charlottesville shocked the nation, and politicians all over the spectrum issued strong condemnations of the rally.
Foremost among them were Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Democratic Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer.
Both of these Democratic leaders were praised by the media for their response to the violence that unfolded. But, interestingly enough, few reporters are asking them about their responsibility in letting Charlottesville turn into a battlefield between political extremists.
Law enforcement was on hand at the dueling demonstrations on Saturday, decked out in riot gear and looking prepared for the worst. Except they weren’t allowed to do their job. Police on the scene were reported to have been ordered to “not intervene until given command to do so,” according to the ACLU. That kept them from suppressing the numerous scuffles that broke out.
When police were ordered to disperse the alt-right rally, that act directed the white nationalists into the antifa demonstrators, leading to further street brawls. Police didn’t seem to try to get in between the two groups or suppress the fights.

Nearly half of Americans consider immigration a major political issue, and the renewed debate over Central American migration is a product of the issue’s resonance on both sides of the aisle. While addressing the issue with contemporary domestic policy is certainly important, it is equally if not more important to understand the catalysts for this migration and the conditions that have continued to spur it on. In order to properly do this, it is crucial to understand the tremendous impact of U.S. foreign policy on the region.

This comparison underlines Yema’s innovatory formal and thematic focus on slow narrative time, sparse aesthetics, and fragile, intimate images.

This violence has emerged recently in the form of bombs sent to prominent Americans who have been critical of U.S. President Donald Trump, the 2017 murder of an activist protesting white supremacy and a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
When examining who exactly is behind this violence, the obvious answer seems to indicate the violence is perpetrated by radicals from both the left and right wing.
However, empirical data shows the level of violence carried out by each side is far from equal.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, between 2008 and 2017, 71 per cent of extremist-related killings within the U.S. were perpetrated by far-right extremists. This includes white supremacists, neo-Nazis and anti-government militias and groups. Meanwhile, during the same time period, left-wing extremism accounted for only three per cent.
A common deflection argues those who perpetrate political violence have mental illness or are inherently evil. But the disparity in violence between the left and right cannot simply be explained away by mental illness.
The disparity and overrepresentation of right-wing extremism clearly stems from the violent rhetoric of political leaders of the right.
Trump exemplifies this rhetoric to a tee.
While referring to protestors at one of his rallies, Trump said, “I’d like to punch [them] in the face” and “Knock the crap out of them.” He went on to reminisce about the days protestors would be “carried out on a stretcher” after offering to pay the legal bills of those who carried out the violence.

The Choctaws were part of the Five Tribes that were a part of Andrew Jackson’s policy The Trail of Tears. Most of the Choctaws were removed to present-day Oklahoma.
It wasn’t long after the Choctaws were removed that they heard of the Irish famine. Quickly, many Choctaws gathered money and sent it to Ireland.
Here’s a people who had just walked, in extremely harsh conditions, with the threat of violence, from Mississippi to Oklahoma. And now, they were gathering money to help other people.
It’s because of this act of kindness on behalf of the Choctaws that Ireland and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma have a special relationship even to this day.
I’ve been interested in various things tribal nations can actually do; things the United States doesn’t keep them from doing. Thus, I have been interested in whether tribal nations can form political alliances with other nations around the world.
The relationship between Ireland and Choctaw Nation isn’t generally classified as a true political alliance. But it could become such if decolonization occurs.
We non-Indians need to keep in mind that, as we move toward decolonization, tribal nations will be able to do things that our nation, the United States, is able to do. Forming political alliances is one of them. And we needn’t fear this or try to control it. We need to remember they their nations are just as worthy of freedom and respect–including respect for their choices–as we are.

PITTSBURGH...It's quite common for individuals, particularly men, to carry a wallet in their back pocket. Over time, this can cause discomfort in the back and other areas. This is why an inventor from Walland, Tn., has developed the patent-pending B.T. Jeans, an improved pair of pants, especially jeans, that incorporates a pocket upon the outside of one pant leg.
"As an avid motorcyclist and long haul trucker, I would often store my wallet in my back pocket during my travels. Intense pain developed, and I was diagnosed with a twisted coccyx. I developed my invention as a solution to this medical problem," said the inventor.
B.T. Jeans provides a practical and possibly fashionable alternative to standard pants. They can house a wallet within the pocket of a pair of pants. This eliminates a wallet from being housed within back pockets of clothing. Essentially, this will prevent pressure upon the sciatic nerve, which could lead to lower back pain, as well as the hips being out of alignment. This new pair of pants will be welcomed by the general population, but especially motorcyclists and truck drivers.

Besom pockets are pockets that are cut into a garment, rather than being sewn on. They generally have reinforced edging or piping along the slit of pocket. This edging can take the form of an extra strip of fabric or stitching. Besom pockets are commonly found on garments such as tuxedo jackets and men's slacks, but can be tailored into almost any piece of clothing.
Pockets on casual wear, such as the back pockets on denim jeans, are known as set-out. This is because they are attached to the outside of the garment and stitched around their entire edge. Besom pockets, on the other hand, are known as set-in, since they are attached to a point inside the clothing and only stitched at their top edge.
The reinforced stitching or edging along the opening of a besom pocket can take several forms. It can be a functional stitching; a decorative strip of fabric, such as satin; or a more elaborate pattern for decorative clothing. A satin strip is most often used in tuxedo jackets, or men's suit jackets, for a more formal appearance. Besom pockets can have a flap or button closure at the opening, or can simply be plain.

Start with a man's shirt with front pockets laid out flat as shown.
Take your 'pants back' pattern piece and place it on the shirt so the shirt pocket is in the place you would like the pants pocket to be. I placed the top of the pattern against the shirt yoke and centred the pocket between the side and crotch seam of the pants. The bottom third (approx) of the pocket was below the level of the crotch. This placing turned out well in the finished item. I placed a magazine inside the shirt so I could easily pin only the front layer of shirt fabric. Don't worry if the bottom of the pants finishes below the bottom of the shirt, we'll come to that in a minute.
You will use these to add the extra length to the pants. If these are not wide enough, you can use fabric from the shirt sleeves. Place the front and back pattern pieces on to the scrap fabric as shown.

The quality so far has been good and the pants have good recovery, but the print is printed on a white fabric so I am a bit worried about how they will wear. They are fun though!
As usual, I used my Mambo No. 5 pattern, which is a tried and tested amalgamation of all my favorite patterns. As usual, this round gave me some more ideas for alteration (I'm still working on some pesky knee wrinkles), but for the most part the fit is spot on! My secret is that the side seam allowance is a generous one inch, which allows me to baste the seam to test the fit with all sorts of different fabrics. In this case, I sewed the full one inch allowance

They’re adorable and I’ve had them for like 2 years now!
Now on to my recent shopping trip, a couple of days ago I went to a warehouse sale courtesy of Agnes+Dora. Even though I arrived late, there were still plenty of awesome options left. There were a variety of different patterned skirts, dresses, shirts and leggings/pants. For me it was hard not to go crazy and buy everything, it was that good. Their prices ranged from $2-$25. It was a crazy sale and I think that was a big factor in me LOVING it. I managed to grab myself a couple of cute items: shirt, skirt, pants, etc.

Throughout his life he was addressed as Maestro and is probably the most complete all-round talent ever measured as a performer, lyricist, musician, orchestrator, arranger and producer.
The Barry White story is dramatic right from his debut as a piano prodigy at four-years-old to a spell in prison at 16, to father of four at 18 and then ten years of often-menial struggle to finally make it as a global superstar. In 1974, he was briefly the world’s biggest selling musical artist.
The book is incredibly detailed and an in-depth study of not only the man and his multi-faceted life but also his music, some 35 albums in a 30-year career.
His music was all about love and from 1973 until the end of the decade, the birth rate in the United Sates went up five per cent. An article in the New York Times in 1976 attributed it to Americans making love to the sound of Barry White’s music.

Born in London, Chesterton’s career began when he verbalized his first story to his aunt Rose at the age of three. He experimented in the occult as a young man, returned to the Church of England, and converted to Catholicism later in life. His thoughts on religion influenced much of his writing.
Chesterton was also amazingly prolific—he wrote fast and barely edited what he wrote. He considered himself largely a journalist, and he wrote 4,000 newspaper essays; he also wrote some 80 books (covering fiction, criticism, literary biography, and theology) as well as several hundred poems, 200 short stories, and many plays. He made his points with wit and paradox, his large body of work contains a plethora of quotable material.
Chesterton is best known for his stories about Father Brown, a crime-solving Roman Catholic priest who seems awkward and inept—he regularly misplaces his umbrella, falls asleep during police interrogations—but knows more about crime than the criminals. Chesterton got the idea from observing Catholic priests, who listen to confessions all day long, but know more about depravity and corruption than do anyone else in society.
Chesterton novels include The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904,) a political satire that many readers consider his most entertaining work. The Man Who Was Thursday (1908,) widely considered his best fictional work, is presented as a detective story but its surrealistic turns and unworldly characters

Peacock was educated at home and as a young man he converted to Catholicism (influenced by Newman). Early in life, Peacock turned his attention to history and archeology and wrote numerous antiquarian works, mostly focused on his native Lincolnshire. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1857. He was a prolific journalist, contributing in particular to Athenaeum as a reviewer for forty years and Notes and Queries. In addition to his historical work, Peacock wrote four novels: the historical novel Ralf Skirlaugh (1870), the Lincolnshire set Mabel Heron (1872), John Markenfield (1874) about the U.S. Civil War in Kansas, and Narcissa Brendon (1891). None of his books were particularly successful. In 1853 he married the American Lucy Anne Weatherall and the couple had six children. By the late 1890s, Peacock was suffering financially: his farm brought in less revenue and his daughters remained unmarried. He received support from the Royal Literary Fund in 1899 and 1902. He died in 1915 at his home Bottesford Manor, Lincolnshire.

One of the first novels ever written, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719), the classic adventure story of a man marooned on an island for nearly 30 years, is part of our culture.
Dafoe wrote Robinson Crusoe when he was nearly 60 years old, and it is widely thought that he drew from the real-life experience of a marooned sailor, Alexander Selkirk who survived four years on a Pacific island off the coast of Chile.
Our copy of the 2001 Penguin Classic Robinson Crusoe edited with an introduction and notes by John Richetti includes a biography of the author whose real life was a bit of an adventure. He travelled widely in England and to Europe as a merchant. Dafoe also served as a secret agent at two different points in his life. He was also a political journalist. At one point he was pilloried and spent a year in prison for writing an ironic satire on High Church extremism.
We also have an illustrated juvenile edition of Robinson Crusoe adapted by Malvina G. Vogel. But remember, Dafoe was a product of his time and the racism that would have gone unnoticed in the past, is a startling to modern readers.

There are many hazards that can make tires less effective and more of a danger to drivers and passengers. It is not uncommon for a sharp stone, nail, or other pointed piece of debris to puncture a tire. Because flat tires are dangerous to use, it is advised that motorists only drive on them in extreme circumstances, such as when they need to reach safety from a busy highway. It is also important to note that the longer a driver uses a flat tire, the more unlikely it becomes that a tire repair service can be performed. This is because riding on a flat tire for too long can cause irrevocable damage to the tire. As the tire deflates, the wheel will come into closer contact with the ground, potentially damaging the rim. It is important to understand that tire repair is time sensitive. The sooner you are able to bring a lightly to moderately damaged tire in for repair, the more likely it is that the tire can be saved.
Why Should You Have Tire Repair Services Performed at MK Discount Tire Center?
The methods used by our service staff to repair a tire comply with the Rubber Manufacturer’s Association (RMA). The RMA states that a flat tire can be repaired if the puncture is ¼ inch or smaller and if the puncture is located on the tread of a tire. They recommend that the tire repair

While it may seem like your vehicle is just “dead,” in some cases a professional tow truck driver can diagnose your vehicle’s problem more accurately. Knowing what’s really wrong with your vehicle is especially helpful when trying to relay the situation to a mechanic. Depending on the problem, your tow truck driver might even be able to do something about the issue right away, preventing the need for your vehicle to be towed. For example, if your vehicle’s battery is drained, a professional tow truck driver can usually jump start your vehicle for you, as you’ll see below.
One of the most common problems that will prevent a vehicle from starting is a drained battery. Many towing companies in Tyler provide jump starts as well as towing services. Most towing companies supply their drivers with professional jump starters, so customers won’t have to worry about getting cables. Another benefit of jump starters is that they usually allow you to see what level the battery should be charged to, and how much energy is transferred. This information can help you determine if your vehicle needs a new battery or not.
Another service commonly offered by towing companies is changing flat tires. If your vehicle has a functioning spare tire, a professional tow truck driver can quickly change your flat tire out for your spare. However, if you are missing a piece of necessary equipment, such

In 1966, General Motors developed a product called Driver Aid Information and Recruiting (DAIR) system. To test the system, General Motors had Walter Cronkite try it. “As I drove the test car, DAIR navigated for me,” he said, “telling me when to go straight, turn left, turn right, and so on. Speed limits and other traffic signs flashed onto the panel activated by low-power transmitters along the way.” This system was a fusion of proto-GPS and roadside communications, a precursor to GPS. In those days, though, the system did not use any computers. Instead, it used punch cards. Yes, a punch card. To use the DAIR, a driver would insert a punch-coded card into the device, sitting in or near the center console with an on-top-of–the-dashboard display. The holes in the card would translate to mechanical movements in the car itself, directing the driver.
Like today’s GPS devices, DAIR was designed to “assist the driver with his peripheral functions so that he can concentrate his attention on driving.” Additionally, the system could deliver alerts about upcoming road signs or changing speed limits. It could also telephone help if the vehicle got a flat tire or was involved in an accident, much like OnStar does today.
By the late 1960s, though, DAIR was already replaced by more modern route guiding systems. These

Many experts say driver safety begins with tires, as they are the only thing connecting a car to the road. To help teens and young adults stay safe on the roads this summer and all year long, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company and the National Organizations for Youth Safety (NOYS) offer these tire safety tips.
• Check tire condition. Damaged tires can shorten tire life and even cause tire failure. Visually check tires for cuts, cracks, splits, punctures and bulges. If any of these conditions are spotted, or if there are any doubts about the condition of the tires, have them professionally inspected.
• Check tire pressure. Proper air pressure improves fuel consumption and helps prevent uneven wear of tires. It also offers drivers better control, which is important for those with less experience behind the wheel. More than 50 percent of American vehicles have at least one under-inflated tire, according to a Rubber Manufacturers Association survey.
To test pressure, wait until tires are cool — a minimum of three hours after driving. Then, remove the tire’s valve cap and press the top of a tire pressure gauge firmly on the valve stem. A reading will pop up on the gauge. If the reading is lower than the recommended level, add air and check again. Once the recommended pressure is reached, replace the valve cap.

Almost half of all drivers â€” teens or otherwise â€” don’t know how to change a flat or balding tire, according to a study by Flexed. Additionally, 44 percent of teens aren’t familiar with the steps needed to check the tread on their tires, and 32 percent don’t know how to check their tire pressure.
In order for your tires to have a longer shelf life and to prevent accidents, there are several easy ways you can maintain them in both the short and long term. The first and most obvious step is to buy high-quality tires. While your teen may be tempted to go the cheap route, explain to them that buying low-quality, inexpensive tires will likely mean having to replace them more frequently.
Additionally, your teen should know how to check their vehicle’s tire pressure, tire tread and wheel alignment. With this in mind, you may want to buy them a pressure gauge â€” these can be found at most gas stations and car parts stores â€” and show them how to use it.

Truck drivers have some options for changing the tire. They can radio dispatch to find the nearest truck stop and let them know they’re driving there with a flat tire, or they can attempt to change the tire themselves on the side of the road. Semi-trucks have several tires and can allow the truck driver to reach the nearest truck stop without any problems on the road. Truck stops are typically located about every 40 miles or so on the interstate. Therefore, a truck driver won’t have to drive too far to get help with their tires.
If the truck is in a remote area away from the interstate, this might require the driver to change the tire themselves. Most truck drivers should have a tire changing tool, which can break the bead seal that holds the tire in place and prevents the air from escaping. The bead seal is a small groove on the inner edge of the tire which rests on the wheel. When the seal is broken, the tire on the truck can be removed without lifting it. You will also need to remove the nuts. At this point, you would take the damaged tire off the axle and put the spare tire in its place. But

That’s because winter is a tire killer. This winter left our roads filled with potholes, patches and cracks; add to that years of neglect, and they’re a mess.
And it is precisely because of these roads that run flat tires are so great: Even with a full blown hole in your tire, you can drive 100 miles on a run flat (that happened to me; keep reading).

The Continental Tires tested here are no exception: The ride was comfortable, pricing is better and the safety factor can’t be beaten.
But potholed roads are also why run flats get a bad rap: they are known for a rough ride, especially over potholes. While SUVs or sedans with regular air-dependent tires can glide across small potholes easily and bigger craters are simply a fun ride, run flat tires hit every pothole as if you’ve hit a huge metal object, jarring the car making you think you damaged the car even if you didn’t.

I engaged in a lengthy, inappropriate relationship with a woman. While we did not “know” each other in a Biblical sense, it was nevertheless inappropriately romantic and affectionate.
There are no words to describe the magnitude of shame I feel, or grief from the injury I caused my beloved bride and children, both of whom have responded to my repentance with what seems a supernatural love and forgiveness. I thought too highly of myself and behaved without proper accountability. I have acted grievously before the Lord, in a destructive manner hypocritical of life messages I hold dear, inappropriate for a leader, abusive of the trust that I was given, and hurtful to family and friends. My church leadership came alongside me with love and admonition, providing counsel, strong direction and accountability. Where I have directly wronged others, I confessed and repented. I am still in the process of trying to seek reconciliation privately with people I have injured, and to be aware of ways in which my own selfishness has hurt family and friends.

The simulated response of balancing abrupt quadrupling of CO2 (abrupt4xCO2) with reduced shortwave radiation successfully moderates annually averaged Arctic temperature rise to about 1°C, with modest changes in seasonal sea ice cycle compared with the preindustrial control simulations (piControl). Changes in summer and autumn sea ice extent are spatially correlated with temperature patterns but much less in winter and spring seasons. However, there are changes of ±20% in sea ice concentration in all seasons, and these will induce changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. In summer and autumn, the models consistently simulate less sea ice relative to preindustrial simulations in the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas, and some models show increased sea ice in the Barents/Kara Seas region. Sea ice extent increases in the Greenland Sea, particularly in winter and spring and is to some extent associated with changed sea ice drift. Decreased sea ice cover in winter and spring in the Barents Sea is associated with increased cyclonic activity entering this area under G1. In comparison, the abrupt4xCO2 experiment shows almost total sea ice loss in September and strong correlation with regional temperatures in all seasons consistent with open ocean conditions. The tropospheric circulation displays a Pacific North America pattern-like anomaly with negative phase in G1-piControl and positive phase under abrupt4xCO2-piControl.

From the moment they met, Winter and Summer had clashed, for Winter liked the cold, rain and snow, but Summer preferred sunshine, dryness and heat. In fact, they were polar opposites.
So one day the four seasons got together to resolve the problem. Spring comes after Winter, and with her the trees and fields begin to flower and it stops being so cold. And Autumn, who follows Summer, brings with him the falling leaves, the start of the cold weather and a few rain showers.
At their meeting, Spring and Autumn tried to explain to Winter and Summer that they should get along, for all four of them are needed to complete the circle of life on Earth.
And that was how Spring and Autumn made Winter and Summer see that it is only by being united, and not standing against one another, that they can maintain balance on Earth.

While the spring and summer seasons may be the busiest times of the year, times have also changed. For many, the most advantageous time to buy or sell a home is in the fall.
Long-enduring misconceptions that real estate is a seasonal business, have given way to more pragmatic views. While it may prove logical for some to purchase or sell during the spring or summer, not everyone is limited by these constraints. There are distinct advantages to buying and selling in a fall market, often overshadowed by a long-held belief that real estate is a warmer season proposition.
Today’s homebuyers are no longer singularly focused on transacting the sale of property during the spring and summer. In recent years, autumn has become an increasingly popular time to engage in real estate. Driven by technological advancements, prospective homebuyers are now afforded numerous solutions to preview listings, correspond with real estate practitioners and discuss lending options with mortgage professionals. Millennials, Gen Xers and Baby Boomers alike, are no longer limited by traditional practices from a decade ago. Although fall was once considered by the industry as an inactive period, it now represents a wealth of opportunities.
Still, guided by traditionalist views, some homebuyers remain compelled to suspend their search during the autumn months; likewise, many sellers pull their listings off the market fearing inactivity. But, misgivings about the market’s potential to flourish in the fall is misplaced. While there

Like many Japanese, the Jesteress is fond of saying that one of the reasons Japan is so great is that it has four seasons. At first this seems a bizarre claim – fine, places so close to the equator such as Palau don’t have distinct seasons, but the UK certainly does… but when you’re here in Japan, you appreciate there is a very certain, very definite distinction between the seasons. Even though it’s been quite warm, the people on the trains are often swaddled in woollen jumpers, because it’s autumn. In restaurants we’ve been enthusiastically served mackrel (“an autumn fish”). There are posters advertising particularly scenic autumnal locations at the railway stations.
It’s often said Japanese society is very ritualised and subject to many rules. This extends to the seasons and the observation of the seasons. Whereas in the UK you might say ‘oh, it feels very autumnal today’, or talk about an ‘indian summer’, in Japan, the date says it is autumn, so it is autumn. Although this is rigid, from such rigidty comes a sureness and certainty and a sense of organisation to things.
Speaking of scenic autumn locations, we’re currently in Gunma where the Jesteress’ mother lives, and along with some friends we went to Lake Haruna this afternoon. I joined in with a horde of photographers comitting the fabulous foliage to memory.

Most of its rainfall falls between October to April/May when lighter spring showers announce the coming of the dry season. Ploughing and sowing take place between October to November when Autumn rains have begun to soften the ground. Cereal crops such as barley are harvested between April and June, and grapes, olives and figs are gathered in July/September when ripened by the summer sun.

Cephalotes atratus ants live in communities tens of metres above the ground where gusts of wind constantly threaten to send them spiralling to the forest floor. That would spell certain death, says Robert Dudley at the University of California at Berkeley, US, and one of the study team.
“For these social insects, if you can’t find your tree again in the Amazon, you’re never going to find your home which means you’ll die,” he says.
So the team, led by Stephen Yanoviak at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, US, has worked out how the ants avoid this fate.
The researchers found that falling ants pivot to fall hind-feet-first in midair and swerve in a J-shaped swoop to land on the bark of their home tree trunk (View a Real Media video file).
Of 120 worker ants dropped from branches 27 metres high, 85% landed safely back on the tree. Even after a brief stumble on impact, most ants marched back to their original location within 10 minutes.
If the ants were not actively controlling their descent, the authors estimate that a mere 8% of dropped individuals would land on their tree. And while the team’s experiments with blinded ants show that visual cues are important for hitting the tree target, exactly how the insects steer their speedy glide is a mystery, says Dudley.

I'm no exception as I've mentioned in a previous post. Avoiding casts around trees and bankside brush will save you some flies but it will cost you fish, especially large brown trout. One of the studies I found interesting in graduate school described the habitat preferences of brown trout and rainbow trout when allopatric (only one species in the river) or sympatric (both species in the river). In both situations, brown trout showed a predilection for proximity to cover (Gatz et al. 1987).
My own fishing has certainly supported this finding. In a good brown trout river, more often than not I've found willing fish holding underneath overhanging branches. Most of the time, it takes some casting trickery to place your fly or flies where the fish are. That's why Lance, Gilbert, and I focused so much on casting mistakes and fixes at the beginning of Modern Nymphing Elevated: Beyond the Basics.

Probably not, as the name “Sutton” means “town to the south”, but Sutton lies north of the river, and the district of Sutton with a river frontage, called Wigginshill and Greaves, was not part of Sutton at the time of the Domesday survey of 1086.
The Commissioner recorded the boundary as being the middle of the River Tame up to Water Orton, passing under the centre arch of Water Orton Bridge. Then the river widened with several large islands, the boundary following the third branch of the river, “leaving the first ash tree considerably to the left and another ash tree a little to the right”, continuing along the river nearly as far as the mill.

As I climbed high up a branch, hanging on, hugging it, the sun entered my bones like an X-ray with a warmth and brightness boring deep in my essence, leaving a moment of "All is Right with my World" framed in memory -- a glowing happiness. This feeling has returned to me my whole life, whenever I see a Mimosa tree.

I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication (Revelation 17:4-5).
Catholic cardinals frequently wear scarlet. Catholic priests wear red on Good Friday, Palm Sunday, Pentecost, and other special occasions. They wear purple on Advent, Lent, and at funerals. On some of those days, other colors are also worn, including white, green, black, rose, and gold.
Riches are lavished on the icons of Catholicism. Gold, pearls, and precious stones and pearls deck the statues of Mary and the saints in the Vatican. The rebuilding of St. Peter’s Basilica in the 16th century involved the genius skill of Michelangelo, Bernini, Raphael, and the other great artists of the day. The riches and treasures lavished on the stately buildings of the Roman Catholic Church are beyond description.
The official clothing worn by the Pope on special occasions is richer in gold and jewelry than any earthly crown. The papal tiara on display in the Vatican Museum is valuable beyond comprehension.

Coco Chanel had an interesting love life. She once stated that her nickname Coco came from the word cocotte which means "kept woman."
Indeed Chanel had many lovers; each one seemed to be wealthier than the last.
Her lovers provided her with places to live and introduced her to lavish lifestyles. So perhaps she was at times, a "kept woman."
In fact, some of Coco Chanel's lovers were considered some of the most influential men of the time. But Chanel never married.
Instead Chanel preferred the life of a mistress and maintained friendship with her lovers long after their affairs ended.
When Chanel was 23 she became the mistress of a French ex-cavalry officer and wealthy textile heir Etienne Balsan.

Given that Will and Kate have maintained close connections with their small, tight-knit group of friends, it was no surprise that Charlotte was back in her familiar role as flower girl for her godmother's wedding. Prince George was also a part of the wedding party as a page boy, making this the third time the brother-sister duo has participated in a major, public wedding.

Her gown looked...familiar, to say the least.
The collared, deep-V neckline of the lace bodice bore much resemblance to Kate's custom Alexander McQueen gown by Sarah Burton. But there were also some differences: rather than a full, lace-appliquéd skirt, Carter's wedding gown was a simple silk crepe; and rather than a diamond tiara from the crowned jewels, Carter donned a silk headband, and accented the look with a lace-trimmed veil.

As we know, another person’s ego can be your foe. In her book, “No One Understands You And What To Do About It,” social psychologist Heidi Grant Halvorson explains that when someone feels threatened by your potential superiority and success, their egos can run amok and cause them to downplay your successes and even distance themselves from you.
Flattery, however, can be the great vanquisher — if used correctly.
Yes, we know honesty is a virtue, but there's also a pretty practical reason for this.
Humans have this innate desire to be seen by others as they see themselves -- this desire is called self-verification.
According to Halvorson, people become really uncomfortable when they get compliments they don't feel they deserve, so it's important your affirmations match up with their own sense of reality.
While you could explicitly praise someone's words or deeds, this might feel too forced for some, and Halvorson says flattery might come easier to them in the form of a question.
The goal is to ask anything that would get the other person to think about what makes them and their lives so meaningful.
Too much flattery can offend, but Halvorson says there's a good chance you're not in any danger of this.
In her book, she dedicates an entire chapter to how much less we communicate than we think we do -- in short, it's a lot less.

She ordered the same drink that I was going to, so when I got to the register I made a joke about copying her and then complimented her on the jacket. She sheepishly said that she needed the ruffles since she felt she looked too much like a boy with the short hair.

If you've recently had a baby, you may want to light a candle to commemorate the event. A candle lit to celebrate the birth of a baby can have several meanings that may help you and your family make the occasion even more special.
The type of candle that is lit at the baby's birth can represent several things. For instance, a blue candle usually means the baby has just come into the world; a candle in the shape of a cross can welcome a baby into a Christian home.
At a baby-naming ceremony or christening, a candle is sometimes lit for the newborn as a sign that the child's loved ones want the baby's path through life to be illuminated by a spiritual source. Since candles are also used to represent someone's memory, stillborn babies are often honored by a lit candle. The candles can be displayed at the child's vigil, and are sometimes lit on behalf of the mother to comfort her.
Some parents choose to light a candle in honor of their newborn to signify that the child has brought light and happiness to their lives. Lighting the candle for this purpose can take place immediately after the baby is delivered or during a ceremony to introduce the baby to loved ones.

I frequently light candles. Then I pray. They go hand in hand ... a symbolic ritual which takes my mind to a place of prayer.
Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.
Lighting a candle is a form of prayer, a good candle can burn continuously for days, but you cannot possibly keep praying for days, so the candle keeps praying even when you cannot.

What are the Sundays in Advent 2018?
In Western Christianity, Advent begins on the fourth Sunday prior to Christmas Day, or the Sunday which falls closest to November 30. The season of Advent lasts through Christmas Eve, or December 24. When Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday, it is the last or fourth Sunday of Advent.
For denominations that celebrate Advent, the holiday marks the beginning of the church's liturgical year. Advent is primarily observed in churches that adhere to an ecclesiastical calendar of liturgical seasons, feasts, memorials, fasts, and holy days. Those churches include Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican / Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian.
The season of Advent is a period of both repentance and celebration. Christians spend time in spiritual preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ at Christmas. Believers remember not only Christ's first coming to earth as a human baby but also celebrate his continued presence with us today through the Holy Spirit. Advent is also a time for worshipers to anticipate his return at the Second Coming of Christ.
The word "advent" comes from the Latin term "adventus" which means "arrival" or "coming," particularly the arrival of something or someone of great significance.
The lighting of an Advent Wreath is a traditional custom that originated in 16th-century Germany. On the branches of the wreath are four candles: three purple and one pink candle. In the center of the wreath sits a white candle.

Evergreens were an ancient symbol of immortality, life and growth, and the everlasting love of God. The shape of the wreath, a circle, symbolizes the unending eternity of God.
Each Sunday a different candle is lit. On the first, second and fourth Sundays, a purple candle is lit. The Rose candle is lit on the third Sunday symbolizing the joy surrounding the impending birth of Jesus. Traditionally on Christmas Eve the advent wreath in church will have a white candle in the middle, known as the Christ candle. White symbolizes purity and joy. When the 4 candles from the previous weeks are lit along with the Christ candle, it is symbolic of the coming of God’s presence overcoming darkness in the world with the arrival of Christ the Messiah (Isaiah.9:2).

It is especially important that children understand that Christmas is not just a time for parties, gifts, and festivities, but that Jesus is the reason for the season.
Advent begins the fourth Sunday before Christmas, which for most years means the last Sunday in November. It is a good way to transition between Thanksgiving celebrations and the Christmas season.
In some homes and churches, an ADVENT WREATH is used. Historically, this practice began in the 1600’s, although candles have represented “The Light coming into a dark world” for perhaps far longer. The wreath, a circle, represents an unending symbol, from creation to the end of time, God’s sovereign plan for our salvation.
The wreath consists of four candles set into a circle of evergreens, with a fifth candle, usually in the center, called the Christ candle. Each Sunday, one candle is lit as the father in the home reads the scripture, until ultimately all five candles are lit. They can also be lit at mealtimes during the week, with discussion of Jesus, the Light of the World.

The advent "wreath" consists of 4 candles (sometimes 5) surrounded by evergreens (and whatever else you'd like to throw in there). Where the wreath requires wiring the greens to a frame, the centerpiece doesn't take as much effort or supplies, but I'll still refer to it as a "wreath" because...it just sounds better. The advent "wreath" is a symbolic way to prepare your hearts and can be a fun and tangible way to get your kids involved. There are 3 purple candles and one pink. Sometimes people add a white one to light on Christmas.
This is a "tradition" meaning there is no right or wrong way to include the advent "wreath". Each candle represents something, commonly the first candle lit on the 1st Sunday in Advent is purple and represents hope. On the 2nd Sunday in Advent you light another purple candle, for love. The 3rd candle is the pink one, for joy. And the 4th candle lit is purple, for peace. The white candle, if you choose to add one, can go in the center and is lit on Christmas Day.
We have enjoyed doing a family devotional along with lighting the candles. There are many out there to choose from. Or you can just read a little bit of the Christmas story each time and sing some Christmas songs.

In other cases, the criminals are caught, but the booty is never found. Other scenarios have the criminals escape and live long and happy lives on tropical islands and other beautiful places that offer tax-free banking.
A heist that has yet to be made into a film has been in the news recently. It took place during the Easter Bank Holiday weekend of April 3rd, 2015 in London, England. The heist took place in Hatton Garden, which is known as the jewelry district of London and diamond trading center.

Thieves choose their targets based on a balance between risk and reward. A security system increases the risk of being caught, and a security camera increases the risk of being identified. Both of these options become a power set of tools that help keep your property and your heating and cooling system safe from thieves. A camera system should be installed at sufficient height so that a can of spray paint does not render it useless. The plus of installing a security system is that you may save money on the cost of your house insurance.
Like an alarm system, light is dangerous to thieves. People who steal like the cover of darkness because it helps them move unnoticed, and it keeps their identity secret. A lighting system increases the chance of getting caught or being recorded on a security camera. Install lighting out of reach because thieves may try to destroy the light source.
A steel cover works better than a chain link fence because chain link fencing can be cut. A steel cage makes it more difficult to gain access to the valuable parts inside of your HVAC unit. Both of these options increase the time frame that is required for a

There are no details yet on how the thieves got in and out of the warehouse, but law enforcement is reporting that the thieves made off with 2 pallets of iPads Mini. That's 3,600 devices, with an estimated retail of $1,500,000.
These wealth redistributors were interrupted while loading the iPads in to their truck, and they left 3 pallets behind. “So, as a caper goes, it was probably unsuccessful,” a source said.

This magazine cover, like all Rockwell's earlier published works, is hard to find in pristine (VF or better) condition. The higher grades generally sell for more than one hundred dollars, sometimes much more.
In this Norman Rockwell picture, we see three characters in an amusing situation. All three are dressed for a party.
On the left is the younger man. He actually looks to be a boy. He is holding his dance card in his right hand. His left hand is extended and touching the young girl's shoulder. He is trying to get the attention of his prospective dance partner.
The younger man is dressed in a suit and tie. Yet he seems somewhat underdressed compared to the older man.
Will he be able to draw the young lady's attention away from the man in the tuxedo?

From Deepika Padukone and Aditi Rao Hydari (both in Gaurav Gupta) to Sunny Leone in Rippii Sethi to Waluscha De Sousa in Gauri and Nainika, the ladies had us floored.

We ask: Does formal clothing display appropriate respect for God? What attire is appropriate to wear in the presence of God.
Advocates of wearing jeans emphasize what Jesus and His disciples wore during His time here on earth. Of course, jeans hadn’t been invented, but most of the disciples came from the jeans strata of society. (Matthew, Zacchaeus, and Nicodemus would have been exceptions.) We have every reason to believe that Jesus dressed appropriately for the audiences he spent most of His time with; a Son of Man who had nowhere to lay His head was rather unlikely to wear upper-class or royal robes. Some say it is appropriate to dress as Jesus did when reaching the lost and training His disciples—and as His followers did in His presence.
Meanwhile, suit advocates emphasize that that Jesus is now glorified. They would advocate that formal clothes are far more appropriate to honor Jesus as He is now than casual clothing.
This might surprise anyone who knows the extent to which I’m a fan of traditional quartets (and matching suits), but I’m not entirely convinced by the second position.

Ben Williamson, 33, returned to his van parked in the Queen&apos;s Street car park in Louth on Saturday, December 16, only to discover a parking ticket attached to his windscreen for ‘overlapping’.
The self-employed plumber and builder accepts that his vehicle may have been too big for the space, but plans to appeal after arguing it is unfair as he had paid for a ticket and claims he wasn’t impeding any other vehicles.
“I don’t know if pathetic is the right word to describe putting a ticket on a vehicle in a car park that is obviously 18 inches too long for the space,” he said.
Mr Williamson, who paid for one hour of parking, feels so aggrieved that he posted about his situation on social media – and received an overwhelming chorus of support.
One woman defended his parking and urged for spaces to be made bigger.
One person even accused the council of wanting to deter people from visiting the town.
However, the council insist they are just following the rules.
A spokesperson for East Lindsey District Council, said: “Our Parking Officers are asked to issue tickets in certain situations, including a vehicle not parking wholly within a marked bay.

I love when the media alerts the driving public about hidden parking traps and confusing parking ticket practices and procedures. Especially when the report motivates the Evil Empire and Department of Transportation to rectify their questionable behavior.
The “Payment Amount” (circled in red) includes a base fine of $115 plus a $10 late penalty. However, this is a secret, and the payment amount shown on the app differs from the amount entered on the parking ticket. The total amount a driver must pay to eliminate his debt is $125. An unsuspecting driver may not be aware of this important bit of information, and simply think it is a mistake…A very costly mistake.
If a driver pays a lesser amount, or the base fine only, the penalty will remain outstanding. Additional penalties will be assessed after 61 and 81 days following the issuance of the parking ticket. After 100 days, a driver will owe the Evil Empire $60 in penalties, despite paying the base fine. And, a judgment will be entered for the amount still due.
Then, interest on the outstanding parking ticket debt will accrue.

After the show was over, he couldn't remember where he had parked it, so he looked. For five days. He checked all the parking garages in the area. Emails were sent to anyone he thought would be able to help. Finally the vehicle's owner reported it as lost or stolen in August.
Police came across the BMW Friday in a parking garage. The cops checked records, discovered the vehicle had been reported as lost and then told the owner.
Of course, they had to tweet about it.
"Officers have found a car in a multi-storey lost since June," the Greater Manchester Police wrote. "We can't imagine what the ticket machine is going to say when they finally put the ticket in."

Lee said: “The gentleman and lady in question are friends of mine and they have bought a big campervan.
“I saw their campervan and thought, ‘I’m going to do it’, and put a joke parking ticket on, but I believe they didn’t see on the back it was a joke and called the council about it. It clearly said on the back of the ticket it was a prank.
“There is nothing untoward, it was just a prank that went wrong. Because of the power of social media, it has gone viral. It’s exploded – it’s just mayhem. It’s been shared so much.

Sagal was best known for her horror game “Homesick,” which follows the story of a woman searching for her friends inside the house where her family was murdered.

But, according to Eurogamer, the money was instead used for gender alteration surgery.

She answered in the affirmative, after which I asked her husband, if he had any objection; he said he had none. Then we laid our hands on her head and blessed her, promising her perfect heath, in the name of Jesus Christ, even to the renovating of her whole system. She has a very large neck which protruded beyond her chin—a disease commonly known as goiter. In the morning she was entirely well, all signs of the goiter having disappeared. We left that morning and had gone for miles on our way when we were overtaken by a messenger, and asked to return, as Mrs. Hoard desired to be baptized; so we returned.

This poor woman, who is now in her eighties, has dragged herself around for fifty years like this. She used to walk with crutches, but had to give them up as she kept falling down. Most recently, she walked supporting much of her weight with her hands pressing down on a plastic stool. When even that was becoming impossible due to the worsening arthritis in her "good" knee and in her arms, she came to the Traditional Medicine Hospital of Da Nang in a desperate quest for help. At this point, her entire body appeared twisted from the decades of maladaptive ambulation to which she had been reduced. There was no quick fix available for her.

The universe has shrunk. It must be a nice day outside, because the living room is bright. Most of the day is experienced with a single view, from the sofa. There are distractions and points of focus, and a few channels to the outside world.
Two weeks after breaking the bone, it still seems important to keep it horizontal as much as possible to promote healing. Some normal simple household tasks are completely impossible, while others can only be done at the expense of too much time spent with the leg vertical. Keep a close eye on the toes, if they start to darken, stop and elevate the leg above the heart until it normalises again. Make sure you don’t put pressure on the cast, or on the leg within the cast.
A dining chair has been moved into the kitchen, so that cooking and washing up can be done sitting down if needed. Eating can be done at the site of food preparation. Getting food from the fridge is quite complicated and difficult, still.

Most of us like to think that we’re compassionate people – that, given the opportunity, we’d recognize another’s pain and be moved to help. But in the midst of our daily lives, how compassionate are we, really? And is this something we can change about ourselves?
These questions were at the heart of a recent study led by Paul Condon, a graduate student studying social psychology with Dr. David DeSteno at Northeastern University. The experiment offered participants eight weeks of meditation instruction. Meeting for two hours each week, half of the participants were taught techniques to foster mindfulness, and the other half were trained in compassion. A comparison group of people who were also interested in learning meditation received their training after the study was complete.
After eight weeks of instruction, participants took various cognitive tests, believing that the experiment was measuring the effect of meditation on things like attention and memory. However, the real goal was to understand changes in compassionate helping behavior. This is where the experiment got elegantly clever.
The set-up went as follows. When a participant arrived for their cognitive testing at the end of the study, he or she entered a waiting room to find three chairs, two of which were occupied. Unbeknownst to the participant, the two other people in the waiting room were “confederates” – colleagues who were part of the study, but posing as bystanders.

A few days ago, I had this interesting conversation with a patient’s son. He told me about his family’s experiences with homeopathy in the past.
His own case – at a young age, he had developed a kind of hip joint degeneration where the doctors insisted that nothing could be done for him apart from a hip replacement. He would not be able to walk normally without a surgery since the cartilage was all gone as well. He was patched up with plates and screws and could only walk with crutches.
6 months later, this young man could walk normally without crutches. He visited the old doctor who was on his deathbed. When our young man walked in and stood there, an obvious testament to what Dr. Phatak’s homeopathy had achieved, the old doctor just smiled and joined his hands in the old Indian greeting. He passed away the next day.
This young man narrated another incident where a lady had a ping-pong ball sized brain tumour. The homeopath (don’t know who) laughed and guaranteed that he’d make it vanish. And that’s exactly what happened, much to the disbelief of the allopaths.
Such feel-good true stories and wonderful confidence is truly heart-warming.

I sat among the rocks where the milkhouse once stood and felt, for the first time, the fragility of life.

try putting oil on the needle and see if it will not stick on that. Are you using a sewing machine or sewing by hand?
I'm trying to use a machine but it looks like hand may be the answer. I can then oil it more frequently.
If you have a stainless steel needle, you can try wetting it and the thread with water. Duct tape adhesive doesn't stick well to wet surfaces. Also, you can wipe the needle and thread with isopropyl alcohol. I personally prefer the alcohol method using 91% or higher concentration isopropyl alcohol. You need to be aware that excess alcohol can dissolve some or all of the adhesive on the tape where the needle passes thru. That being said, I agree with other posters that a self-adhesive velcro tab may be a faster and "cleaner" method for a duct tape closure. If you use isopropyl alcohol for a prolonged time, use protective gloves and a well ventilated location for your project.
I have a duct tape purse/messanger bag, my daughter made. I am trying to put a velcro closer on it.
Wet the needle before you sew.
Why do you need to sew tape, it is super sticky.
Keep the tape cold? Thats a good question :) Is the duct tape stuck to anything, or just other duct tape? Duct tape relies on a rubber-cement type adhesive. Goof-off should clean the needle occasionally.

i made the usual biscuit base with 8 digestive biscuit (120g) crushed to sandy texture in a ziploc bag, then added 60g melted butter & pressed the “wet sand’ mixture in a 8” (20cm) spring-form cake tin line with parchment paper. then placed it in the fridge.

Since the loss of my dog Moya, I have been rather sensitive on the issue of loose animals. I have seen dogs loose and running around. If they are in front of a house..I just think they belong there but getting some exercise.
It was around the Holidays last year. I was helping my Parents to go through the Christmas decorations and put some up. I noticed this medium size dog running around the houses. It had a collar and I had never seen this dog before so I tried to get near it. It barked at me and ran a ways a away. Then turned and barked again. I kept trying to get near it and keep it from the road. It ran, turned and barked. This went on for a bit. I finally went back to the decorations. At one point something fell and that dog had been laying at the corner of the house. It jumped up and barked. Then ran off along the ditch toward the road at the back of the house. I never saw the dog again. I don’t know if he made it to the other side road to the wooded area. Or if he circled about along the road to get home. Or if really bad things happened to him. I still worry.

A couple weeks ago, Peaches — our sweet orange tabby — went missing. She was the friendliest of our barn carts, always nearby, always first to greet us, always curious and following our every step around the farm.
Just before she disappeared, she started getting a bit aloof — she wasn’t making her frequent appearances. She might have been pregnant and ready to nest. We were hoping for a litter (which was why we didn’t neuter one of the male barn cats).
Some cats will go off and hide when they’re ready to birth. We suspect this is what Peaches did. Problem is, if you leave our gated farm, you will be in fox territory. The three-legged fox has made it clear that she’s in possession of the land behind ours. The fox has, on occasion, sat beyond our fence and peered in at us. Not taunting, exactly; more like musing, maybe even longing.
Very worried, Jill and I decided to make a search of the hinterland one sunny Saturday morning.

Kaitlyn Dunnett here, to talk about the ninth Liss MacCrimmon mystery, The Scottie Barked at Midnight. In some ways, it was a challenge to write this one.
Dilemma: how to add dogs to a series that already has two cats?
Solution: keep them (mostly) separated.
In The Scottie Barked at Midnight, on a cold and bleak March evening, Liss MacCrimmon is driving home from a shopping spree at the outlets in Freeport, Maine when something darts in front of her car. Afraid that she's hit a dog or a cat, she stops to look for the animal. What she finds, mercifully uninjured, is a lost and shivering Scottish terrier. She takes the little dog, a female, to the nearest vet and then agrees to keep her until the owner is found.
She did not consult her two cats, Lumpkin and Glenora. Needless to say, neither is thrilled to have a house guest. Fortunately, the Scottie, Dandy by name, is soon claimed. Not so fortunately, Dandy was running loose because she was dognapped, and returning her to her owner leads to Liss's involvement in yet another murder.
Lumpkin and Glenora were on the cover of an earlier adventure, Scotched. For The Scottie Barked at Midnight, it is Dandy in the cover illustration. In fact, there are two Scotties in the story, Dandy and Dondi, two-thirds of an act called "Deidre and her Dancing Doggies" that is primed to win the top prize on a television variety show . . . until someone does in Deidre.

NB: Space-wise, you really need two whiteboards for this. If you don’t have that luxury, then you can stick A4 papers around the room, one for each student + 1 for the teacher.
Give each student a marker pen as they arrive to class.
Ask them to find a space on the whiteboard and draw a square for themselves. The square should be big enough to draw a picture inside.
Tell them to write their name above the square and then to draw a picture / some pictures that represent something that they did or saw at the weekend.
Give them time to draw and inform late-comers what to do as they arrive.
The teacher should also draw his / her weekend picture.

Being the only black kid in a class full of white faces is not fun, especially during Black History Month. In a new video, YouTube personality Akilah Hughes highlights the five stages black students go through in February when they have to celebrate black history around people who don't share their racial background.
"Can you believe that your entirely white class just turned to stare at you because your teacher brought up Harriet Tubman?" Hughes asked, introducing the first stage: denial. Not to mention your classmates asking why there isn't a white history month. This can't be real life.
The other stages include: anger over historical black achievements being reduced to only a few events, bargaining with God that you'll complain less if John just stops comparing the slave trade to the Holocaust and facing a slightly depressing state of victim-blaming your own race.
But these feelings are only temporary.
The last --and probably realest -- stage is the silver lining in all of this intolerance. It's accepting that some people are just the worst, but that shouldn't stop you from celebrating your race.
"And hey, Beyoncé said it best," Hughes said. "You're gonna learn to love your baby hairs and Jackson 5 nostrils so celebrate Black History Month."
Now dust your shoulders off and get in "Formation!"

One teacher at the college told of one student who offered other students $300 to drop out of a class, so he could get the final credit he needed.
This excerpt reminded me of my first day of Introductory Spanish at Montana State University. That quarter, there was excess demand for slots in introductory Spanish, so not everyone who wanted to take the class could take it. One student needed the class to graduate, but did not register in time. His attempted solution: just after the professor handed out the syllabus, the student interrupted the class, saying "I will pay anyone here $500 to drop the class right now, so I can add it. I need this class to graduate." No one in the class took him up on the offer. After he left, the professor turned to us and said, "I guess everyone wants to be here."

But a student-teacher relationship is a two way street. Teachers can do a lot to set the tone in the classroom, but students have to do their fair share, as well. If you're a student, here are a few things you should know about how to build a good student-teacher relationship.
Don't mistake the relationship for something else. There can be a great deal of affection and admiration in the student-teacher relationship, and it can go both ways. As a student, you have to remember that the teacher can be a mentor, and maybe someday a friend, but is not your mom or dad, your potential girlfriend or boyfriend, or your big brother or sister, or that bully that beat you up in the 4th grade. You don't need the teacher's approval of your personal life, and your teacher isn't responsible for the bad things that happen to you.

Did a bird drop something?) But as insecure teens are wont to do, I began to think that it was because I was ugly, since my clothes and hair were clean and presentable.
It turned out (as we got to know each other, they told me) that the stares WERE because of my clothes and hair, which I wore in very conservative styles. So conservative, that my aunt and one of my grandmothers used to say I looked like an old lady or if they were being kind, an old-fashioned lady or a prairie girl.

"I knew this guy was walking past and staring at me," he says. "I had been getting that sort of attention for weeks -- and of course the past 21-odd years as well -- but took the photo kind of on a reflex, not thinking about it," Connolly says. "Finding the picture to be really aesthetically pleasing kind of made me pursue the project a bit more."
Connolly began traveling around the world, taking photographs of people looking at him. The stare turned out to be universal, but people in each place had different ideas about why he has no legs. Connolly was seen as a beggar in Vienna, a victim of thalidomide in New Zealand, a holy man in Ukraine, a victim of the Balkan war in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina,

Police explain what actually happened. "One of his roommates goes to the same store purchases the same ticket, later alters his losing ticket to match the winning ticket," Chris Polen with the Vacaville Police Department.
Police say the roommate swapped the altered ticket for the real one.
They arrested the suspected thief when he tried to cash in the real winning ticket.

Now the man is contemplating what he will do with all that money, which is the third largest Big Wednesday jackpot ever won.

Gele can be rather large and flamboyant and is worn for various occasions ranging from simple day-to-day activities to more elaborate ceremonies.

It is typically accompanied by traditional African attire that may or may not have the same pattern as the head tie itself.

From buzzing to hissing, that ringing sensation in your ear could be serious, especially if you experience it often. Over 350,000 Canadians have some form of ear ringing throughout adulthood. Almost all chronic ringing of the ears is a condition known as tinnitus.
Tinnitus can be described as buzzing, roaring, ringing or hissing in the ears. It may occur in one or both ears and may affect people of all ages, but is more common in adults. The ringing sensation can be intermittent or constant, and is annoying and bothersome at times.
What does the ringing mean?
When your ears are exposed to loud noise for a period of time, ringing may ensue. People who like their music loud while driving or those who work in noisy factories may experience ear ringing. Keeping the volume low when listening to music, especially when wearing ear buds or headphones can help protect your ears.
Another reason your ears may ring is due to a natural buildup of earwax. When there is blockage in the ear canal, you may hear sounds that really are not there. Ask your doctor for a quick check-up to see if you could benefit from an ear cleaning.
People who have too much pressure on them often experience ear ringing. For those dealing with emotional stress, you may need to see your doctor right away. While stress may not be the cause of tinnitus, it is a major contributor. There may be other problems going on with your heart,

I have been able to pop my right ear once and it helped with my hearing. I have had random periods of runny nose or stuffed up. Does anyone have any suggestions on what could be causing this? I have been to an ENT who did an MRI and basically told me he has no clue why my hearing went down. I have been on prednisone for two weeks with no change in my symptoms. Any help is appreciated!
Hello again ShellBell, I've replied to your comment regarding Tinnitus. I'm so sorry you've joined the club with us all who suffer Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD).
It's sounds to me as though you have allergies, again the same as me. Try taking a daily Antihistamine (Citrizine) to see if they help. Strange how the Prednisolone haven't helped to get rid of the mucus that's obviously blocking your tubes. When it's prescribed for me I'm given a 20 reducing course which unblocks my left ear and clears up all the inflammation too.....maybe the course you were given wasn't long

Tired of all of the grossly inflamed sales pitches? Need some honesty?
Here is my Tinnitus Miracle story so you can make your own educated decision about The Tinnitus Miracle by Lisa Olson.
I started a blog in December 2008, mostly due to my oldest child Steven convincing me that blogging was cool. I decided that it would be a good idea just to write down the things that happen, just because I’ve been having so much trouble hearing and being bothered by constant ringing, whoosing, and waves in my brain. If you were feeling the way that I was, you would need some sort of release.
About five years ago, I started having problems with my hearing. My first doctor talked to me about Tinnitus, and told me that my employment as a construction worker was severely hurting my hearing. Of course, this made perfect sense, but I wore the best hearing protection that our company could buy. Still, I took his advice and sought a different position with our company. I gave up my passion for woodworking and machining to become a desk jockey. Sure, I hated it, but I thought that it would stop the nagging whooshing sounds that would happen from time to time. Could my hearing be already on its way out at 27 years of age? It couldn’t be! It was time to get a second opinion.

This ringing is often temporary in nature and will go away on its own. But if you experience ringing in the ears on the regular and it doesn’t seem to improve no matter what you do, then it could take a negative toll on your quality of life.
Chronic ringing in the ears could be a result of tinnitus, where a person hears sound regardless of an external sound source. Having tinnitus can affect a person’s daily activities and sleep.
Although there is no cure for tinnitus, it can be managed.
About one in five people will experience the perception of noise, which can sound like ringing, buzzing, whistling, or cracking. Around 90 percent of tinnitus patients also have some level of hearing loss. This makes doctors suspect that hearing loss may play a role in tinnitus.
When we are exposed to loud noises, it can damage the tiny hairs in the ears which help us hear. It is theorized that damage to these small hairs plays a role in tinnitus.
Some management remedies for tinnitus include using a hearing aid, using a sound generator, or tinnitus retraining therapy.
If ringing in the ears is causing challenges in your daily life, your first step is to undergo a hearing test. From there, you can work with your doctor to find treatment options that best suit your daily life.

I always considered myself pretty lucky. My baby would eat anything and everything. Getting enough vegetables into her diet wasn’t an issue. Then one day (seemingly overnight) all that changed. My daughter was now an independent toddler and she had her own ideas about what she wanted to eat and even more ideas about what she didn’t. The only thing I could count on her wanting to eat was cheese.
Okay kiddo, we get it….you like dairy, but one cannot live on cheese alone. What about vegetables for heaven’s sake???
I tried all different varieties and prepared them in just about every way under the sun and yet she refused to even put them to her lips. I was about to throw in the towel when I thought of one more idea to try. Below I am sharing with you my own idea, as well as a couple others from friends. Hopefully between the 3, you will find something that works for you and your kid(s)!

As parents of a smiley, yet very particular baby girl, we are so grateful for the teachers, assistant director and director at WCC - Cedar Creek. Our daughter is small for her age and there was concern over her slow weight gain for the first 6 months of her life. She is very sensitive to who is feeding her, how she is being held, and the temperature of the breast milk. WCC staff have done everything possible to ensure our daughter takes in as much as possible. If she refused her bottle, they would try a different position, a different teacher, etc. It was so comforting as a worried parent, to see how much WCC cared and the lengths they would go to in an effort to help our daughter eat.

Many are going as far as refusing to eat foods that aren't white or are only eating chips, toast or fried food every meal of the day.
Childhood nutritionists are saying they are seeing a spike in the number of frustrated parents and children attending their clinics in a desperate bid to solve the anti-vegetable crisis.
It's the worst they have ever seen it and backs up Australian Bureau of Statistics data that shows only 5 per cent of Australian kids are getting their daily recommended intake of vegetables.
While fruit consumption is on the rise, vegetable consumption has fallen.
Just 5.4 per cent of 2-18-year-olds were meeting the minimum five serves of vegetables a day in 2014-15.
This was down from 5.7 per cent in 2007 and one in four Aussie kids is now considered overweight or obese with childhood obesity on the rise.
Paediatric dietitian and founder of Child Nutrition Miriam Raleigh said "parents are tearing their hair out" over their kids' aversions to vegetables.

Now, that little girl didn’t like not liking vegetables. It bothered her that others were enjoying something that she could not. She felt left out…like she was missing some big secret. She especially felt left out in the fall, when her parents and sisters happily ate their roasted acorn squash. They really, really liked the green and golden treat. But try as she might, the little redhead really, really did not.
Years passed. Bit by bit, the little redhead came to love her broccoli and cauliflower and kale with a passion that was quite indecent. The girl who once turned up her nose at anything green (save, oddly enough for lima beans), now thought that roasted brussels sprouts were comfort food. She grew bushels of tomatoes, chard, peppers, and more in her garden. And her vegetable drawers in her fridge were always stocked to overflowing. She was, decidedly, an odd duck.
By the time the redheaded girl had grown into a woman, there were only three vegetables she did not like: beets, spaghetti squash, and acorn squash. She knew there was nothing to be done about the beets or the spaghetti squash. They were horrid things, surely not meant for human consumption. But acorn squash…that gave her pause.

Questions › Category: Feeding Children › My 5 yr old won’t eat fresh fruit, I keep trying different times during and between meals but its a firm no!
It’s really common for young children to refuse to eat certain foods and fruit and vegetables are often top of the list of disliked, or rejected, foods.
In relation to fruit, many children nowadays will eat fruit pouches or pots of fruit but won’t eat fruit in its raw form. In order to increase your child’s willingness to eat fruit, you need to keep offering fruits to her at meal and snack times. Do this over a period of time (weeks and months) and try to offer the fruits in different ways, for example, some of us love tinned peaches (in natural juice) but are less keen on fresh peaches with their skin on. This process of exposure – or repeated offering – can take time, so keep at it but never force or pressure her to eat a food. However, gentle encouragement to pick up, smell, lick or try a food can all help children to be more willing to eat it.
The Child Feeding Guide has developed a free ‘exposure monitor’ to help caregivers keep track of how many times they’ve offered a food and whether it was eaten or refused. If you might find this helpful, you can access it here. There are also lots of other

It is absolutely a multi-purpose glove which has a wide application in variety of industries. String knit glove has a big advantage other types of work gloves are not comparable with, that is breathable. Compared with canvas and leather glove, it is more ambidextrous. Another reason that makes it popular may be the low price, so sometimes it is only for one time use. Even though it is cheap, some suppliers manage to make it cheaper further by cutting various cost. Now lets take a look at what a cheaper string knit glove looks like. Those are the aspects from which suppliers cut their cost.
Different types of yarns have different prices. For the same type of yarn used in gloves, there are typically multiple qualities that are available. Cheaper string knit glove uses lower quality yarns that is one of import ant ways to cut cost. Basically, you can find the difference between a higher quality and a low quality yarn just from the outside look. Gloves with recycle yarns do not look clean and pure, but even under recycle yarn category, the quality is variable with different prices. When you buy this type of glove, you had better make a comparison to see the real quality of the yarn used.

Retrieved Text: What factors can deteriorate work gloves?
Answered by Alex Marks, director of hand protection, North Safety Products, Cranston, RI.
All elastomers degrade over a period of time. The rate at which this degradation takes place is determined by many factors, some of which are controlled by the manufacturer and others by the user.
Different types of elastomers have different aging characteristics. This is determined by the chemical structure of the polymer and anti-degrading additives. Natural rubber is very flexible and strong, making it ideal for hand protection, but has poor aging properties compared with other elastomers. Hypalon has good resistance to ozone, a reactive form of oxygen, but only fair heat resistance. There are always trade-offs regarding glove materials. End users should work with the manufacturer to find the best combination of properties for a particular situation.
Storage conditions are controlled by the user and play an important part in determining the useable life span of a glove. Before using new gloves, leave them in their original shipping box. Gloves should be kept flat without excessive folds or creases. During use, gloves easily can withstand stretching and bending for short periods; however, a sharp fold at the same spot for months will cause weakening and cracks on the surface.
Several preventable factors can cause noticeable damage to gloves. Ozone causes small cuts in the surface of rubber products. When humidity is low and temperatures are high, rubber parts are put under physical stress. Good ventilation and removing sources of ozone are key to preventing this problem.
Ultraviolet light also accelerates the degradation

Disposable gloves are thin gloves that are typically made from latex, polyethylene or nitrile. They are available in one size and stretch easily to fit large or small hands. They are the same types of gloves that are worn by those in the medical professions. Though not sterile, latex gloves are available at most stores in the paint section. They are convenient for quick cleaning jobs. For acidic, harsher cleaning products, ensure the gloves are thick enough that they can withstand the product. In these cases, cleaning gloves may be a better choice.
These gloves are often made of a thicker latex or rubber and are textured on the fingers and/or palms for additional grip. Much longer than regular gloves, they typically reach up to the elbows to offer maximum protection. They range in price and cost between $2 – $10 and are available wherever cleaning supplies are sold with additional options online.
For those of you who want to avoid the harsh chemicals and their dangers altogether, there are gloves available from Enjo that remove the need for chemicals. These gloves have been tested by some of the top consumer panels and found to be effective in cleaning without chemicals. They are made from a special microfiber composition that only requires water to work.

Have you ever put a hot, spicy pepper into your mouth on a wild whim and then suddenly realize that “Argh! This is too hot!” Of course this shouldn’t happen with the jalapeño, but it can happen with some of the other, hotter varieties of chiles, like the habanero.
One bit of advice: Don’t Drink The Water! Pure capsaicin is soluble in alcohol but not soluble in cold water. Hence, instead of dousing the raging flame on your tongue, the water will only spread the spices around in your mouth and make the situation worse. Instead, try sugar or milk to curb that luscious heat (if you can’t take it, that is). Dairy products contain a chemical called casein that deters capsaicin, the chemical that makes jalapeno peppers hot.
After time, you can build up a tolerance to the heat by continuing to eat hot peppers in small doses, but you’ll always have the initial burst of spicy flavor with our friend, the jalapeño.
Additionally, when handling chile peppers, you should always wear rubber gloves to avoid contact with the pepper oils. The oils can cause a burning sensation on the skin. In a pinch you can use the yellow rubber gloves that many people use while washing dishes, but thin latex gloves work wonderfully for maneuverability. It’s really a lot easier to cut and handle the peppers with these types of gloves.

Of the things I had to consider and think about regarding Bennett's recent hospitalization, one of the things that came into sharp focus for me on Friday was Oliver's role as the brother of the sick child.
Seriously. What a difficult place to be in. Your family life resolves around the sick kid, which can feel unfair. But then, if you start to verbalize your feeling like it's unfair, others can fault your behavior as being selfish and unsympathetic to the sick child. I imagine, for a well kid, these situations could feel like a lose-lose situation. You don't really want to be sick...but there is also something pretty disappointing about being the one who is well.
During this last hospitalization, I tried to balance Oliver's need for normalcy and his need to be informed. The first day, I sent him to school and hoped he would have no real understanding of what was going on with his brother or his mom and dad that day. But on the second day, after a visit to see his brother, it was clear that sending him to school would have not been the best choice. It might have felt to him like we were sending him away.
