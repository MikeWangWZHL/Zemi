"AMOR" PALABRA TAN CORTITA PERO PODEROSA COMO LA ENERGIA ATOMICA.
PERO TAN MAL USADA COMO MAL INTERPRETADA, DESDE HACE YA VARIOS SIGLOS POR LA HUMANIDAD.
"POR LOS FRUTOS SE CONOCE AL ARBOL", Y A HOY LOS FRUTOS DEL ARBOL DE LA HUMANIDAD NOS MUESTRAN GRAN CARENCIA DE AMOR, DEL VERDADERO AMOR CON MAYUSCULA !!
¿ SE YO MISMO AMAR?
¿CUAL ES MI CONCEPTO DEL AMOR?
¿COMO VIVO Y REFLEJO EL AMOR?
*EL HOMBRE ES CREADO POR DIOS, LO CREA A SU IMAGEN Y SEMEJANZA Y LE CREA TODO UN UNIVERSO, UN MUNDO A SU ALREDEDOR. ES DECIR, QUE DIOS HACE DEL HOMBRE COMO UN "PRODUCTO DERIVADO" DE SI MISMO Y DESDE EL PRIMER INSTANTE, LE REGALA EL MUNDO QUE ACABA DE CREAR Y LO HACE VIVIR EN EL "PARAISO TERRENAL" O JARDIN DEL EDEN.
SU DESEO ERA QUE SU CREATURA FUERA FELIZ: LO CREA POR AMOR PARA QUE SEA FELIZ.
CREA A LA MUJER UN POCO MAS TARDE, PARA COMPLETAR ESA FELICIDAD, PARA QUE NO ESTUVIERA SOLO. LA PRIMERA ORDENQUE LES DA A AMBOS ES "CRECED Y MULTIPLICAOS, HENCHID Y DOMINAD LA TIERRA". ES DECIR, LES ORDENA CONOCER UNA FAZ PERFECTA DEL AMOR, QUE ES LA DE DAR DE VIDA POR AMOR., SER CREADORES, PARTICIPAR DE LA CREACION DIVINA POR AMOR.
AL POCO TIEMPO, EL MAL SE HACE PRESENTE, Y HACE JUGAR A LA SOBERBIA SU MEJOR PAPEL. LA SOBERBIA QUE ES LA ANTITESIS DEL AMOR, HACE PERDER AL HOMBRE Y LA MUJER SU CAPACIDAD DE AMAR PLENAMENTE Y CON PERFECCION DIVINA.

The blessing and the curse of the web is that everything is measurable. For reporters working in newsrooms that measure the traffic of articles on a minute-to-minute basis, it can be discouraging to see fluff trump substance.
In some newsrooms, reporters are competing for raises and bonuses based on the traffic to their stories. Editors encourage the practice, because they too have their compensation tied to traffic numbers.
It´s easy to get lots of page views with a gossipy piece about a celebrity, but is the site serving its community and adhering to its editorial standards by chasing the numbers?
That is the million-dollar question for journalists working in the digital world.
To illustrate the value of loyalty over volume, I´m going to use some graphics from the website of the Digital Journalism Center, whose articles are published in Spanish and whose audience is Latin American journalists interested in training opportunities.
The chart below depicts the loyalty of the 15,000 unique visitors to the Digital Journalism Center´s website in the past year, using the Google Analytics tool.
Our site is typical of websites in terms of loyalty: two-thirds of the visitors came to the site only once during the year. Ten percent came only twice.
I urge you to look at the loyalty numbers of your own site using Analytics or some other tool. You will see a graphic that follows this same pattern: the majority of your visitors are casual, infrequent. They probably find you through search engines or some other reference.

We begin the book with the phrase “knowledge is power” because all of our shared tasks as women to better our health begin with what we know and learn from each other. If we have access to education and information about our health, there is much we can do to improve the basic conditions necessary for our families and communities to thrive. To know is to have the power to learn and change, the power to disagree, to explore and to enjoy. To know is to have the power to be free and independent and also the power to love and support the well-being of those around us; in sum, to know is to be a woman, fully empowered.
In the first section of this book we present a vision of good health as well-being in all of life’s dimensions. We emphasize the importance of joining with other women in order to create a more just world that supports the well-being of all. We also explain that the medical system must be used with care, recognizing that our good health doesn’t start with the medical establishment but from the quality of our lives and relationships. The education and information offered by books are just some of the indispensable tools for a more just world. We also need the support of other women who validate our experiences,

Delve into some real to speculative examples below.
Practice Time–This Zero Audience is usually when the storyteller is practicing. These practices are more effective when having other people to listen and to mentor. Sometimes, have other people listen is not an option and an artist has to make due. Though how does it count when the storyteller performs in front of a mirror?
Performance Time–Technically, there would never be zero for if a storyteller tells to oneself, then the storyteller happens to play the role of performer and of listener.
Practice Time–This One-Audience Member occurs when one person is listening to a storyteller. This kind of practice is preferred in-person though telephone and the computer provide ways for people to connect and to critique each other. Choose someone who is a great listener. Then show the same respect and skills and be a great listener back.

The latter book has a prologue written by Enrique Vila Matas of Barcelona. Both titles confirm the position of the author of Domar a la divina Garza (Taming the Divine Heron) as one of the great voices in contemporary Spanish narrative.
In the following conversation, the writer confesses his doubts in this way: “It’s possible that my novelistic ability has dried up.” Nevertheless, with the appearance this year of those two titles it becomes obvious that the productive link between life and work—so explored by Pitol— continues to nourish the wakefulness, the dreams and the insomnia of his vivid creative imagination, which now has received the most prestigious recognition which our language can bestow on its authors: the 2005 Cervantes Prize.
Sergio Pitol is the author of Tiempo cercado (Corraled Time) (1959), Infierno de todos (Inferno for All) (1965),Los climas (The Climates) (1966), No hay tal lugar (There is no Such Place) (1967), Del encuentro nupcial (About the Nuptial Encounter) (1970); the novels: El tañido de una flauta (The Sound of a Flute) (1972), Juegos florales (Flower Games) (1982), El desfile del amor (The Parade of Love) (1984), and the essay collections: El arte de la fuga (The Art of Escape) (1996), Soñar la realidad (Dreaming Reality) (1998), Pasión por la trama (Passion for the Plot) (1999), El viaje (The Trip) (2001).

Retrieved Text: This new work by Nicholas Arroyave-Portela is like an epic poem where the raw material is clay instead of words, clay that is sensuous and alive, modelled and moulded, pressed, marked, stretched, cut and smoothed. Embedded within these clay forms are images, myths and metaphors that interweave with one another so that everyone will be able to find details - shapes, textures, juxtapositions - to trigger memories and stimulate ideas. They hover on the borderlines between categories, between abstraction and representation, between the fine and applied arts, and they need to be considered from different perspectives and understood on different levels. They are in some ways private and personal, in other ways universal. They engage with ideas of time and space, history and geography, with life, love, journeys and genealogies, with what it is to be human in a changing world.
In a year when there have been serious earthquakes in Haiti, Chile and China, and when, at the time of writing, the European skies remain empty of planes because of a volcanic eruption in Iceland, it is peculiarly appropriate that a central theme in this work is geology. The layers of clay present us with a primeval world of geological strata, earth movements, shifting tectonic plates and volcanic eruptions. The subtle colours of the thick slips suggest the blending of geological layers over time to create the graded tones of desert sands and mudflats, while the ribbed and rippled surfaces are like the work of water and ice on hills and continents.

Por ello se suele circunscribir la moral al conjunto de valoraciones y elecciones en términos de bien y mal (que lleven aparejadas la etiqueta “bueno” y “malo”) en el ámbito de las relaciones y comportamientos sociales, y con un horizonte temporal amplio (al menos para las consecuencias de los actos).
Así, decisiones de vida o muerte, salud y enfermedad, colaboración y explotación, ayuda, indiferencia o perjuicio, fidelidad o traición...etc etc...son morales en sentido estricto.

Retrieved Text: Tecate, Baja California born Mexican singer Carla Patricia Morrison Flores, better known professionally as Carla Morrison, proved this past Thursday when she performed at the Observatory in Santa Ana that when it comes to a person's creative identity two ethnicities are better than one. Although she sang songs mostly in Spanish that melded her unique Mexican-American family history into this music, she freely acknowledges in an accent free English that a great deal of her creativity has its roots in the music of Patsy Cline and Brits like Morrissey and Radiohead.
Because her band got held up on some technicality at immigration, the audience at the Observatory was treated to a solo and intimate mix of Morrison's music, her views on life, and how specifically a woman's appearance has often been used to value them as something less than who they really are. With a predominant audience of chicanos who quietly sang along lip-syncing every song she sang, it was clear that this message was not lost on them.
Morrison clearly expresses with her music a vibrant and new Mexican-American identity- whether documented or undocumented- that refuses to choose between what it finds valuable and worth preserving in either culture, while taking it to the next step by synthesizing in her music what was at the Observator a fresh new expression for both American and Mexican music.
But more than this, Morrison is singing an anthem for a young new majority of bi-cultural Spanish and English speaking youth who at the very least see two as better than one,

Let me try to address a few of the concerns raised in the thread and explain our thinking.
First off, why this wacky raidwide effect? Why not a traditional legendary that is purely individual? The idea’s origins lie in what this particular legendary is: a ring. It’s not a weapon designed to strike foes, or a shield to protect you from harm. And what is the nature of a ring? Whether we’re talking about seven rings for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, about Captain Planet, or about common social covenants in our own societies, rings tend to be paired with counterparts, and to have their meaning derived from the connections entailed therein. A lot of fluff, perhaps, but that’s what got us thinking along the lines of a group effect rather than a personal one. This certainly isn’t a template for all future legendaries, but we find it very fitting for this particular one.

¡HAY MISA DE SOLIDARIDAD EN EL BARRIO ESTE SEMANA!
Sunday Reflection: What Do I Have to Do?
The gospel text for this Sunday is from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 10:17-30. Like last week’s passage that began with a question, so too this week’s passage: “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” This question provides the framework for this week’s reflection.
Jesus responded with a Torah lesson by asking another question: “Why do you call me good?” Jesus asked that question because, according to the Torah, only God is good. The foundational belief in Judaism is that God is. This central teaching is captured in daily prayer, the Schema. “Hear, Israel: the LORD is our God, the LORD is one.” This means that God alone is that to which we offer praise. Thus, to say, “Good teacher,” or “Good rabbi,” is not acceptable. By steering the man back toward God and away from himself, Jesus continued by underscoring the commandments. The man responded that he had been “observing” these commandments all his life.
The man was focused on getting or obtaining eternal life and apparently observing the commandments — that which was required of him by his own religious system — was not enough. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are lacking in one thing. Go, sell what you have, and give to [the] poor and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” By looking Jesus

Delve into some real to speculative examples below.
Practice Time–This Zero Audience is usually when the storyteller is practicing. These practices are more effective when having other people to listen and to mentor. Sometimes, have other people listen is not an option and an artist has to make due. Though how does it count when the storyteller performs in front of a mirror?
Performance Time–Technically, there would never be zero for if a storyteller tells to oneself, then the storyteller happens to play the role of performer and of listener.
Practice Time–This One-Audience Member occurs when one person is listening to a storyteller. This kind of practice is preferred in-person though telephone and the computer provide ways for people to connect and to critique each other. Choose someone who is a great listener.

I discovered the nature of exploitation hidden inside the commercial relationships. The investor gives a certain amount of money to buy a labor force, and pressures the workers to work more hours than usual, many times paying them even less than the minimum wage. Nobody is really indispensable in a country of over one billion inhabitants. As a consequence of excessive labor hours, families are becoming more isolated, where the "only child" grows up without the appropriate care from his parents. This unlimited thirst for profits goes beyond values, and what is worse, the Chinese are destroying the ecosystem in which their future generations will live. More and more Chinese people are adopting our Western culture, forgetting their ancestral heritage and methodologies. They dream of buying new cars and wearing foreign clothing brands; now they not only produce these products, they want to buy them too. The illusion of progress is changing their "Long life" for a lifestyle that is short, solitary, unhealthy and stressful.

When we fight, when we ostracize, when we try to tear each other down, when we rejoice at the failures of another, the Devil is right there, cheering us on. Sometimes our disagreements are legitimate. Sometimes both sides have a point. But the Devil works to ensure that every argument becomes an all-out war, and that every difficult moment results in anger, self-righteousness, and years and years of unforgiveness. It is the Devil that makes us believe that communities are not stronger than conflict and that love does not allow for disagreement.
One of the Devil’s most powerful tools is the idea of the zero-sum game, that is, the idea that for me to win, you must lose. This is why Saint James says that “where jealously and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every foul practice.” When we value ourselves above others and believe that others must lose for us to win, we play the Devil’s game, destroying lives and reputations in order to make ourselves look good by comparison. If someone else is wealthy or popular or happy, our jealously makes us want to be them. But more than that, it also makes us want them to be us, so that they can experience our poverty, obscurity, or unhappiness. We want to be elevated and them to be humbled. A zero-sum game.

The blessing and the curse of the web is that everything is measurable. For reporters working in newsrooms that measure the traffic of articles on a minute-to-minute basis, it can be discouraging to see fluff trump substance.
In some newsrooms, reporters are competing for raises and bonuses based on the traffic to their stories. Editors encourage the practice, because they too have their compensation tied to traffic numbers.
It´s easy to get lots of page views with a gossipy piece about a celebrity, but is the site serving its community and adhering to its editorial standards by chasing the numbers?
That is the million-dollar question for journalists working in the digital world.
To illustrate the value of loyalty over volume, I´m going to use some graphics from the website of the Digital Journalism Center, whose articles are published in Spanish and whose audience is Latin American journalists interested in training opportunities.
The chart below depicts the loyalty of the 15,000 unique visitors to the Digital Journalism Center´s website in the past year, using the Google Analytics tool.
Our site is typical of websites in terms of loyalty: two-thirds of the visitors came to the site only once during the year. Ten percent came only twice.

Many years ago the US Embassy in El Salvador called and asked if we’d like to come there with one of our Spanish-language shows. We were thrilled. That phone call was the beginning of a life-changing relationship for me with El Salvador. Since then we have had the honor of working there four times, three of those trips being at the invitation of the US State Department’s Cultural Envoy program. We have taught theatre workshops for kids and adults and teachers, performed at orphanages, held roundtables with local theatre artists, worked with El Salvador’s youth symphony, done many press interviews and public events, and performed shows at the beautiful Teatro Luis Poma in San Salvador. Deb, Chima and I have made dear lifelong friends there. And on every one of our four trips to Central America, I have had deeply personal conversations with my Salvadoran friends about their politics, economics, crime, international relations, the history of the civil war there, and the U.S.’s role in El Salvador during the war and now.

“LOS PRIMEROS SERÁN LOS ÚLTIMOS Y LOS ÚLTIMOS SERÁN LOS PRIMEROS”.
PARA FORTUNA DEL CIELO Y DE LA TIERRA, NO TODOS LOS PRIMEROS SERÁN LOS ÚLTIMOS. ES CIERTO, CERTÍSIMO QUE ES DIFÍCIL PERMANECER PRIMEROS E INCORRUPTIBLES, PERO TAMBIÉN ES CIERTO QUE ES POSIBLE, SI SE ES CAPAZ DE SUPERAR LAS TENTACIONES QUE TRATAN DE DISUADIR, QUE TRATAN DE EMBRIDAR Y ENREDAR LOS REALES VALORES QUE SE HAN ACUMULADO EN LA CONCIENCIA.
SER LIBRES, LIBRES DE VERDAD, NO ES UNA TAREA FÁCIL NI ESTÁ EXENTA DE RENUNCIAS; TAMPOCO ES POSIBLE SER LIBRE, SI NO SE ESTÁ LIBERADO DE LAS ESCORIAS QUE INFECTAN Y MOLESTAN A LA PARTE MEJOR DEL “YO”.
PERMANECER “PRIMEROS” ES UN PRIVILEGIO QUE SE GANA CON MUCHA FATIGA Y CON MUCHO ESFUERZO. ES FÁCIL SOLTAR LAS MANOS DEL ARADO, CUANDO SE MIRA LA GRAN EXTENSIÓN DE TIERRA QUE HAY QUE ARAR, Y, ASIMISMO ES FÁCIL ECHARSE ATRÁS, POR TEMOR A NO PODER REPOSAR. ESTO ES COMPRENSIBLE, HUMANAMENTE COMPRENSIBLE.
SIN EMBARGO HAY QUIEN SABE QUE TIENE QUE HACERLO, PORQUE ES CONSCIENTE DEL PENOSO TRABAJO QUE LE ES CONFIADO, CON ÁNIMO Y CON VALOR SE PONE Y TRABAJA Y DOBLA LA ESPALDA EN HONOR A QUIEN LE HA HECHO DIGNO DE SERVIR A UNA JUSTA CAUSA.
ES UNA ELECCIÓN Y NO UNA IMPOSICIÓN.

“Let us go over to the other side”.
We are in this boat which we call the Church and we are also in this boat that we call the world. Jesus invites the Church and the world to go over to the other side.
One of the temptations that often is present in our lives and in the lives of our communities is inactivity. We love to have our points of view and often get comfortable with our habits without realizing that we all need to go over to the other side.
Going over to the other side means accepting a change in one’s habits. Deciding to look for new ways to improve our relationship with God, with ourselves, and with others.
On the other side, God is awaiting us, and in order to meet him we must accept facing difficulties, the storms that come on our way over.
We are all on this boat which is the Church and this boat needs to go forward to get to the other side. We are all responsible for the movement and speed of changes in the Church and in the world. Each person has a responsibility in the boat where we are.
We should not get comfortable in our complacency, in our principles and in our convictions. Let us agree to let ourselves be rocked by the Word of God so that we can go over to the other side. Let us press on to meet God on this boat which should

Emitting 4,611 million tonnes of CO2-e, Europe ranks as the third-biggest GHG emitter in the world (European Commission, 2015).
Why not try to change the world?
We are four friends, studying Agricultural Engineering, and strongly bound by the same drive to establish our project that will redefine the meaning of agriculture in such a way that it will inspire youth to get active in the sector! We want to develop self-sustaining agroecological food production systems in the vicinity of our beloved city: Madrid.
Agroecological food production systems aim to reduce their impact on the environment rather than focussing on mainly yield.
These systems have a reduced GHG emission and higher biodiversity, on the one hand, and on the other hand, a higher resilience against climate change and other natural impacts compared to conventional systems. They also deal with pests, diseases and soil degradation problems in a more natural way.
Talking about making agriculture sustainable: these agroecosystems are key to take into account. In our project we want to bridge the gap between agriculture and city life and bring these worlds—that are now so far apart—more closely together.
We will do this by creating a two-way interaction between these two worlds: first, the food produced by the agroecosystems will supply families in Madrid, but these families won’t only consume this food. No, they will go back to the field where it has been

In short, it is an initiative by the UNICEF Social and Civic Media team which promotes youth digital engagement with location based civic and social media, empowering them to become public advocates and decision makers for the future of their community.
How does it work? UNICEF Country Offices, in partnership with local NGOs all over the world, train adolescents and young people to gather data and stories about the community they live in. They generate reports about different aspects of their community, like the exact location of public services, social spaces, socio environmental risks and hazards in general. The information is then verified by UNICEF and shared through social and civic media channels to generate action.
The program utilizes a smartphone application called UNICEF-GIS to produce geotagged reports which are automatically uploaded onto a digital map and then curated, completed, verified and published on Voices of Youth Maps and shared through public channels. UNICEF-GIS is powered by Open Locast, a location based media framework developed by the MIT Mobile Experience Lab, which not only provided the framework, but also has worked on its customization for this prototype from its very inception.
In order to be useful for those actors, the process of data collection must be comprehensive, in the sense that it must produce reports that reveal as many issues as possible. That is, if at the end of the day

Durante los primeros 45 de la parte inicial los Red Bull tuvieron muchas llegadas de peligro pero sin marcar ningún gol y así se fueron al descanso.

Continuando con la racha de los vestidos fresquitos, os traigo hoy un look que además de ser cómodo, el estampado no puede faltar en tu armario de verano por ser un clásico: las rayas marineras.
Este vestido de rayas es de Mango, la tela no se arruga que viene perfecto en esta época (ya que planchar en verano es la muerte), las mangas tienen unas aberturas hasta el hombro que le dan un toque más juvenil y el broche final lo tiene en la espalda que se deja entrever a media altura con un lazo al cuello. ¡No me puede gustar más, y lo mejor su precio que está ahora de rebajas!
Os cuento una curiosidad que no sé si sabréis sobre las rayas marineras, y es que una de las primeras en introducir la prenda en forma de camiseta de rayas en el mundo de la moda fue la diseñadora Coco Chanel en 1917, cuya inspiración le llegó al observar la indumentaria de los marineros de la costa Normanda.
Gracias a esta diseñadora y muchos otros, hoy en día continuamos llevando las rayas marineras a muchos de nuestros outfits, y es que les consigue dar un toque de color, alegría y frescura a nuestros looks, además de evocarnos a París, el mar y la libertad.

China's intelligence operations are the "core arena" for achieving the superpower status that the Communist oligarchy in Beijing so passionately desires. Central to its spy activities is the island of Cuba, which is strategically located for the interception of U.S. military and civilian satellite communications. China's spy services also cooperates closely with Havana's own world-class intelligence services.
Inexplicably, the U.S. mass media are ignoring both the existence of the spy base as well as the Cuban-Chinese alliance responsible for it.
International News Analysis Today is challenging that media silence in an exclusive interview with counter-intelligence expert Chris Simmons, who explains why China needs Cuba and details the dangers to the United States in Havana's espionage partnership with Beijing.
Simmons is a retired Counter-intelligence Special Agent with 28 years service in the Army, Army Reserve, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and has testified on the subject of Cuban espionage before members of U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Simmons notes that China has the largest espionage network in the world with an estimated two million career staff intelligence officers, making Beijing's spy services larger than the intelligence operations of all the other nations in the world combined.
While Americans are well aware of China's financial might, its espionage activities get relatively little attention.
"We are too often distracted by China's economic gains. For China, however, espionage and economics are tied hand in hand, and China has the largest appetite for U.S. secrets in the world," Simmons told International News Analysis Today.

DeMaria’s newest release, "The Maiden of Stonehenge," takes his music in yet another direction. The music is the soundtrack to a play by the same name written by DeMaria and Stephen Lott, (who also co-wrote the the play "Siyotanka" several years ago). This time the play takes place in ancient Britain and tells the story of the coming of age of Teagan, a young, disfigured orphan girl abandoned and left to fend for herself. Her journey takes her across the mythic land where she meets wild and wondrous creatures while discovering the healing powers of nature, water, and her own voice. Two of the tracks feature 17-year-old Maggie Crain, who played the lead in the Pensacola Little Theatre production of the play in early 2012. DeMaria composed and performed all of the music, playing a variety of flutes and whistles, percussion, voice, piano, and synthesizers. As with all of Dr. DeMaria’s projects, the music is soothing, enchanting, and powerfully emotional.

Por ello se suele circunscribir la moral al conjunto de valoraciones y elecciones en términos de bien y mal (que lleven aparejadas la etiqueta “bueno” y “malo”) en el ámbito de las relaciones y comportamientos sociales, y con un horizonte temporal amplio (al menos para las consecuencias de los actos).
Así, decisiones de vida o muerte, salud y enfermedad, colaboración y explotación, ayuda, indiferencia o perjuicio, fidelidad o traición...etc etc...son morales en sentido estricto.

With most directors, it would be the exact opposite. But not all directors uncork their imaginations onscreen the way Rodriguez does; as an audience, we get to see every little ounce of creativity he’s got.
The original Spy Kids was a giddy delight, a well-rounded film that stressed the narrative power of a family bond and the economical power of a dollar. Rodriguez made that film for $35 million – paltry by Hollywood standards. Rodriguez knows that if it ain’t broke, you don’t fix it. Thus, he’s kept his budget corralled and his themes stronger than ever in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, which is not as zippy as its predecessor, but is still a worthy follow-up.
The plot in Spy Kids 2 is merely a hook on which to hang Rodriguez’s visuals and themes. Carmen and Juni Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) have returned, only this time as part of an entire team of Spy Kids assembled in the wake of their initial success. When a gadget called the Transmooker (which shuts down all power in the area when turned on) is mysteriously stolen, only the original Spy Kids can bring it back.

I just have to applaud Rodriguez for his decision to make the creatures on the Island of Lost Dreams a la’ Ray Harryhausen rather than the smooth gloss of Computer Animation. It lends itself beautifully to the idea that this is a place where computers don’t work. Where being a good spy is about skill and heart rather than stuff.
And this is a movie with a lot of heart. Like Spy Kids I, the emphasis is on family and the emotional ties that bind us together. Especially nice because our spy kids are getting a little bit older.
Carmen, played by Alexa Vega (who will be a real beauty in a few years), is starting to notice boys, particularly bad boy rival spy, Gary Giggles. Hearing a pre-teen spout the words from so many much older movies, “He’s a bad boy, but I can change him.” is really funny.

Parents need to know that unlike the inventive and funny Spy Kids and Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over plays almost entirely inside a video game. Other than Juni and friends trying to shut down the game and save the world, there's very little story. Instead, it's a series of attacks, disappearances, wins, and losses that carry the heroes from one game level to the next. High-tech danger comes in the form of giant robots, molten lava rocks, troops of evil toys, explosions, light saber attacks, and crashes, some of which may be scary for the youngest kids. Messages about teamwork and family are consistent with the first two films, but are spoken more often than played.

For reasons unknown, despite having a starring role (ahem) in the Love Actually Christmas Nativity, the iconic octopus was not revisited in the Red Nose Day sequel.
WHY BBC? WHY? "Eight is a lot of legs David" is a classic!
Luckily for us, his godmother took to Twitter instead to give us an update on what Natalie's little brother looks like now — and it's safe to say he's shed his slithery skin (and six legs, presumably) to blossom into a good looking human.
Actress Kathy Burke shared a screenshot from Love Actually along with a picture of her godson 13 years later, with the caption: "Want to feel old? Here's what octopus boy aka my godson, Bill looks like now."
The Independent say his name is Billy Campbell, and yes, we do feel very old right now.
This comes as Lulu Popwell, who played the equally iconic Second Lobster, said previously: "Every Christmas, people still bring Love Actually up to me and I get a bit awkward because I was such a small part in it.
"It's become a joke. I clearly peaked age 11 and there aren't many crustacean-based acting roles going these days – it's a niche skill."

At that moment, nature had an impact on her and she got introduced to the peasant life. During this time, she acquired a peculiar habit: she would never cry. She developed this habit because her parents would tell her older siblings that men must not cry, if they do so, they would look like women. This commentary made her wonder why only women had the right to cry. Therefore, she resolved not to cry over nothing.

The only differences are the package that’s soldered to the board, with RX Vega 64 getting half of the Vega Frontier Edition’s memory and adjusted firmware. The only reason the card needs to be this long is to accommodate the cooler and large radial fan. It could be shortened to the size of a Radeon R9 Nano with ease.
On the back of the board, we spy a densely-packed area under the GPU/memory, a PWM controller, and several other surface-mounted components.
At the center of it all is International Rectifier's IR35217, a poorly-documented, dual-output, multi-phase controller able to provide six phases for the GPU and two additional phases. A closer look reveals 12 regulator circuits though, not just six. This is a result of doubling, allowing the load from each phase to be distributed between two regulator circuits.
Six IR3598 interleaved MOSFET drivers on the back of the board are responsible for the doubling. These are the parts we pointed out earlier. The following video we created using AMD's Frontier Edition card starts at idle and shows how the PWM controller switches the load back and forth between circuits. This keeps efficiency high by using only one phase, but also avoids overloading a single circuit over prolonged periods of time.

Time travel has always been a risky proposition. Cinema and literature have shown us that it does not matter whether we travel to the past or the future, we always end up fleeing desperately from both. I suppose that, in general, humans are trapped in their era, displeased, as prisoners who feel deeply that they could not live happily under different contexts. We worry: could we take our family, children, and friends on this time traveling journey? What do we do with our dogs or cats? And what about our Facebook account?
Only art can take us on this trip to another dimension and time. As each generation will have its own ways of interpreting, manipulating, or rereading artworks, it can still be equally traumatic. In any case, it’s all the same, because nobody from the past will reappear to complain. The Walker’s Cinema Revolution: Cuba film series thus prompts

If you’ve ever been to LA, you’ve met a Salvadoran. 24th STreet Theatre sits in an immigrant community comprised mostly of Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans. Many years ago the US Embassy in El Salvador called and asked if we’d like to come there with one of our Spanish-language shows. We were thrilled. That phone call was the beginning of a life-changing relationship for me with El Salvador. Since then we have had the honor of working there four times, three of those trips being at the invitation of the US State Department’s Cultural Envoy program. We have taught theatre workshops for kids and adults and teachers, performed at orphanages, held roundtables with local theatre artists, worked with El Salvador’s youth symphony, done many press interviews and public events, and performed shows at the beautiful Teatro Luis Poma in San Salvador. Deb, Chima and I have made dear lifelong friends there. And on every one of our four trips to Central America, I have had deeply personal conversations with my Salvadoran friends about their politics, economics, crime, international relations, the history of the civil war there, and the U.S.’s role in El Salvador during the war and now.

The movie is loaded with good intentions, but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story, Minac drains his movie of all individuality.
As banal as the telling may be -- and at times, All My Loved Ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention.

The story is short, subtle, but very simple. This is a short story of an emotionless, silent hitman who shows glimpses of humanity throughout his attempts to kill his target. He’s a menacing figure whose name is kept as a secret to support his menacing side that the viewer will mostly see. Most of what happens in the film isn’t told in the script (told in the storyboard). To sum everything up, this is a short film with cool action scenes and an intriguing background of the main character.

Bag of Bones is one of the better Stephen King adaptations I have seen and I think it's the best "King" telemovie since Storm Of The Century. The novel was described as a haunted love story and the film captures that theme really well. Pierce Brosnan plays a high profile novelist whose wife is killed in a tragic accident. With the conviction that he cannot write anymore without her he is compelled to spend time away at his lakeside retreat, which is a place his wife would escape to while he was immersed in his work. Before long he starts having visions and believes that his wife brought him to the lake house for a reason. The film follows the book closely and all of King's intentions are represented on the screen. A few slight details are altered and/or omitted for the film, but all for the sake of a stronger onscreen story. Unlike many of King's film adaptations, Bag of Bones doesn't venture into hokey territory, albeit for 2 mysteriously sinister characters... but even then, they aren't forced into heightened caricatures like many previous King adaptations.

Developing an early interest in literature and the arts, he was a published poet at the age of only 19 and by the time he began his career in film 13 years later, he had already established himself as an eminent essayist, critic and novelist.
Having collaborated on a number of screenplays including Federico Fellini’s La Notti di Cabiria/Nights of Cabiria (1956) and Mauro Bolognini’s Il Bell’Antonio (1960), Pasolini finally began his own career as a writer-director in 1961 with Accatone, a film based upon one of his own novels, Una Vita Violenta (A Violent Life). The film created an immediate impact when it premiered at the 22nd Venice Film Festival, due in part to its grittily realistic and hitherto barely glimpsed depiction of a sub-proletarian Rome, populated by thieves, pimps, hustlers and prostitutes. Seen from a distance of more than 45 years, however, what’s most striking about Pasolini’s debut is neither its seedy milieu nor even the director’s talent for storytelling (the plotting and exposition in the early scenes are particularly clumsy and confusing), but the power of the film’s compassion and raw beauty.

Whilst there are many films which are edited to appear to be one-shot I.e. Iñárritu’s Birdman (2015) and Hitchcock’s Rope, (1948) Sebastian Schipper’s Victoria’s tagline “One girl, One night, One city, One shot” doesn’t disappoint. Filmed over 138 minutes, between the hours of 4.30am and 7.30am, Victoria follows the title character into a night of adrenaline fuelled action, one which is heightened dramatically by the tension and realism the one shot allows. This heightened state means that any tension is intensified, but so is any of boredom, joy, distress, making Victoria an emotional roller-coaster and an all-round unforgettable experience.
From the offset we are forced, as a non German speaking audience to relate to Victoria’s remoteness, creating an instant connection with us and the title character, meaning that despite the film’s inconsistencies, it’s hard not to feel emotionally invested in what will happen to Victoria (Laia Costa) throughout the film. What makes this more exciting is the entire cast’s improvised dialogue and reactions which draws us in and helps give the film the quality of running on real time, creating even more tension through the unpredictability of the cast’s performances.
Amazingly, the cinematography in Victoria isn’t compromised by the one shot take, instead the film which was shot with a EOS C300 Canon, is high quality and contradictory due to it’s rawness and beauty, captured despite the film’s unorthodox film-making choices, which awarded cinematographer, Sturla Brandth Grøvlen the German Film Award

Titled after the song by Randy California and Spirit for their album The Dreams of Dr Sardonicus, Nature’s Way’s circular structure and melancholic tone resonates with feelings of alienation and the urgent desire to reconnect to nature. This song is especially resonant during this time of destabilized weather patterns and our collective recognition of globalized industry and exponential capital’s impact. The artworks in the exhibition are culled from the individual artists experiences negotiating the strictures of contemporary life, often by embodying the delirious potential of the natural sublime. These desiring machines machinate the psychological dimension of their contemporary urban experiences through their making. In this way, the works are tools of agency in a period of anxious upheaval.
Written on the back of Spirits first real hit, 1984, the album The Dreams of Dr Sardonicus marked a deeper engagement for Randy California and the band with the emerging social and environmental crisis. Essentially distopic, the title of the album refers to a film in which the audience is witness to the delirious deviancy of the protagonist, Dr. Sardonicus, and then given the ‘opportunity’ at the end to vote for or against his annihilation. This pantomime of democratic process reverberates in our current climate, a time when many feel helpless in facing the mores and obscured intentions of the elected leaders, a moment that has begun to shake and fragment our belief in the possibility for moral ethic beyond avarice.

Ben Wheatley returns this month with his latest feature film Free Fire, which blends brutal action and sharp humour to create a roaring success of a film that will keep audiences entertained way beyond the 90 minute running time.
The premise of the film for Wheatley stemmed from Wheatley reading online of various police stand-offs throughout history. He found one that lasted 45 minutes because neither party could hit their targets, despite years of training to do precisely that (sadly I can’t find the article to link to). This tickled a nerve with Wheatley, who thought it would be brilliant to see it on the big screen – especially since most stand-offs in films last no more than a minute.
Set in the 1970s, the story revolves around two gangs meeting in a warehouse to make a trade for some arms. One group includes Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley), both presumably sourcing their weapons for IRA-related activities (though this is never explicitly mentioned), along with headstrong Justine (Brie Larson), idiotic junkie Stevo (Sam Riley) and even-more-idiotic Bernie (Enzo Cilenti).

In Contagion an outbreak of a deadly new virus triggers panic on a global scale while scientists and health officials race to find a cure. It is precisely because this isn't a horror film that it's so effectively scary; the most accurate description would be a dramatic thriller.
This is a movie that thoroughly examines the painstaking and frustrating process of trying to stop a virus, the politics of fear, and the great compassion and courage (as well as opportunism and destruction) that people display in moments of crises. Indeed, it reminded me of Viktor Frankl's wonderful book Man's Search For Meaning, in that a person's true character comes to light when their life and the lives of others are threatened. Contagion also provides a sobering and frightening reminder of what the total breakdown of society is like.
The direction is gripping and creative and the pacing is nearly-perfect: Soderberg knows when to speed a scene along and when to let it breathe. He gives his actors a lot to do and they all shine, especially Damon, who continues to be a main contender for the greatest actor of this generation. His relationship with his little surviving family provides the film's greatest warmth and heart (as well as it's most heartbreaking,

The film comes to life when veteran actress Tippi Hedren arrives for her cameo.
Lead actress Jess Weixler (from Teeth and Alexander The Last) never really finds the right tone for her character Jillian, a surly and sarcastic young woman who is roped into helping run Mike’s Dream ice cream truck handing out free ice cream samples while her friend heads off on a mission of mercy. It is a film likely to find much in the way of sales, with VOD its only likely outlet.
Jesse Eisenberg crops up in the opening scene (amusingly wearing a Stetson and answering to the name of Tex) as Jillian and her friends get drunk in a bar. He appears again an hour to give the film a much-needed boost, though quite why his character is so entranced by Jillian is never clear.
While grumpily handing out ice cream – either vanilla or chocolate only – in a remote suburban Los Angeles lot, on paper Jillian is supposed to interact with a series of oddball characters. Sadly Jim Beggarly’s script offers nothing vaguely amusing, and these moments are merely a series of outlets for Jillian’s unexplained sarcasm.

Sam (co-director) and I had travelled to a rural Australian town called Lithgow a few times with other projects and having scouted the place, we came to realise the socio-demographic profile portrayed an incredibly interesting slice of life. So we began simmering the idea behind Pighead.
At the risk of sounding too dramatic, as a relatively young filmmaker, there’s a daily pressure to life that comes with a low security, low success rate profession.

Loosely based on the bestselling novel by Jeff VanderMeer, this cerebral film reflects and fragments 2016’s Arrival and offers more questions than answers akin to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.
So why is it the powerhouse studio Paramount got cold feet about the profitability of the film’s cinematic release? Arrival garnered critical accolades after its release, and 2001 is considered by many to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.
In the end, it came down to the test-screenings. Results indicated the movie might be “too intellectual” for mainstream audiences. Paramount subsequently decided to cut their losses – handing the film’s international release over to Netflix.
It’s true that Annihilation’s ominous tone and examination of the essence of humanity won’t be for everyone. But in an era where the genre too often leans towards the predictable and explosive, a film that is meticulously designed to allow for intellectual engagement is long overdue.
Annihilation follows a highly-skilled team (a biologist, psychologist, physicist, geologist and a paramedic) sent to investigate The Shimmer – a phenomenon believed to have been triggered by a meteor that has engulfed a region of swampland. The steadily expanding Shimmer is having a profound impact on all living things within and entering its prism. And it’s not without terror and tension – challenging the team’s assumptions of what is explainable.

Retrieved Text: Poetic realism was a film movement in France of the 1930s. More a tendency than a movement, poetic realism is not strongly unified like Soviet montage or French Impressionism but were individuals who created this lyrical style. Its leading filmmakers were Pierre Chenal, Jean Vigo, Julien Duvivier, Marcel Carné, and, perhaps the movement's most significant director, Jean Renoir. Renoir made a wide variety of films some influenced by the leftist Popular Front group and even a lyrical short feature film. Frequent stars of these films were Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Simone Signoret, and Michèle Morgan.
Poetic realism films are "recreated realism", stylised and studio-bound, rather than approaching the "socio-realism of the documentary". They usually have a fatalistic view of life with their characters living on the margins of society, either as unemployed members of the working class or as criminals. After a life of disappointment, the characters get a last chance at love but are ultimately disappointed again and the films frequently end with disillusionment or death. The overall tone often resembles nostalgia and bitterness. They are "poetic" because of a heightened aestheticism that sometimes draws attention to the representational aspects of the films. Though these films were weak in the production sector, French cinema did create a high proportion of influential films largely due to the talented people in the industry in the 1930s who were working on them. The most popular set designer was Lazare Meerson. Composers who worked on these films included Georges Auric, Arthur Honegger, Joseph Kosma, and Maurice Jaubert. Screenwriters who contributed to many of the films included Charles Spaak and Jacques Prévert. The movement had a significant impact

Films like Arrivaland Annihilation show a surreal and cerebral view of what occurs during these invasions, while films like Independence Dayand War of the Worldsshow the destructive intent these alien invaders possess. Somewhere in the middle there are films like Men in Blackand Mars Attacks!that poke fun at the genre. And then there’s Captive State, a movie that sets up a pretty interesting post-invasion landscape and forgets to finish the rest of the plot.
The film begins with a short introduction of the ensuing alien invasion, following a family attempting to escape Chicago during a chaotic evacuation. After the escape fails, two young brothers are left orphaned in this new alien-controlled world. We watch a fast forwarded account of the nine years that followed as the human population begin to conform to their new alien “legislators” to meet their demands. While even the police begin to comply with the demands of the aliens, a small group of rebels work in secret to chip away at this invading race and take back their world.
It’s an idea that intrigues on paper and looses steam in execution. Where Captive State fails is its lack of character building.

Perhaps they took the term too seriously, because most of the film is full of ‘hard-hitting’ stunts – punches, throat-slitting, stabbing, and hitting people with long iron rods. To be honest, the sound of ‘iron-rod-meets-skull’ is still ringing in my ears.
The film revolves around two friends, Sathya (Vikranth) and Karthi (Aravind Singh). Both are orphans and both work at a fast food joint. Karthi and Indu (Abhinaya) are in love, and their story becomes complicated once they realise they want to get married. It leads to Sathya facing the man responsible for his mother’s death. The tale of vengeance is simple, in a way. But it’s decorated with so many unwanted elements that drag the screenplay hither and thither that it leaves the audience unconvinced about the entire plot.
The film showcases the world of human trafficking and its perils. The first ten minutes of the film are about Vikranth’s mother. As a teenager, she’s dragged into the world of prostitution. Certainly, this tugs at our heartstrings. But the dialogues, and the clichéd scenes leave us just a tad disturbed. The director wants the audience to feel bad at the plight of his characters.

No feature of their otherwise unremarkable existence is deemed too trivial for scrutiny.

At one point, two dozen tourists visit the apartment and watch fascinatedly as Claudine and Jean-Michel make small talk at dinnertime. "Guess how much the cheese cost?" Claudine asks dismally, with the visitors craning to overhear every word.
Eventually, Jean-Michel and Claudine, a sheepish twosome who are stripped bare literally in the film's opening sequence and figuratively in the privacy-breaching episodes that follow, begin to bristle at their status as guinea pigs.

Well, del Toro has always had a consistent look to his films and there’s only so many different outfits he could squeeze Doug Jones into. More importantly this new film has a very different tone than the previous comic book adaptation. This is a thought-provoking, character driven fantasy romance.
Elisa (Hawkins) is an enigmatic character, yet remains fascinating. For most of the film Hawkins’ performance is subtle and understated, delivering most of the role through her eyes. Many screenwriters and directors rely all to much on dialogue for telling stories and developing characters in a visual medium and this demonstrates how much can be achieved when the right actor and director strip that one component away from themselves.
Without wanting to get into the details, this is a story about outsiders whose development comes from their bond with each other. The relationship between Elisa and the creature (Jones) moves into directions that most films would never consider.

In this parable there are four people: the eldest son, the youngest son, the father and us.
The youngest son. He is a profiteer. Thinking only of himself, he wants money and is not ashamed to ask for the inheritance even before his father is dead. He does not know how to thank, recognize or serve his father. He demands, requests and complains. He is rotten by selfishness. He does not know how to love; he is a specialist in taking advantage of others.
Frequently we are presented with that son as an example because of his conversion and we forget that he returned to his father's house forced by hunger and misfortune.

Agapornis are precious little birds that are always next to their partner. They need to be always together. When the couple gets together, they will never get apart again. Their love is so intense that if one of them passes away, the other one will die of sadness. Agapornis need to be always side by side. What makes them the happiest is to be comfortably together in their cozy little love-nest.
Swallows have a different style. They also have a lifelong love to whom they give unconditional loyalty, nevertheless, they like to fly alone. Sometimes they are together, sometimes they are far away. Their love is so immense that they blindly trust each other, no matter the distance. They need moments of solitude so they can miss each other. What makes them the happiest is to be free, and to meet again after a journey.
The two types of love are good.
Problems come when a poor agaporni falls in love with a swallow that flies far away and leaves him lonely, or when an unfortunate swallow is confined for sharing life with an agaporni.
It isn’t impossible to reach an agreement, but you always have to respect the other one and you can’t force them to abandon their principles. Both of them need to be understood, agapornis and swallows, and their wills have to be respected. Both of them have different needs.
They are different and beautiful natures.

We begin the book with the phrase “knowledge is power” because all of our shared tasks as women to better our health begin with what we know and learn from each other. If we have access to education and information about our health, there is much we can do to improve the basic conditions necessary for our families and communities to thrive. To know is to have the power to learn and change, the power to disagree, to explore and to enjoy. To know is to have the power to be free and independent and also the power to love and support the well-being of those around us; in sum, to know is to be a woman, fully empowered.
In the first section of this book we present a vision of good health as well-being in all of life’s dimensions. We emphasize the importance of joining with other women in order to create a more just world that supports the well-being of all. We also explain that the medical system must be used with care, recognizing that our good health doesn’t start with the medical establishment but from the quality of our lives and relationships. The education and information offered by books are just some of the indispensable tools for a more just world. We also need the support of other women who validate our experiences,

His actor-director partnership with Martin Scorsese – currently represented by nine films; here’s hoping for that elusive tenth – rightly stands beside the likes of Ford and Wayne, Kurasawa and Mifune, and Herzog and Kinski as one of the great collaborations in film’s history. Together, the infamous pair went on to make such iconic classics as Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas, and Casino. It is a testament to De Niro’s significance as a performer that those films only represent a handful of the masterpieces he is associated with.

I’ve liked Bradley Cooper since Alias days, so I’m glad he’s getting some great parts like this and recognition for them.

Helping him out is Jennifer Lawrence, who’s not necessarily totally stable herself (her cop husband died in a freak accident, which sent her into some fairly self-destructive behaviors), but is trying to find an outlet through dance, and she draws Cooper in.

The project is in development with Universal and Montecito Pictures and the big twist they’re hoping to build it on this time is that it’s not just twins, it’s triplets. If you remember the first movie had DeVito and Schwarzenegger playing long lost twin brothers conceived experimentally. But it seems there was another matched brother neither of them knew about, and it’s Eddie Murphy. That must have been one helluva womb.
It sounds like the Twins sequel, tentatively titled Triplets is still in pretty early developmental stages. THR says they don’t even have a director yet, though they’re certain it won’t be the director of the 1988 film, Ivan Reitman. He’ll only serve as a producer on the follow-up.
If this happens it’ll either be the funniest movie of 2014 and finally provide the Eddie Murphy career revitalization everyone’s been hoping for, or it’ll set a record for the most Razzies won by any one film in a single calendar year. There’s no room for middle ground here.

If swirling rumors are believed to be true, legendary comedian Eddie Murphy and Netflix could be teaming up for a project that sounds absolutely hilarious.
If the project does indeed move forward Brett Ratner, who directed Murphy most recently in 2011’s Tower Heist, would direct with Chris Case penning the script. Since the film’s process is contingent upon approval of the script, it could be awhile before audiences actually (if ever) see it.

The film opens with the upwardly mobile Silberstein clan led by Jakub (Josef Abrham), as he buys a villa in the countryside just before Hitler overruns the country. His blind faith in family unity ironically keeps a number of his relatives in the country to be victimized by the Nazis. Meanwhile, British humanitarian Nicholas Winton (Rupert Graves) tries to rescue hundreds of Czech children and get them out of the country.
A tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film, whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events.
The movie is loaded with good intentions, but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story, Minac drains his movie of all individuality.

As the slow, lazy summer draws to a close, parents and children are preparing for school, homework, hectic schedules, Sunday and Hebrew school. Add in other extra-curricular activities, and life during the school year can be overwhelming, and can seriously detract from family time.
When the time came for our eldest to begin his Jewish education journey, we were both proud, and quite sad. The loss of his free time, and the additional burden to his schedule impacted all of us. But, we were more fortunate than most, since we are Hebrew school and Judaic teachers.

We continued to teach, even after our second son was born, and again after the third. But then, we as parents, decided to stop teaching in such a way because we had a revolutionary idea for the Jewish community.

Not surprisingly, they were told that they could not enroll their children in this school. The parents then brought a class action suit against the Topeka Board of Education to try and get it to end its policy of segregated education. The court case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which issued a decision in 1954.
The Supreme Court found in favor of the parents. They stated that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. It is not possible to have "separate but equal" facilities.
In 1950, the American Jewish Committee hired a black psychologist, Kenneth Clark, to study the impact of school segregation on black children. He found that segregated education had a large impact on black children's self-esteem. Clark's research and findings became a major part of the brief prepared by the NAACP in this case.

The Torah comes to describe the empty space of no children and the need for prayer to fill that void. In the next verse Isaac prays for a child opposite Rebecca which Rashi explains to mean that Isaac and Rebecca each prayed on their own, he in one corner of the room and she in the other, – i.e. the first Shul.
Though communal prayer is something comparatively recent in Jewish history (since the destruction of the Temple), nevertheless it seems to play a central role in our public Jewish life today, and procedural concerns surrounding it can loom large in a community. Recently, I was asked about women saying kaddish in shul and whether hearing the voice of a woman saying kaddish is of halachic concern.
The question of whether a woman may say kaddish for a loved one has been treated extensively in halachic literature. Raav Yosef Henkin famously permitted it and this has become the normative practice in many modern orthodox Shuls, and indeed, according to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, was always the custom going back many generations. Even so, for some the voice of women saying kaddish along with men sounds incongruous in an orthodox synagogue.

This Torah portion appears to be a list of endless and often seemingly irrelevant rules. Some we carefully follow. Others have been assigned to history. Perhaps it is because they are specifically related to a time and place that no longer speaks to us. Often, it is because we do not understand the depth of wisdom contained in the Torah’s directives for our daily lives. Even if the specific obligation may be obscure, the principle that underlies it may bring insight and meaning into our lives.
Those of us who work with families know that there is often tension between generations, sometimes as a result of decisions that adult children make. While the Torah writes in the extremes, as it often does, the basic principle is sound. We may feel responsible for the actions of our children–but we are not responsible.
People should be responsible for their own acts–whether they be negative or positive. And yet, we often hold the children of intermarriage responsible for the decision that their parents made. Instead we should be reaching out to them with open arms.
Consider this relevant lesson from the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 268:11): If parents convert to Judaism and they have children and raise those children as Jews and their conversion later becomes suspect, the parents may be considered as not Jewish but the status of the children should not be questioned.

It had been manufactured, he said, in the early 1900s, by Kammer & Reinhardt, a well-known German doll-making company, in business from 1886 to 1932. It was the cutoff date that caught my attention — could this have been a Jewish company that closed down as the Nazis rose to power? The company’s logo on the doll’s back confirmed my suspicion. It showed the initials K and R separated by a Star of David. That star set my mind racing. Did the company’s owners end up wearing the proud symbol of their firm as the oppressive yellow star that marked Europe’s Jews during their darkest days?

Irena Sandler: In the Name of Their Mothers is the story of a group of young Polish women, who outfoxed the Nazis during World War II and saved the lives of thousands of Jewish children.
Irena Sendler, a petite social worker, was not yet thirty years old when Nazi tanks rolled into Warsaw in September of 1939. When the city's Jews were imprisoned behind a ghetto wall without food or medicine, she appealed to her closest friends and colleagues, mostly young women, some barely out of their teens. Together, they smuggled aid in and smuggled Jewish orphans out of the ghetto by hiding infants on trams and garbage wagons and leading older children out through secret passageways and the city’s sewers. Catholic birth certificates and identity papers were forged and signed by priests and high ranking officials in the Social Services Department so that the children could be taken from safe houses in Warsaw to orphanages and convents in the surrounding countryside.
The scheme was fraught with danger. The city was crawling with ruthless blackmailers, and the Gestapo were constantly on the look out for Jews who had escaped from the ghetto.

The New York Jewish Week: A Turning Point For Disability Advocates?
One-day conference may mark the beginning of a new era in Jewish communal attitudes.
Despite good intentions by the organized Jewish community and some model programs, for years it has largely fallen to the parents of children with mental illness, intellectual, physical, learning, social and other disabilities and differences to battle for "a place at the table" for their children in Jewish day schools, synagogues and summer camps.
Almost every parent of a child with a significant disability can tell of the heartbreak of rejection of their children by the community, or at the very least, the struggles they had to wage to allow their child to lay claim to some piece of their Jewish identity.
Adults with disabilities can tell stories of the lack of appreciation of the community's role in allowing them access -- physical and social – and too often they are relegated to the back of the line in terms of communal priorities.
This is true even in New York, which offers some of the best services for Jews with disabilities. More can and must be done.

Jews have additional disabilities because of genetic differences and choices to have children later in life, which can lead to autism and Down's syndrome.

This is especially true for children from birth to six years of age when their brains are still developing.
Examples of trauma are neglect, poverty, physical abuse, substance abuse in the home, parental unemployment or social isolation. However, there are steps we can all take to ensure children are protected and families are well-functioning. They are called Protective Factors, and they serve as safeguards helping parents who might be at risk of abusing their children, instead find resources, support, and coping strategies to parent effectively even under stress.
Knowledge of parenting and child development: Parents increase their knowledge and strengthen their social connections when they participate in group activities like the Parent Café’s offered through Catholic Charities of Kansas City-St. Joseph. Increasing parental competency by learning about a child’s changing needs can instill positive techniques for managing behavior.
Parental resilience: Parents who manage stress serve as role models for their children, setting an example of self-regulation and problem-solving.

The beloved 90s cartoon is coming back in a major way.
Folks, grab your pacifiers. On Monday, it was announced that Rugrats, the beloved 90s Nickelodeon cartoon about precocious babies, will get the reboot treatment in a new animated series. Finally, the kids of today will be re-introduced to the hijinks of Tommy and Chuckie and the domineering Angelica. But that’s not all! Apparently, Paramount is also planning another Rugrats movie. David Goodman (Family Guy) is set to write the film, which will hit theaters on November 13, 2020. Original show creators Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó, and Paul Germain will come back to executive produce the relaunched series.
All that sounds great! And fun! Except that the studio also announced that it’s going to be a live-action/C.G.I. hybrid movie, which prompts us to ask just one quick question: what?
And rendering an appealing non-human C.G.I. character is very different from rendering a non-creepy C.G.I. baby. Maybe the effects team behind Rugrats will figure out a way to make this thing a touch more Who Framed Roger Rabbit than nu-T.M.N.T. Here’s a quick teaser of what you can expect.
Just kidding—that’s a trailer for Baby Geniuses, the 1999 classic about babies who are, well, geniuses. It’s very bad! But also kind of good, and a prime example of the first thing we think of when we hear “live-action baby movie.” Godspeed, Rugrats.

Recently, I've modified my opinion. I find that if I read a book first and then watch the movie, I am bound to be disappointed. For imaginative readers, reading a book is like playing the whole movie in your mind. No movie CAN live up to it. The thing is impossible. At every point you'll be searching for so and so scene, a certain character, or the perfect manner of speaking the dialogue. At best, you can find a movie enjoyable, but rest assured there will be something everyone doesn't like. It doesn't even have to be the same thing, but according to each reader's taste, everyone will find some flaw. But if you watch the movie first, without reading the book, and THEN read the book, there is a chance that you just might like the film adaptation and say that the book was great, but the movie was good too! This is because one, you don't go into the movie with so many expectations and two, because you can think of it as separate from the book (I find this truer for fantasy films, because the magic makes it much better to SEE things).
The Lord of the Rings is my best example. I hadn't read the books when I watched the movies, and at the time, I thought the movies were good, not great. But after reading the books, I finds that I'm in love with both!

That means that it's also featuring plenty of gadgets, exotic or far off locations and a typical spy-thriller plot but only all done bigger, though not necessarily better as well.
You can't exactly call the series the most consistent. Every movie so far has been quite different in style and tone. I thought that this movie did a pretty good job at combining all of the best elements out of the first three movies, into this one. It has the sort of spy and thriller elements of the first movie, the action of the second one and the more realistic approach of the third movie.
Then why isn't it the best movie out of the series you might wonder. Because it's still suffering from the same problems as the previous two movies did; It has a far too simplistic story in it. Yes, I wasn't that big on "Mission: Impossible III", while the rest of the world seemed to absolutely love it at the time and lots of people called it one of the best action movies ever made. But as things turned out later, more and more people start to see and realize "Mission: Impossible III" wasn't all that perfect at all and most already seem to have already forgotten about that movie now days.

Last Sunday, the CBC aired a TV mystery-movie, Still Life: A Three Pines Mystery.
I'm guessing either the CBC didn't send out copies to reviewers, or the press just wasn't that interested, because doing a quick google search for reviews doesn't bring up a whole lot.
Still, it raises some interesting topics for a pop cultural observer.
Based on Louise Penny's novels about Quebec police Inspector Gamache, it follows the British format of recent years of doing TV movies, rather than an hour long series (perhaps explaining why they cast British actor Nathaniel Parker as the lead).
Not that the format is unheard of in North America. In the U.S. Tom Selleck starred in the Jesse Stone TV movies, and in the 1970s CBS enjoyed great success with its "mystery wheel" movies. While in Canada, the mystery movie series was an experiment a few years back ranging from the Joanne Kilbourn movies (with Wendy Crewson) to a quartet of Sherlock Holmes films (starring a decidedly eccentric Matt Frewer opposite a sturdily heroic Kenneth Welsh as Watson).
As well as promising orphan movies meant to spawn sequels, but didn't. Such as the enjoyable Harry's Case, starring Brian Markinson and Adam Beach, or Tripping the Wire, starring the charismatic but too often underutilized Clark Johnson. The latter was presumptuously sub-titled "A Stephen Tree Mystery" even though no further adventures followed.

The movie forms a nice first set up for the future series of Harry Potter movies. Still I'm glad the movies and its characters have matured a lot since this movie. Probably also has to do with the fact that this movie and the second were directed by Chris Columbus who is an experienced children movie director, while the other Harry Potter movies were directed by more 'serious' directors.

But right now, no plans for him to direct any of the next batch of 3.
Combination of both tbh. Currently looking at a 15 year plan, with it determined by an each movie's basis for minor adjustments as needed to whatever after still under discussion. Granted that can change at any time, but most of what's going forward in plans currently is what was planned during/before the writer's room, with timing expanded out a little bit better because it was getting too quickly paced inducing audience burnout too fast alongside other issues.
The Bay movies are staying continuity, but the aesthetic style will evolve, the story style and the character focus are going to change along with the emphasis.
So what's coming next in batch will either cement that forward, or induce a faster complete reset. But a complete reset also means losing any content that could be done faster like other areas of the lore/other series while there is established material currently.
Though much much later there might be some nice surprises. But that's towards the end of the 15 year plan.

You mentioned that your expectations were set by visual entertainment such as STAR WARS and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC. Therein lies at least part of the disconnect.
Those are NOT "science fiction" stories. They share more in common with the western genre than true (classic) sci fi. Yeah, they have space ships and lasers, but there was a time that sci fi was about the story and it's metaphorical relationship to some real contemporary human condition rather than the tech.

THE FINAL CUT is one fairly recent one that comes to mind and it did a good job (an excellent movie imo). GATTACA is another. Most modern films that are called science fiction would be better classed in other genres, but the tech has taken over the definition of the genre.

Call us naive, but we thought that maybe after the vitriolic response to "Jack & Jill," coupled with the commercial failure, that Adam Sandler might've taken a good long look at the man in the mirror and rethought his career path.
Instead, tragically, Sandler has folks at work on a sequel to "Grown Ups," reported Variety. The original starred Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider as a group of school chums who reunite on the lake where they used to go to camp as kids. And coming along for the fun were their spouses, played by the likes of Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello and Salma Hayek.
As awful as "Grown Ups" was, as reviled as it may have been, it took in $162 million, so under normal circumstances, we'd understand (if not approve of) the inclination to go back for seconds. But after the failure of "Jack & Jil," which scored a 4% on Rotten Tomatoes and earned a lowly $64 million on a budget of $79 million.
Who would've guessed 10 years ago that we'd look back on "The Wedding Singer" as Sandler's golden age?

Adam Sandler is receiving a lot of love from movie critics for his performance in the new film "The Meyerowitz Stories." Reports note that the awards buzz is getting louder as the comedian surprised moviegoers by showing his dramatic prowess. "The Meyerowitz Stories" recently screened at the Cannes Film Festival in France. When critics initially learned that an Adam Sandler movie was part of the line-up, they scoffed and wondered why the actor, who is known for his slapstick comedies, was even invited. But now, it looks like Sandler won the audience over as Danny Meyerowitz in the Netflix Original film.
"The Meyerowitz Stories" is a family drama featuring Dustin Hoffman as the patriarch Harold Meyerowitz, who is also a divorcee many times over. Ben Stiller plays Matthew, the successful younger son opposite Adam Sandler's unfortunate Danny. Elizabeth Marvel plays daughter Jean Meyerowitz.
The film begins with Harold's retirement as an art teacher at Bard College. Danny's daughter Eliza, played by Grace Van Patten, has started attending classes in the same school as a film student just as her parents go through a separation.
Danny is jobless and unskilled, except for maybe giving piano lessons. Harold, despite his life in academia, doesn't really have much success as an artist. Meanwhile, Matthew has been raking it in in Los Angeles as a finance guy. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed the complex tapestry of the Meyerowitz family.

The latest Adam Sandler vehicle— which was co-written by the formidable team of Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel—is spectacularly, unimpeachably, relentlessly preposterous. In the hands of a crackpot genius like Stephen Chow, this cartoonish romp about a Mossad operative turned New York hairdresser might have been sublimely silly. In the hands of professional Sandler crony Dennis Dugan, it's merely amiably ridiculous.
In a performance so ludicrous it threatens to retroactively negate his dramatic turns in Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, and Spanglish, Sandler plays a super-soldier who tires of endless warfare and sectarian violence and decides to fake his own death and start anew under an assumed name. In New York, he quickly becomes a superstar hairdresser, partly due to his swarthy Mediterranean charm and flair with scissors but mostly due to his habit of sexually servicing his geriatric clientele. But Sandler's past comes back to haunt him when terrorist/cab-driver Rob Schneider alerts Sandler's equally outsized arch-nemesis (John Turturro) to the legendary Israeli folk hero's whereabouts and fabulous new identity.

In the film, Jack (Sandler) was living an almost perfect life, with the exception of one, annoying constant – his twin sister Jill (also played by Sandler). Every year he has to tolerate a Thanksgiving visit from his smothering sister, who doesn’t take long to turn his life upside down. As the weekend intrusion starts stretching into a month, the siblings fight, tease, and bicker in the way only twins can. When it becomes clear Jill is never leaving, Jack sets into motion several schemes that he hopes will return Jill to where he loves her most – the other side of the country.
In the film, Sandler plays Jack, an advertising executive who is one commercial away from hitting the big time – or, if the deal falls through, unmitigated disaster. Into this turmoil comes his twin sister, Jill – who always makes things more complicated than they need to be.

A half-decent comedy that starts off well but collapses about halfway through and fails to recover.
Adam Sandler and mindless yelling go together like ramma lamma lamma ka dingedy ding de dong (as they'd no doubt say in “Grease”). So, in these days of road rage, air rage and that Slim Shady bloke, he's the obvious choice for the lead role in any movie centring around the art of losing one's rag.
Slightly less obvious are the reasons behind the selection of Jack Nicholson as the unorthodox anger management therapist who steps in to fix Sandler's case of “implosive rage”. Then again, if similarly-respected big-hitters such as Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken can humiliate themselves in substandard comic fare such as “Analyze That” and “Kangaroo Jack”, then why not Nicholson?
In fairness, “Anger Management” is far better than either of those two movies, particularly in the first half when it provides several laughable sketch situations. Sandler is Dave Buznik, an average Joe whose temper becomes increasingly tested when he's wrongfully accused of assaulting an air hostess and, by order of the court, is taken under the wing of Nicholson's eyebrow-twitching Dr Buddy Rydell.
Before long Buznik's entire life has been turned upside down by the good doctor's methods which, handily, involve plenty of opportunity for Sandler to do lots of wrestling about and shoutinhg.

Considering the dearth of options in that position for West Ham it’s admirable that Kouyate is sticking to his task the best he can but to be called lazy is ridiculous.
Kouyate himself has admitted his frustration at being deployed in that position but is willing to sacrifice himself for the team.

The tactical unconventionality served by the back three/five Herve Renard activated with Ivory Coast in 2015 and Morocco in this edition, plus the in-game flexibility he tinkered with Zambia in 2013, have caused issues for teams, and their coaches have been unable to come up with any panaceas. It’s probably the reflection of the one-dimensional coaches that dominate the touchlines of African international football.
No coach has proven his tactical acumen in recent AFCONs more than Renard, and his tournament record – just 2 losses in 22 matches since the 2010 festival – is a testament to the resiliency of his teams. The meeting between Egypt and Morocco will see Renard and Hector Cuper – two of the finer tactical minds in the tournament – go head-to-head. The Argentine is no tactical slouch and he’s arguably the only coach in the tournament able to out-tactic Renard in the purest sense – either by playing his formation or, giving him a taste of his own medicine, by playing conservative football.
The logical predication for the North African encounter is a stalemate. Two realistic coaches fully aware of the limitations of their teams have set up to mask the weaknesses and heighten their strengths.

The Selhurst Park faithful have warmed to the Senegalese international, as he always gives 100 per cent and is an extremely likeable figure around the club with his positive nature and energy.
They may, however, have overlooked just how big an impact he has made in south London, as his arrival came almost immediately after French international Yohan Cabaye departed the club at the expiry of his contract.
Cabaye offered composure, calmness and authority in the middle of the park alongside Milivojevic last season, but his contract was not renewed – this may have been down to his fitness, as the former Lille man rarely managed to complete 90 minutes last season as he hit 33 years of age.
In stark contrast, Kouyate offers a robust, pragmatic approach alongside two midfielders in McArthur and Milivojevic who are also quite industrial, although perhaps slightly better on the ball.
Having said all of that, it is unfair to judge Kouyate on circumstances out of his control, so let’s take a look at his first six months in SE25 in isolation.

In Burkina Faso, flutes from the Mossi, Lobi and Bwa people are played to accompany blazons and drums during ceremonies and mask performances. They can be played singly or in groups. A flute plays a set of notes with a complex but a very repetitive tune.
Flutes like this come in many sizes, but are of the same general structure with a human like form. One variation is the height and posture of the shoulders, which can be more raised or lowered. The instrument was used to accompany masked dances often in imitations of the tonal patterns of speech or song. Some flutes were used for different purposes by hunters.
Bwa artisans typically use strong abstract shapes to portray people and animals on sacred objects. Though Bwa art is created primarily for ritual use, its aesthetic has been appreciated far beyond the West African villages where it originated. Its geometric design, for instance, is thought to have influenced Cubism in the early 1900s.

Being an outstanding student in his home country (Burkina Faso), he won an excellence scholarship to spend the last 4 years of his studies in Romandie — the French speaking part of Switzerland. During his time in Switzerland, Jonas learned many things and decided he wanted to bring back home his knowledge to help his country, in particular his hometown Gaoua, Burkina Faso.

At this very same time, the Fondation Espoir Jeunes – a small grass root organization funded by benefactors in Switzerland- was looking for a young leader to head its project in Gaoua. The match was perfect!
The key challenge as seen by Jonas and Espoir Jeunes is education. As Gaoua and its surroundings have abundant gold reserves, many children that do not have the means to pay for their education, start working in traditional gold mines as “orpailleurs”. Although this activity does provide them with some money initially, the activity is dangerous, short-lived, and often bars the children from an education, leaving them few opportunities to develop themselves in their adult life.

Corral and The Magnificent Seven (among many other noteworthy films) has been more or less ignored by the American critical community. While the reputations of many of his peers, like John Ford and Anthony Mann, have (rightfully) increased in stature over the years, Sturges has been pushed further and further to the margins, to the point he is rarely written about, discussed or even mentioned in the pages of film journals or histories. Upon his death in 1992, he was so obscure the news of his demise took days to reach newspapers.
Yet Sturges is clearly due for a reappraisal, if only to consider what it is that makes him appealing to so many contemporary filmmakers — John Carpenter, P.T. Anderson and Lawrence Kasdan, to name three, have all professed admiration of his work and acknowledged its influence on their own styles. Clearly, anyone held in high regard by such an eclectic group must be worthy of more thoughtful consideration than Sarris’ casual dismissal would indicate, right?
The answer to that question is an unequivocal “yes” based on the convincing evidence on display in Glenn Lovell’s Escape Artist: The Life and Films of John Sturges, a combination of biography and critical analysis both reasoned and passionate in its advocacy for an overlooked director.

Since so many of Mamet�s beefs with Hollywood are familiar and indisputable � that its blockbusters emphasize spectacle over story, that its bigwigs do too little work for too much money, that its market research techniques dilute its artistry and that its reliance on group decision-making fosters mediocrity � one suspects that his interest in restating them is technical, aesthetic.

And yet, Unfaithfully Yours has been described as a film in which nothing happens. The picture spends the better part of its runtime inside the obsessive imagination of its protagonist, an easily excitable concert conductor whose pathologically jealous state adds an uncommon vitality to his art. Played by Rex Harrison, the conductor’s mind becomes the stage on which the film’s fantasized events play out, ranging from elaborate traps to the slashing of a razor, from a humble goodbye to Russian roulette. Under the false impression that his faithful and loving wife is cheating on him, he directs his orchestra, and as he does so, he loses himself in the particular mood of the given composition. In a flurry of impassioned emotion shaped by selections from Gioacchino Rossini, Richard Wagner, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, he visualizes himself in a series of sometimes vengeful fantasies. Sturges explores the notion that music not only shapes our mood but that our perceptions of the world are rarely accurate. Sturges’ dark comedy plays in the mind of a paranoiac genius not unlike himself, producing a film that represents his last great effort after a series of earlier hits. Though both the public and the studio failed to understand Unfaithfully Yours upon its release in 1948, it has since been rediscovered by more sophisticated audiences and included on the long list

Noted for his spare, gritty work that reflects the hardened attitudes of his native Chicago and often revolves around domineering male characters and their macho posturing, Mamet has time and again spurred both discussion and controversy, inciting particularly angry reactions from feminists.
Born in Chicago on November 30, 1947, Mamet studied at Vermont's Goddard College and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theatre in New York. He returned to his hometown to found the St. Nicholas Theatre Company and also worked for a time as the artistic director of the famed Goodman Theatre. Mamet first earned acclaim in 1976 for a trio of Off-Off Broadway plays, The Duck Variations, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, and America Buffalo. The latter two works were later adapted for the screen, the first becoming About Last Night (1986, it was not adapted by Mamet), and the latter released in 1996 with a script by the playwright himself.
Mamet began writing for the screen in 1981 with a re-make of The Postman Always Rings Twice, his script emphasizing the base sexuality and brutal violence of the material in a way that the original 1947 film could not.

And to be clear, about 98 percent of everything they say is either confused or muddled or just plain wrong (which is why this show is mostly a comedy). And yet, occasionally they hit on an eternal truth, like the quote above about the need to have someone to recognize your existence - so that when you die, when your tree metaphorically falls in the forest, someone does indeed hear it.
So there these two old guys are, trudging forward together, striving to find words to clarify the meaning of the 65-75 years they have spent on this earth, knowing that time in their cases is a very scarce resource and, like most of us, babbling a lot of B.S. to cover the fact that when you get right down to it, none of us really know anything.

This film is neither Screwball nor Romantic Comedy, but it's here on this blog because it is one of the Seven Wonders of Sturges. It belongs here out of respect if nothing else.
According to the lore on the Internets, Sturges sold this story as a package deal - the studio got a solid screenplay for $10 and he got to direct his first feature. If not for this Oscar winning screenplay there might not be as many as seven wonders, there might not be any. This is the start of Sturges as we know him.
Though without this film there could have been more plays. And maybe some Tony awards too.
Do you ever wonder about that? Are people of greatness simply "that way" from the get-go? Is it inevitable with some people? Like, their challenge is in choosing a path. (And by greatness I don't only mean big-shot screenwriters or Nobel Laureates, greatness can be a trusted veterinarian, respected school teacher, or top-notch butcher, baker, candlestick maker). Or is this an abjectly random world that allows individuals with much to contribute to slip through the cracks and spend their days unrealized and impotent?
At first glance, the second option sounds worse, but if the world is Laissez-faire, then a person always has a chance to grab at something. In option one, if you're not one of the chosen, you're screwed. But, absent predestination a person can always hope. Annoying,

In this introduction, Holliday T. Day and Hollister Sturges explain how the theme of “the fantastic” underlies the art of the twenty-nine artists included in the exhibition The Art of the Fantastic: Latin America, 1920-1987. In explaining their use of the idea of “the fantastic” as an organizing rubric for the exhibition, they distinguish “the fantastic” from European surrealism by stressing how, in Latin America it has evolved as a spontaneous, not intellectual, phenomenon in art. Day and Sturges identify six “cultural forces” that fostered “the fantastic” in Latin American art: the Catholic church, conquest and colonialism, pre-Columbian and African cultures, political oppression, contact with Europe and the U.S., and isolation. These themes, they explain, are “explored” by the artists (who represent “three generations”) featured in the exhibition.

Fair Field was built at a time when nothing had been constructed on the land between the hilltop and the lake except for Main Street which cut through the property. The mansion was built by Buckingham Sturges, brother of George Sturges, whose home, Snug Harbor, I wrote about last October. Click here to read post.
The 15-room mansion originally sat on a 20-acre plot, but by the time Buckingham passed away only six years later, the property line had extended to 65 acres.

Combined, those two films have a reported production budget of $1 billion.
The Russos have been in Park City this week for the Slamdance Film Festival, where they’ll reward a filmmaker with the new Russo Fellowship award. Speaking with them by phone recently, “Arrested Development” and “Infinity War” seemed fitting subjects. They told the Deseret News what it’s like to guide the world’s most expensive film franchise, and how “Arrested Development” shares some of the same DNA.
Those two projects exist in much different realms — one a low-budget cult classic, the other a gargantuan blockbuster — but as it turns out, Captain America and Michael Bluth are pretty similar.

As we enter the club, Roy Ayers, Bob Marley and Erykah Badu beam at us from a backlit mural. A noteworthy late-night addition, the Shrine (2109 S Wabash Ave) perfectly complements a string of recent dining offerings on the Wabash Avenue strip in the South Loop. The collage of more than 75 seminal album covers spans not only the Shrine’s 20-foot-long entryway but also the musical influences channeled into this venture, the latest from nightlife impresario Joe Russo.
One can’t help but notice that in the mural—a musical mission statement—the palest race is conspicuously absent. That’s no oversight: The Afro-centricity is central to the club’s theme. Kente-cloth-patterned wallpaper adorns the walls, while black-and-white photos of ’70s-chic, scantily clad Nubian models hang prominently above the main bar.

Not much is known about the plot for the sequel, but it has been said to concern the advent of drone combat and where actual fighter pilots stand in the face of the ever-increasing robotization of warfare.
Top Gun: Maverick is directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously worked with Cruise on 2013’s Oblivion, working from a screenplay by Peter Craig (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) alongside Eric Warren Singer and Justin Marks (Jungle Book). Jerry Bruckheimer is producing the film through his production company Jerry Bruckheimer Films for Paramount Pictures.

Retrieved Text: Fifteen years ago today, on May 12, 1995, the action flick Crimson Tide saw its release. Just five years after the release of The Hunt for Red October, the country was apparently hungry for another submarine movie. Directed by Tony Scott, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and with credited writers Michael Schiffer and Richard P. Henrick, the film starred Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. The intriguing part: Quentin Tarantino did a series of uncredited rewrites on the script (adding, no doubt, the Silver Surfer dialogue). I can't say that I was ever a fan of this film, and I have no memories of any kind associated with it.
But that must have been a heck of a weekend for Tarantino. That Friday, he saw the release of this film, and the night before, May 11, 1995, NBC aired the episode of "ER" he had directed (which we here at Chronological Snobbery recalled in some level of detail in yesterday's post).
On that fateful 1995 weekend, he was only 32 years old.
One of the greatest movies of all time. Sometimes I put it on and just listen to the audio and wonder if I will ever get to write something so perfect.
Tarantino also did the thinly veiled racist monologue about horses at the end -- that led to a confrontation with Denzel that ended with Denzel punching him in the face.
Or at least that's the story I heard.

Much of the credit goes to Paul McGuigan’s stylish direction which is so good that it makes you wonder why there are so many pedestrian films made. A good of credit should also go to Johnny Ferguson’s amped-up screenplay and the fine performances by the three leads, Malcolm McDowell, David Thewlis and Paul Bettany. Although McDowell gets top billing this is really Paul Bettany’s film whilst David Thewlis gives a solid and unusually restrained performance that counterbalances the familiarly thuggish ambiance.
The film opens potently with a Reservoir Dogs-like round table discussion amongst a troupe of aging East End crims recalling past times. The subject of Freddy Mays (Thewlis) comes up and this sets Malcolm McDowell’s character referred to in the credits as Gangster 55 to recalling his rise in Mays’ Kray-era gang. We then go into flash back and follow his story with Paul Bettany playing the McDowell character. Quite a few people will have difficultly accepting the casting of the handsome and refined looking Bettany playing a hard man, let alone McDowell's younger self, but he burns with the icily ambitious and sociopathic energy that the character requires. Set in the mid-60s, the production design is a treat, McGuigan’s direction dynamic and the use of incidental music excellent.

Every action movie needs a villain and in Solo: A Star Wars Story, Paul Bettany plays that role well. In Solo: A Star Wars Story, Bettany plays Dryden Vos a lavish criminal with a reputation for being ruthless. Bettany grew up watching Star Wars, he saw his first Star Wars film when he was a young boy in London. It was during a depressing time in London but Bettany found refuge in the Star Wars universe.
Years later he’s working on The Avengers and thinking about possibly putting the word out that he was interested in Star Wars but he figured it wouldn’t be possible since he already working on another project unless of course, Ron Howard is the director. As luck would have it, Howard signed on as a director and without missing a step, Bettany sent him a text message saying, “hey, Ron, have you ever spent long winter evenings, like I have to wonder why you’re not in

LOS ANGELES — In his new 3-D action film, Priest, Paul Bettany plays a laconic warrior with a cross tattooed on his face, a man who channels divine power to combat the vampire menace that terrorizes the citizens of a post-apocalyptic realm.
But it's not entirely new territory for the English actor, whose résumé includes A Knight's Tale, A Beautiful Mind and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.
In last year's Legion, Bettany starred as an avenging archangel determined to protect the life of an infant as doomsday dawns; in the blockbuster The Da Vinci Code, he portrayed a murderous albino monk whose extreme faith demands he whip himself bloody to atone for his sins.
So what exactly is it that draws Bettany to such dark, religious-themed fare?
"There was a friend of mine who is in the business who said, 'Paul, you're never going to be an action hero.' I went, 'Right,' and went down to the gym. It was that sort of binary and punklike," said the actor, who described his role in Priest as "almost entirely physical. "You make a few decisions about the inner life of the character, but really, what it's about is how he looks, and he's got to look like an action hero. The discipline is getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go work out."

If you're in the mood for a romantic comedy this fall, then maybe Wimbledon is the movie for you. Starring Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany, this flick is about a washed-up tennis player who gets one last shot at playing at Wimbledon. I know, you're thinking, 'Why would I want to watch a movie about tennis?' Well, check out Kidzworld's review to find out!
There's just something about a British accent that gets your heart fluttering, and there are plenty of accents in this film. Paul Bettany is kind of bumbling and awkward in his attempts to win Kirsten Dunst over (like a school boy going in for his first kiss), that it's hard not to root for him. There's plenty of breath-taking scenery and enough quick wit to keep you giggling. Wimbledon also keeps you on your toes with all of its suspenseful sports moments. Who knew tennis could be so exciting?
The biggest problem with Wimbledon is that it's a bit too predictable. There are no real good twists, but all of the characters in the movie are really likable, so the predictability factor won't really matter that much.
On the Wimbldon DVD there are some cute featurettes about how the movie was made, and how the special effects in the movie were created. You might not think that a sports movie would have too many special effects, but this cool featurette shows

Paul Bettany and Rebecca Hall in "Transcendence"
April 18, 2014 by Warner Bros.
As my husband and I trucked up Broadway toward our subway stop after our screening of Transcendence, he said, "The problem is he did what she wanted, but he didn't ask her about it first."
"So this is a movie about communicating better with your wife?" I asked.
"Did we really need IMAX for that?" I asked him. He shrugged.
It's not a bad movie, by a long shot. In fact, it has all the trappings of a good movie: great talent (Johnny Depp, Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Kate Mara), carefully framed scenes—Wally Pfister, the director, is best known for being Christopher Nolan's cinematographer—and an interesting plot that hits at the core of things we're interested in right now.
After all, this is the second movie in six months in major release that features a human in a close, even intimate relationship with artificial intelligences (the other was Spike Jonze's Her, winner of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay this year).
It's also got something very strange and interesting going on beneath the surface. More on that anon.
The thing about science fiction, good science fiction, is that you've got basically two directions in which it can go. One is to go heavy on plot, playing the story as a cautionary tale about the danger of some kind of human activity taken too far (genetic modification, technology, take your pick). Think

Quentin Tarantino, Slavery, and guns what’s not to love. If there’s anything I love more than a good movie its a good movie that is also controversial. I was excited to see Django already but the outrage from the trailer and the line “Kill white people and get paid for it? What’s not to like?” as well as Spike Lee’s very vocal disdain for the movie pretty much guaranteed that I would see Django at midnight.
If you haven’t ever seen a Quentin Tarantino movie then you’re either in for a great treat or a very rude awakening. This stylized western takes everything people love (and everything they hate) about Tarantino and puts it on display unapologetic and unabashedly. The fight scenes are at times drawn out and are certainly over the top, but considering its a Tarantino film tame and much more realistic than earlier movies such as Kill Bill. This movie was not perfect however the performances by many of the supporting cast were lacking like that from Kerry Washington for example. I think we were supposed to believe that Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) was just as strong willed as Django (Jamie Foxx) but it was hard to feel anything for her character but pity.

Retrieved Text: Woody Allen's new comedy, Midnight in Paris, is a charming bit of romantic piffle. Not romance as in relationship, but the wistful, sentimental and fanciful thinking that plagues its protagonist, Gil (Owen Wilson). Gil is a successful Hollywood hack, but he suffers from "Golden Age thinking" and longs to be a real writer, working in a better time.
He's visiting Paris with his unsentimental fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and -- as luck would have it -- a wormhole in the shape of a vintage Peugeot transports him each night back to the 1920s. Soon, he's drinking with the Fitzgeralds and Hemingway; showing his novel to Gertrude Stein; and falling for one of Picasso's lovers (Marion Cotillard). Plenty of in-jokes here for those who know their Paris salon history.
The shaggy, effervescent Midnight is an unabashed valentine to Paris, if only its most attractive parts. Like many of Allen's films, it concerns a rarefied world of amusing intellectuals, artists, bon vivants and pre-war interiors that must be perpetually defended from boors and bores.
Yes, Midnight is a sentimental fantasia about romanticizing the past. But it's upfront and openly self-referential about its artifice and self-indulgence, so it's hard not to fall under its bubbly spell.

Unfortunately, the end result is more soporific than soulful — meaning that all Vandross ends up with is the quiet-storm equivalent of elevator music.
It’s not as if he’s loafing, mind you. Some of what he does is amazing, like the shimmering vibrato that highlights the tag line in “Hustle” or the angelic ascent of the climax of “Too Far Down.” This is world-class singing, and Vandross makes it all the more impressive by tossing such tricks off without even breaking a sweat.
Never Let Me Go isn’t a total failure — Marcus Miller’s string-popping bass line on “Heaven Knows” briefly rouses Vandross from his torpor, and the Philly-style “Can’t Be Doin’ That Now” shows occasional signs of life.

So it was with Sam who fought for human rights and human dignity throughout his long career—but don’t mistake me—he fought as a poet with discipline, intellect, and yes, with soul. He was the pacifist’s pacifist.

It's as if Allen has decided that near enough is good enough. He's famous for making a movie a year; after so many great films, that may now be too often.
You'll end up feeling about the film like Bobby about Los Angeles -- "half-bored, half-fascinated." And that's a pretty poor average, even for two poorly stitched-together films.
Allen's script throws together familiar elements (ruthless hoodlums, respectable hypocrites, insecure film buffs) but lacks pace, belly-laughs or texture.
Cafe Society is mainly a small and unnervingly familiar private drama that is never funny enough nor smart enough to justify its anachronistic style.
The costumes and production design are impeccable and it is a pleasant enjoyable story of old town Hollywood.
Effortlessly well-made cinematic comfort food at its warmest.
The period detail of locations and costumes is faultless.

CAFÉ SOCIETY is so many things combined into one stellar picture that makes you love being in love with the movies again.
Woody Allen is a great filmmaker and there is no fault with him sticking to subjects he's familiar with. But in Cafe Society, his refusal to do anything new with his thematic obsessions grows boring really quickly.

My friend and I reminisced about how we used to spend this holiday many moons ago as we were doing what we do now instead. Then I got a little older, a stranger vomited on my shoes at a bar (true story) and I came to view St. Patrick's Day with the same disgust I hold for New Year's Eve. Piffle! Who wants to be out with the masses for amateur hour at the bar?
This friend and I have known each other since kindergarten. Instead of keeping a shine on the bar with the sleeves of our coats and jigging until we fall over, we took our gaggle of girls to Disney on Ice's Rockin' Ever After. Good time for us? Well, it was something. Good time for the girls? They're probably still smiling in their sleep. Many years from now, they'll probably spend St. Patrick's Day the way we did in days gone by, dancing and laughing until side-stepping the vomit becomes too much. I hope we're helping them build the kind of dear friendships that will take them through the all the ages and stages of their lives.

Let’s take a look at the top Disney movies of the ’70s and reminisce the good old days.
The Aristocats is an animated romantic comedy, adventure, and musical film that was released in 1970. It is the 20th animated film that Disney released. It is directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and it featured the voices of Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Roddy Maude-Roxby, and Scatman Crothers. The Aristocats is about a family of aristocratic cats who was kidnapped by their butler to gain his mistress’s money and how an alley cat befriends them and helped them escape the evil butler. The Aristocrats was the last movie project that Walt Disney approved before his death in December of 1966.
Robin Hood was an animated comedy adventure film that was released in 1973. It was Disney’s 21st animated film. It was again directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and it featured the voices of Phil Harris, Peter Ustinov, Carole Shelley, Andy Devine, Monica Evans, Terry-Thomas, and Pat Buttram. Robin Hood tells the adventures of Robin Hood, his friend Little John, and the people of Nottingham as they stood against the excessive taxation rules of Prince John. Robin Hood received positive reviews during its release and critics praised the animation, voice cast and the humor of the film.

The good news for consumers is that there are actually only four separate Blu-rays to purchase in order to collect them all, thanks to the super-bargain, triple-feature that includes Dragon (perversely relegated to “bonus feature” status) with Fun and Fancy Free and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949) on the same disc. There’s also Disney Renaissance features Hercules (1997) and Tarzan (1999). We’ll take a look at all of them.
Leading the pack with ease is the 1971 live-action/animated spectacular Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Working a general formula meant to mimic the blockbuster success of Mary Poppins, Bedknobs wasn’t the box office sensation it was intended to be. But this surprisingly edgy (for Disney family fare, that is) fantasy is rooted in a historically important chapter of World War II, as the Nazis seemingly unstoppable Blitz trudged forward into Great Britain. A witch-in-training, Ms. Price (note-perfect Angela Lansbury) must care for a trio of lovable orphans (no sarcasm intended; Ian Weighill, Cindy O’Callaghan, and Roy Snart are charming and funny) while seeking the missing text to a spell that will allow her to instigate the “substitutiary locomotion” needed to bring down the invading army.

That was the question that was put to my children by Memory Foam Warehouse this weekend. To give the children inspiration they sent us a huge parcel of snacks, a pad of paper and an art set, and a copy of the 1971 children's classic - Bedknobs And Broomsticks.
Then we got out the brand new art set and the boys drew pictures of exactly where they'd want to go if they had a magic bed that could fly..
My 5 year old took it very seriously. He decided that his magic bed would take him somewhere very real - the jungle! He started with a tiger and trees, then added monkeys swinging from vines. Then he drew himself on the magic bed - complete with magic bedknob and patterned duvet - I was very impressed.
My 3 year old wanted to draw a jungle like his brother, but when he started it turned into a space scene - which is far more his usual sort of storyline, and I was pleased because it's much better to use your own imagination.
Although he managed to draw on his face, hands and neck with 3 different felt tips before I put them away, my 3 year old's picture was all in orange "because it's the best".

This 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray edition highlights why that may be the case.
On the surface, this is a story of orphan Pete and his only friend, a protective dragon. Watching the movie as a kid, I accepted that premise at face value. As an adult, it comes across as a story of an abused boy who’s sold into slavery and runs away to the small seaside village of Passamaquoddy where he’s taken in by Nora (singer Helen Reddy) who’s nursing a broken heart following the death of her financeé a year earlier. These days Nora maintains the town lighthouse, where she lives with dad Lampie (Mickey Rooney, The Year Without a Santa Claus), the town drunk.
Those plot threads are more than enough to get us through a film, but Pete’s Dragon throws in another subplot featuring charlatan Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale, Pushing Daisies)

In the 1980s and 1990s, Hawk almost single-handedly transformed skateboarding from a kids' parking-lot pastime into a respected sport. He won virtually every skateboarding competition he entered, and before he was twenty, he was considered to be the number one vertical skateboarder in the world.
Hawk was equally talented off the ramp. His business ventures and product endorsements have made him a very wealthy man, and have also kept him in the spotlight. As skateboarding icon Stacy Peralta told Sports Illustrated, "Tony is the first skateboarder who has given the world a face to put on the sport. He has become a part of American pop culture."
When Anthony Frank Hawk was born on May 12, 1968, his parents could not have realized that skateboarding was eventually going to become such an integral part of their lives. As Hawk readily admitted in his autobiography, he was a "hyperactive demon child" who regularly terrorized his babysitters, his teachers, and his parents. He was very bright, with an IQ of 144, but he was also frustrated and unfocused, and would frequently fly into rages. His father, Frank, a retired U.S. Navy officer and small appliance salesman, and his mother, Nancy, a homemaker and part-time business teacher, were equally frustrated about what to do with their youngest child. When Hawk was eight, his older brother Steve bought him, on a whim, a blue fiberglass hand-me-down skateboard, and his

What got you into riding? I played team sports when I was a kid. One of my friends on the football team I played for pretty much got me into riding. I had seen it on tv before. So I had a general idea of what BMX was. I just got hooked after the first day of riding trails.
What inspires you to ride? Just the overall feeling. I love the feeling of moving the bike around and I love the feeling of progression and accomplishing.

It was the culminating event in the four day contest that drew 68,000 fans to Aspen, Colo. Once again, White delivered. He ripped off a stellar final run that included back-to-back 1080s (three complete rotations in the air) to win the gold.
White's payday for winning one of his sport's biggest competitions: a paltry $30,000. By comparison, Geoff Ogilvy earned $1.1 million for winning golf's 2009 opening event, the Mercedes-Benz Championship.
But the snowboarding and skateboarding phenom crowned the Flying Tomato will get his money. We estimate that White earned $9 million in 2008 thanks to lucrative endorsement deals with Burton, Hewlett-Packard , Oakley , Red Bull and Target . His earnings are almost entirely from sponsors, as yearly prize money for skateboarders and snowboarders rarely tops $100,000. White's endorsement take is greater than any baseball or football player outside of quarterback Peyton Manning.
White is the Tiger Woods of today's action sports stars. He wins more than anybody else, and his fame far eclipses that of his competition. Other action sports stars are starting to get noticed by a broader audience, and that has meant bigger paychecks, thanks to rich sponsorship deals.
With this in mind, we decided to take a look at who makes what in action sports. Through interviews with industry experts we estimated 2008 earnings for the top stars in the more traditional sports like snowboarding, skateboarding, surfing and

The Harry Potter universe is full of plenty of amazing creatures, spells, objects, and of course, people. After all, what would these movies be without the fantastic characters giving us some of the most incredible performances possible? From Slytherins to Hufflepuffs, Ministry workers to members of the Order of the Phoenix, these are the characters who brought to life the amazing wizarding world of Harry Potter. But with so many characters appearing over the span of eight movies, who can possibly remember all of them?

Children, dressed in school attire similar to that worn by the characters in the series, huddled around tables and took part in a variety of crafts and games.

“We also did our ‘Owl Exams,’ which consisted of Harry Potter-themed word searches, matching puzzles, trivia questions and more. The kids got to design their own housing crests and they made owl cupcakes, like Harry’s feathered, flying companion, Hedwig,” said Carpino.
Liam Moulton, a 7-year-old Harry Potter enthusiast, said he came to the free event to have fun.
“I’ve read two of the books so far, and I’ve seen all the movies. My favorite one is ‘Deathly Hallows,’ ” Liam said.

Nearly every shot in this new movie contains one glory or another.
"The Strange Case of Angelica" tells its tale of love and death with a captivating mix of formality, ambiguity and offbeat humor. On the surface a simple fable, it's actually much more.
Because of his age and experience, de Oliveira brings a wider perspective to everything he shoots; if he places his camera in the middle of a street, he tries to convey the way it was decades ago, not just how it is now.
The film should have been called 'The Strange Case of Isaac' and admitted its true direction.

This whimsical, ethereal tale of love and death is as light as a feather, but charming in its own way.
An old-fashioned 21st Century movie.
Some dreamlike photography and a soothing musical score are pluses but slow, draggy telling is likely to frustrate the viewer.

The film is held together by a weighty central performance from Charlton Heston. His silent work is as compelling as his arrogant grumblings on the ills of man. These elements combined with some of the strangest fusions of image and sound, and you have some compelling imagery that startles the senses and sits alongside the ideas. It is a film that emphatically transcends the genre in a year where it unquestionably took a paradigm shift.
The 1970 follow-up is interesting in the layers that it adds to the original picture. This is evident with the addition of a third race. They are telepathic humans who reside in the Forbidden Zone and ultimately believe that they are peaceful, despite what they do with the power of suggestion. Their insertion creates an interesting conflict for the Apes, and the majesty of their kin is illustrated with great, elaborate production design. Furthermore, the film retains some of the exploration, horror and social commentary of the original 68 film. However, all these ideas ultimately lack cohesion in a movie that is frustrating with its maddening mix of inadequate film-making, rushed storytelling and engaging imagery and scope.

It’s also a movie that I just can’t get excited about, because there’s not a whole lot — from plot to depth — beneath that surface sheen of elegance. The film is more concerned about mood than anything else and if you’re able to give yourself up to it, there’s a lot to be taken from The Red Turtle.

Unlike Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire gives Cruise something to work with... He takes to it with zest.

It sort of feels sacrilegious in browbeating what appears to be an innocuous children’s animated film about a young girl’s wild imagination to offset some personalised pain as she pals around with fuzzy animals in a surreal amusement park. This is indeed the foundation for the flimsy kiddie fantasy ‘Wonder Park’ that trivialises the instilled grief of a youngster while paddling this trite treat with bouncy beasts and an A-list cast of voiceover artists contributing to this flappy farce. Predictable, lazy-minded, manipulative and tediously annoying, ‘Wonder Park’ is a forgettable tots’ tale that tries to mean well but is as inviting as a closed carnival attraction under repair.
Although openly energetic and pushing the right buttons when highlighting the usual trapping of an escapist animated fable, ‘Wonder Park’ feels rather clumsy in its bid to parlay a young girl named June’s (Brianna Denski) odd behavior into a head-scratching stretch of creativity and imagination to mask away some embedded conflict. This amiable puff-piece for the youngster crowd may be appealing for its suggestive sweetness, gimmickry of talking animals and the overall joy of carefree craziness that besets the realm of a colorful journey.
However, this mishmash of production is deemed aimless. Also, it is strangely borderline as being dismissive and insulting in its misguided message about handling youth-oriented crisis. Inexplicably, the aforementioned voice work from such notable names as Jennifer Garner, John Oliver, Kenan

I’ve never read The Dark Tower but have always been vaguely familiar with some of the story elements and concepts. With King’s track record, I went into the film adaptation of his 1982 novel with modest optimism.
The Dark Tower film tells the story of a boy named Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) who begins having visions of a parallel world. In those visions, Jake sees that a man in black (Matthew McConaughey) is kidnapping psychic children and trying to use them to destroy the dark tower that protects each world from a realm of evil monsters. Once he realizes his visions are real, Jake journeys into the parallel world and joins forces with Roland (Idris Elba), the last remaining gunslinger charged with protecting the tower.

Some of the best movies in the history of cinema were set in a room. Great actors, amazing dialogues and oftentimes sweltering, frightening atmosphere. Remember Cube (1997)? If anything, the suffocating movie surely gave a couple ideas to escape game creators. Clue (1985) was one of the predecessors of escape games: in a strange, creepy house, the guests are invited to solve a murder mystery. Wolfgang Petersen’s masterpiece, Das Boot (1981) was shot in a suffocating submarine, while Panic Room (2002) is one of the latest piece in the series of these unique movies. These pieces of brilliant filmmaking have definitely paved the way for the escape room industry.
We love these films and we love playing escape games. Many enthusiasts have been dreaming of a movie that is set in an escape room. Hundreds of themes, hundreds of possibilities. If you’ve played escape games, you surely know the feeling: it would take minutes to write an exciting script right after you’ve escaped a room. Playing puzzles has already inspired people from all over the world to write articles, blogs and create their own version of games. The industry now indeed covers many areas, but feature films have been missing from the list.
When cinema meets escape rooms, it’s an exciting marriage of magic worlds. Boundaries between reality and fiction become

I have weird taste. I love pulp, but I love heart, and I love a movie well done. In light of that, here are my top nine movies of 2013. Some movies didn’t make the cut. I really liked 12 Years a Slave for what it managed to do, that is create a story about slavery was genuinely moving yet not a white guilt tract.

This movie will surprise you. It seems like an über macho racing flick. What it is is a slick drama, with more time spent on the emotional lives of the drivers than the race track. What we end up with is an engaging, beautifully shot film. And c’mon man, F1 cars are great.
There’s a lot to be said about this movie, especially because it says so little. It’s a quiet film about relationships that’s gorgeously shot. It sticks to you not because a lot happens, but because it feels so true to life.
I like Shakespeare. I like Joss Whedon. That combined with a fantastic cast (Clark Gregg and Amy Acker and Nathan Fillion and Sean Maher and Ashley Johnson and BriTANick!?) yields a really fun interpretation of the play.

I really wanted to like this film cause there are actually some pretty cool elements. Though the disappointments and the inexplicable story turns until I just surrendered and admitted that this was a good-looking clunker.
This movie was only about 1 hour and 26 minutes, which is such a short time limit for a big-budget movie like this.

The withdrawn, twentysomething Mozes (Marton Kristof) tries to readjust at home after an extended stay at a mental hospital. His old man, Janos (Laszlo Galffi), is an apparently tenderhearted pastor who runs several local initiatives, including a reintegration program for former addicts and couples counseling sessions for his parishioners. He is the kind of father who’s not too shy to say he’s missed his son, though Janos’s words and his actions frequently seem out of sync, at least when it comes to his own offspring. Despite the somewhat caricatured females in the family — Mozes’s aunt (Eszter Csakanyi) and mother (Krisztina Kinczli) throw a tantrum when the returnee announces he’s become a vegetarian — the early going almost feels like a Dardenne film set on the Hungarian plains: social realism with just a faint whiff of the darkly absurd.
But when Janosz drops dead at the exact moment a Jesus statue accidentally falls off a cart and hits the ground — the odd synchronicity beautifully captured by resourceful d.p. Gergely Poharnok— out goes any pretense of realism and Poharnok ushers in a style that’s part sweet if supernatural father-son fable, part deadpan comedy (the latter inaugurated when a white dove at Janos’s funeral refuses to fly, prompting the pastor to try to launch it into the sky).

The plot revolving around what Peter's father did never really feels like it works, nor does his father's explanation for why Peter would have gotten his abilities while anyone else wouldn't. The movie is an exercise in waste, and as well fails to bring anything truly new to the table.

Given that the original animated classic clocked in at just over an hour, there was plenty of space for an update to spread its own wings, or ears. Unfortunately, director Tim Burton never quite seemed sure which direction to take his adaptation in.
Burton’s Dumbo starts off on the right foot, evoking nostalgic memories of the original circus. The sight of the seminal Casey Jr. Circus Train is immediately contrasted with the dour state of the Medici Brothers’ Circus, facing financial problems in a post-World-War 1 America. Danny Devito was perfectly cast as owner/ringmaster Max Medici, in search of a marquee act to keep his troupe afloat. While this dilemma could have easily served as the main plot point for the film, Burton had loftier expectations, to the film’s detriment.
In the absence of talking animals, Colin Farrell is tasked with anchoring the moral heart of the film. Farrell’s Holt Farrier and his two children are perfectly serviceable voices for the titular elephant, but the emphasis on their family crisis simply isn’t as interesting as anything involving Dumbo. CGI Dumbo is adorable, but he’s weirdly often not the focus of his own movie.

Vampire stories are almost completely played out these days. Between TV shows and movies, there’s far from a shortage of media about blood-suckers at a viewer’s disposal. But still, that saturation doesn’t mean those stories can’t be entertaining when done well. Dave Schultz’s Rufus isn’t anything revolutionary in terms of vampire movies, but it’s still handled in an interesting way, full of intrigue, mystery, and emotion.
Rufus tells the story of a vampire (Rory Saper) left alone in a small town, trying to fit in and not allow anyone to find out what he is. He is taken in by the sheriff (David James Elliot) and the sheriff’s wife (Kelly Rowan) after his traveling companion is struck by a truck.

He said he mistakenly believed that recent changes in D.C. law made it legal for him to store unloaded guns there.
Arenas said he took the unloaded guns out of his locker on Dec. 21 "in a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate." He denied threatening or assaulting anyone. The New York Post has reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton drew guns on each other.
Two officials within the league who have been briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press on Saturday that the incident stemmed from a dispute over card-playing gambling debts and a heated discussion in the locker room.
The other player involved is Javaris Crittenton. His agent, Mark Bartelstein, said earlier Monday that his client did nothing wrong.
It was unclear whether Crittenton also planned to meet with authorities about the incident. His lawyer, Peter White, is on vacation and said he would not be at any meetings Monday or Tuesday.
Arenas also apologized for his actions in the statement.

Before I say anything else, I want to point out that my experience in comedy is limited. I did relatively minimal comedy before coming to New York and I’ve been here for just over half a year. So, in terms of the East/West differences I’m writing about, they only come from my limited personal experiences, which I suppose could have been different for anyone.
I went to college in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I fashioned together a ragtag (I don’t think that term actually means anything) group of students who wanted to do stand up comedy. I knew absolutely nothing about comedy at the time. We formed a bunch who got to perform at least once a week together at the campus coffee house or whatever other open mic or school event was going on. And at the time, once a week seemed like a lot.
The comics who I met at school were smart and silly. They wrote clever jokes and ridiculous ones, and that’s the vibe I got from the Bay in general. Accepting of the pensive and the weird; people in the Bay like different humor. San Francisco is different.

The inspiration for today’s puzzle, constructed by David Steinberg and Bruce Leban, came from a quip that Bruce delivered at the National Puzzlers’ League convention. The pair was able to work this joke into a puzzle, and you will find it spread across four entries in today’s grid.
Leaving the theme aside for a moment, the puzzle lived up to a Thursday-level of trickiness. There were precious few giveaways in the fill, with entries like ZANTAC, HEINE and ENAMELER requiring a lot of time to figure out.
At 5 Down, referring to a “pen” as a SLAMMER was a devious example of misdirection, and it only becomes clear when you cross-reference it with CELLMATE at 9 Down.
My favorite clue was “Graduate of Mount Holyoke, e.g.” at 11 Down. I had no idea what their school mascot was, so I was waiting for some crossers to bail me out until it dawned on me that they meant an ALUMNA of the famously all-female school.
This puzzle had its origins at a dinner table conversation at the National Puzzlers’ League annual convention last year. I repeated the joke and David counted letters in his head and announced that it could almost be split into four 15s. With an assist from Stanley Newman, sitting in between us, it fit exactly and David and I agreed to collaborate, with Stanley bowing out.

In Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , it goes on for as long as the opening credits need it to, which is about five minutes. So, how much you’ll get out of the film may depend on how long you can stomach a joke for.

Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen broke a lot of hearts when they opted not to reprise their shared role as Michelle Tanner on Fuller House. But it's creator Jeff Franklin who gets the last laugh.
In the very first episode of the Netflix series, Stephanie asks about the whereabouts of her little sis, and Danny responds with one of the episode's best zingers. "Well, Michelle sends her love," he says, "But she's busy in New York, running her fashion empire."
Cue the epic moment when the entire cast turns toward the studio audience and affects a mock frown for the cameras. They break the fourth wall to shade the Olsens.
The decision to shade MK+A in the first episode was easy. Franklin knew he had to address the awkward situation. However, finding the appropriate gag was slightly more challenging -- after all, he wanted the moment to be playful, not hurtful.
"We had a bunch of options on how to handle that moment," Franklin told MTV News. "And that was by far the funniest and the most unexpected, so that's what we went with. It made me laugh really hard. I love that joke. I hope the Olsen twins love it too because it's meant to be a playful moment."

1. Ensure that your dice are properly cared for. If you're going to be rolling a die ten, twenty, thirty times a night then you have to ensure that it's in good condition. Chips, bits of dirt, and even saliva from that foul girlfriend of yours can cause the die to fail a true roll. So before each game be sure to wash your dice with a coarse cloth and cool, soapy water. Then rinse it completely under warm water. Make sure that there's plenty of time for them to dry or your rolls will fail to provide you with your desired result.
2. Always use proper form when rolling. At the table you'll find different techniques for rolling and I cannot stress this enough: most of them are wrong. A proper roll begins with the die placed in the center of your palm. Next you should lay your pinky flat against your palm and each of your remaining fingers should be loosely laid on top in a stair like fashion. Now gently shake the dice in your hand four times to ensure that it has begun to move in a random, yet controlled, manner. On the fourth shake, release the die onto the table allowing it to come to a rest. If done correctly

It's not just a looping blade or blocking blade it's a mix of both. Garaydia ALC match perfectly with T05 rubbers, however it will work well with any medium-hard EURO/JAP rubbers. I tried some tacky chineese on forehand (untuned) and they were hard to use due to throw not the speed. Blade has medium throw so anything with medium-high throw will work. Perfect blade for blocking it's as stable as Viscaria and has even more crisp touch. With poly ball I would bet it's one of the most controllable offensive blade for all-around offensive game. You can execute all shots with this blade it shine near to the table, thanks to crisp direct feel. You can block hard attack with slightly closed head (T05max on BH) and vary the pace of ball. Loops look perfectly same if you got right techinque. If you are Tenergy user and poly ball made you mad, maybe Garaydia ALC is the answer, it's just perfect with them. You can't go wrong with this blade. It's premium offensive blade with great control not so springy but has a kick if you want it, very linear, straight and direct.

But, the effect on your audience can be devastating. Not only are fillers annoying, they can leave your audience with the perception that you're nervous or lack confidence. And, maybe that's true!
But by pausing more often, instead of uttering meaningless words or sounds, you'll appear less nervous and more confident—lending credibility to your message.
In every day conversation, when relaxed, you might occasionally use an "um" or a filler word. But, I'm betting you also pause at the end of a sentence or thought, to give your listener a chance to consider what you've said or respond.
During a presentation, it's important to give your audience that same opportunity to process and reflect. Here are some tips to help you pause more effectively.
Practice your presentation out loud and consciously pause at the end of every sentence for three seconds. Make sure it's a full three seconds. While the length is exaggerated, you'll become aware of the pause!
Record yourself practicing and play it back. Note the pauses and rate of speech. Is it too fast? Too slow? Too many filler words or sounds? Adjust accordingly and record again.
Get honest feedback from a friend or colleague who has heard you present. What do they think? Should you slow down? Pause more often?
Pausing gives your audience time to process the information they're receiving. Equally important, it allows you to

I've come to realize that among some endurance riders, the WHOA is highly underrated. A lot of horses learn to GO before they learn how to WHOA. Sometimes it's just easier to let the horse go fast than to take the time to teach him (or keep reinforcing, if the horse is not a fast learner) the WHOA before you let him GO. The riders hang on the horse's mouth, which makes him harder-mouthed, and less likely to respond by slowing down when you pull.
Just going fast can be fun, but if the horse is too young to be going too fast too soon, or if he's coming back from an injury, or if he's the kind of horse that isn't smart enough to slow down on his own when he needs a breather, it can be very destructive. Some horses are hardwired to go fast till they drop. Some horses just have no brakes. It can be especially detrimental to you and your horse if a whoa is needed quickly but there are no brakes.
Sometimes, when your horse is out of control, or when he has no brakes, or when fighting with him isn't getting him to slow down and it's wearing both of you out, it's time to stop what you're doing, and go back to basics.

Intuitively this doesn't make sense, but if we think about it a little more deeply, it does.
Like humans, a horses final time is a representation of their internal fractions, where even ones are relaxed and comfortable, stops and starts, fast and slow, are uncomfortable. Physics taught us that in high school. In general, in route races, the larger the variance between internal quarters, the less efficient the energy use. Horses - no matter what fractions the leader puts up - who "run their race" will have a better final time.

I'm not going to make this long, because it's really not that difficult. We've always been offended. This isn't new. The truth is that many of us grew so used to being offended that it turned into a sort of resigned indifference.
In other words, when gay people would watch a popular TV show in the 90s and the heteronormative characters would make a gay joke, we would simply wave it off and ignore it. We knew it was offensive. We also knew we couldn't do anything to change it.

Hong Kong action-crime maestro Johnnie To makes films about good and evil, but he's not in the habit of neatly distinguishing the two. So he might seem at a disadvantage in mainland China, where the censors don't tolerate moral ambiguity. With the canny Drug War, however, the director proves himself entirely up to the challenge.
To's first action movie to be shot on the mainland, Drug War is clearly an animal different from his Hong Kong pictures. The open highways and high-speed trains of infrastructure-happy China replace the crowded streets of the director's claustrophobic hometown, and the story's apparent hero is a police captain without the quirks and complications of To's usual cops. But a scriptwriting team that includes co-producer and longtime collaborator Wai Ka-Fai takes the story in satisfyingly unexpected directions.
The opening set piece involves several vehicles: a careening car, a weaving truck and a bus full of anxious downscale travelers. The passengers are drug mules, with balloons full of contraband in their digestive tracts. The truck is carrying the raw materials to make methamphetamine, and is erratically piloted by two guys who've been sampling the wares.
The car, meanwhile, is under the control, just barely, of Timmy Choi (Louis Koo), a Hong Kong hood fleeing a meth lab that just exploded. The blast left him both woozy and singed, and three

Our friends are at odds with each other, as half want to protect him and half are hired to kill him, but the fact that he has a wife (Josie Ho) and a month-old son tips the team down the righteous path.

But more than that, THE MISSION was exceptional due to the way Johnnie To framed the action in that film: Instead of the "bullet ballet" of so many movies, To framed the action in a more static way, with an almost geometric precision. Action took place in clearly defined spaces and each actor in the action had a clear location within the space, the position and angle of attack being more important than gunplay theatrics.

An event of 1861 received little notice at the time but was to have a lasting influence -- the birth of the first Hawaiian nationalist newspaper.
The first Hawaiian newspaper appeared in 1834 but was produced by American Protestant missionaries. In 1861, Chief David Kalākaua backed Ka Hoku o Ka Pakipika, "The Star of the Pacific." This was the start of a press produced entirely by Native Hawaiians. Editors and printers were prominent and educated men and women, the men trained at Lāhainaluna School on Maui, the Kamehameha School for Boys, and on other newspapers, and the women learning on the job with editor-husbands. Kalākaua, who sponsored a number of journals, was affectionately called "Editor King" by his people.
The newspapers took up such topics as the decline of the native population, the need for Hawaiian sovereignty, the value of the monarchy, and issues of land and water. They covered news from home and abroad, wrote up descriptions of the culture and customs of the land, and promoted the use of the Hawaiian language.
Ka Hoku was the forerunner of some sixty papers, including: "Ke Aloha Aina," The Hawaiian Patriot; "Holomua Hawai‘i," Hawaiian Progress; and "Ka Lahui Hawai‘i," The Voice of the Nation. Their descendants are the Hawaiian newspapers of today, like the "Native Hawaiian", produced by Alu Like, and "Ka Wai Ola o OHA,"The Living Waters of OHA.

NOVEMBER 3, 1997: What's so great about Wong Kar-Wai? That's what I wondered when the Hong Kong filmmaker's Chungking Express reached these shores two years ago, when everyone from movie populist Quentin Tarantino (who shepherded the film's US release) to the academics at Film Comment hailed Wong as the next Godard. Sure, Wong and cinematographer Christopher Doyle had style to burn, and Wong was capable of blending gritty film noir conventions with more rarefied art-film philosophizing (though I found his mix used the most inconsequential elements of both). Most of all, Wong had a feeling for the rhythms of city life, especially the all-night metropolis of Hong Kong. But when a city is your protagonist, the human characters can get lost. Wong's follow-up film, Fallen Angels (to be released in America next spring), is essentially Chungking Express all over again, with all the good and bad that implies.
Now comes Happy Together, which finds Wong in self-imposed exile in Buenos Aires and his focus narrowed down to just two (sometimes three) characters. His theme of loneliness and missed connections is distilled down to its bitterest, most human essence. It's a wrenching movie, and a good one.
The film is narrated by Lai Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung), who's musing over his break-up with Ho Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung). The two men had moved from Hong Kong to Argentina, only to find that the alien land exacerbated their differences.

Both Hilda, a 2014 dramedy about a young, mestiza nanny who is held captive by her white employer, and Muchachas, Juliana Fanjul’s 2017 documentary on maids in Mexico City, have zeroed in on the divide between household worker and employer. Lila Avilés’s La Camarista, released earlier this year, highlights the daily life of hospitality employees in her documentary-style depiction of a hotel chambermaid. In most of these films, directors have explored questions of class and race, albeit from a perspective “limited by their material interests and social class,” as María Mercedes Vázquez Vázquez, author of The Question of Class in Contemporary Latin American Cinema, has told Remezcla. This growing trend in cinema grapples with tangled, complex social dynamics from a familiar, domestic space.
Even a well-intentioned film can perpetuate tropes of maids and nannies as meek, petty, and unremarkable. “They’re not Mary Poppins. They tend to come from a poor educational background,” Sebastian Silva, the director of La Nana (2009), a Chilean movie inspired by his experience with live-in maids, said nine years ago. “They take care of you, feed you, dress you, but they don’t teach you.” That attitude bleeds into the film, which often portrays the family maid, Raquel (Catalina Saavedra), as a stubborn and irascible caregiver, who locks every nanny hired to help her out of the house, and at one point even throws the family’s cat over the fence to sabotage one of them.

Previously, the studio had reached out to every other actress working today—from Sandra Bullock to Blake Lively—but Angelina was far and above their favorite, which is why they reached out twice. Now the question remains, without the most beautiful woman in the world onboard, will Warner Bros. be willing to throw $80 million at Gravity? Or is Gravity's future, more likely, now in jeopardy?
I would, in all seriousness, watch anything and anyone directed by Alfonso Cuarón: the man has never disappointed as a director. In fact, his disappointments (Great Expectations) are at worst ‘just plain good.’ He has made beautiful children’s fantasy tales (A Little Princess, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), he has made powerful and personal art-house films (Y tu mamá también), and, I repeat, he has made my favorite sci-fi film of the past ten years—if not longer—Children of Men.

For the first few minutes, Ruizpalacios focuses on a harried mother as she tries to quiet her screaming baby and get dressed for work, all while the phone rings incessantly and she nurses a black eye. Güeros isn’t about the mother, who’s never seen in the film again. It’s about a teenage boy, Tomás (played by Sebastián Aguirre) who hits her with a water balloon as soon as she steps out of her apartment. Like Cuarón’s film, Güeros understands how young people can get so caught up in their own little adventures and dramas that they become grossly inconsiderate.
Ruizpalacios has described Güeros as a road movie that never leaves town. Set in 1999—during a lengthy student strike provoked by the state raising tuition at the National University from a token two cents to an actual fee that some can’t afford—the film follows Tomás as, post-water-balloon, he’s sent to live with his older brother Sombra (Tenoch Huerta) and Sombra’s college roommate Santos (Leonardo Ortizgris). The boys are holed up in a flat so sparse and squalid, they have to borrow electricity from a downstairs neighbor. With classes suspended, they spend a lot of time sitting around complaining about the University’s plan to cut

Roma: This one’s nearly universally acclaimed — directed, written, produced and shot by Alfonso Cuarón. With films such as Y Tu Mamá También, Children of Men and Gravity, Cuarón has demonstrated an uncanny ability to reflect on the human condition while offering boldly entertaining cinematic experiences. Shot on 65 mm in black and white, the semi-autobiographical Roma chronicles a year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s and is Cuarón’s most personal film to date, an immersive, technically masterful, compassionate work that speaks directly to contemporary Mexican society.
The Small Glories: This folk powerhouse is Cara Luft and JD Edwards, a dynamic duo planted on the Canadian Prairies. A self-professed study in contrasts, Luft’s folky yin proves a perfect match for Edwards’ rocker yang. Thrown together purely by accident for a show at Winnipeg’s West End Cultural Centre, the Small Glories are two veteran singer-songwriters who create harmonies, authenticity, visceral live performances and equally well-matched guitar prowess.

Retrieved Text: Those familiar with the name Diego Luna will most likely associate him with his breakthrough performance as Tenoch Iturbide, in Alfonso Cuarón’s Y Tu Mamá También (2001). Having recently appeared alongside Sean Penn in Milk (2008) Luna is now plying his trade as director, with his debut feature Abel (2010) receiving critical acclaim in abundance.
Part drama, part black comedy, the film tells the bizarre story of Abel (Christopher Ruíz-Esparza) a nine-year old boy suffering from psychological problems, seemingly brought on by the abandonment of his father. These problems result in him being submitted to a psychiatric home, as he refuses to talk or communicate with anyone. However, when his mother pleads with the doctors to let her take him home, things take a dark turn upon his return.
Although Abel regains his voice and starts to communicate with his family agsin, he does so in a manner befitting the tone of his absent father; shouting and scolding his sister in an extremely aggressive manner. These events culminate in the return of Abel’s father, whose childish and reckless behaviour mimics that of his son’s recent actions.
While Abel may not quite fulfil its potential as a truly great debut, it certainly possesses enough quality and strengths to render it a thoroughly enjoyable film. The performances from the central characters are exquisite, especially that of Ruíz-Esparza as Abel. For such a young actor it is quite remarkable how he manages to preserve his childish naivety, whilst providing moments of genuine menace and threat when taking on his father’s persona. The

Shot on 65mm in black and white, the semi-autobiographical ROMA is Cuarón's most personal film to date, an immersive, technically masterful, compassionate work that, though set in the 1970s, speaks directly to contemporary Mexican society.
Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) works as a live-in maid and nanny for an upper-middle-class family in Mexico City's Roma district. When the family patriarch departs for an unusually protracted business trip, his wife Sofia (Marina de Tavira) is left at home. Inhabiting a role somewhere between family member and employee, Cleo helps Sofia and the kids through a period of difficulty, just as she is dumped by her self-absorbed boyfriend when he discovers she is pregnant.
As both women face the possibility of single motherhood, it's obvious that their disparate levels of social status will differently impact their possible futures. ROMA subtly explores these ethnic and class divisions with a potent sense of emotional intimacy and historical acuteness.
Meticulously recreating the past — including the Corpus Christi massacre of 1971 — ROMA not only recalls the personal memories of the filmmaker's youth but also the sources that have informed his uniquely spectacular brand of storytelling. Paying homage to the resilient women that helped shape the man he would become, Cuarón reminds us of

Sometimes a single movie, sometimes a recommended list to pick from. They’re going to have a somewhat static back catalog (probably the stuff Janus has distribution rights on versus the titles Criterion licenses from studios, but it’s probably technically the best stuff they have—it’s the Kurosawa, Bergman, Tati, Fellini—but also some studio licensed stuff). But you’re going to be able to tune on a particular day and get something a little different than the day before, which sounds cool. In some ways, The Criterion Channel solves my big problem with Criterion—they don’t have any great mainstream acquisitions anymore. Criterion was very responsible for Wes Anderson back in the Rushmore days. But they also don’t have interesting genre acquisitions either.
Maybe I’m just angry they bothered with a Magnificent Ambersons instead of using it to spearhead a budget line. Whatever.
I thought it might be fun to pick out highlights in the Criterion Channel program.
First week, April 8 – 13. Columbia Noir spotlight, Y tu mamá también, female Italian filmmaker spotlight (including Bicycle Thieves), David Lynch, John Woo presenting a French musical plus a John Woo, Bugsy Malone on Saturday.

Design thinking is a structured approach some designers use to generate and develop ideas, products, and innovations.
It’s most often associated with IDEO, the well-known design firm that created the first Apple mouse, and Stanford’s Institute of Design – where I expect to send me kid to-.
Its a process to guide the development of new consumer products applied often by non-designers, to business (including big companies like Apple, as well as social entrepreneurs like for example the d.light company and many others over here in Bilbao.
Design thinking is empathic and human-centered, action-driven, multi-disciplinary, collaborative, and conversational and takes physical space seriously. The stages of design thinking are laid out like this: Empathize (or observe), Define (or interpret), Ideate (or brainstorm), Prototype (or experiment), and Test (then improve).
I love the way Bruce Mau uses design thinking to help a community group in Sudbury [USA] to uncover hidden assets and reimagine itself for the 21st century. He explains the process very clearly with simple and profound examples in the video.

Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may not have any profound statements to make about the human will to survive, and its character development may be distractingly sentimental, but as a cinematic experience, it's hard to beat. In fact, it may be the most thrilling, transporting, and unbearably stressful 90 minutes in the theater you have ever experienced.
In its stunning opening 15-minute shot, we're introduced to astronauts Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), floating 600,000 feet above the Earth as they repair the Hubble Telescope. Retirement-bound veteran shuttle pilot Kowalsky regales his colleagues with tales of past exploits while scooting around on his jetpack, playing country-western tunes. Stone serves as Kowalsky's complement, the nervous rookie overseeing the telescope's data upgrade. Clumsy in her unwieldy spacesuit and struggling to hold down her last meal, she tries to tune out his incessant banter and focus on the task at hand-no easy job given the breathtaking spacescape before her.
It's a light-hearted, joyously banal sequence that establishes the workaday rapport that exists between the crew. For us, on Earth, it's a rare and spectacularly mesmerizing glimpse into the world of orbital travel. For the astronauts, it's another day at the office.
That breezy, placid mood is suddenly shattered when mission control reports the detonation of a Russian satellite half a world away. Debris, traveling at thousands of miles per hour, bears down on Hubble. From this moment on, Gravity becomes an extravagantly conceived and brutally intense disaster movie where the audience is immersed in the

The celebrity gossip site wrote that Gifford has been lobbying for the move, while Kotb is adamant about staying in New York City. Earlier, Page Six reported that Kathie Lee and Hoda's two week stint in Los Angeles was a test run for a permanent move, though "Today" denied the rumor.
Kotb had reportedly expected Gifford to drop the idea once her musical "Scandalous" opened on Broadway in November. However, the show — which focused on the life of famed evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson — closed after three weeks.
Other sources told TMZ that the tension "began when Hoda felt Kathie Lee snubbed her by not promoting her book on the air." Kotb recently released "Ten Years Later" about six people who overcame significant adversity.

Frankly, I’ve never watched the show — I’m not their target audience — but I was very much aware of it, in part, because of a different show I watched: Saturday Night Live. During her run as a cast member, Kristen Wiig regularly portrayed Gifford as wine-loving nut who was constantly sipping on her glass of white among other antics. So as a result, regardless of how accurate that impression was, wine-consumption became an indelible part of my idea of the Kathie Lee- and Hoda-hosted hour of Today show.
Fitting then that, as VinePair reports, wine consumption — and specifically, just how much of it happened — came up during Gifford’s final day. As part of a reflective quiz show she played with co-host Hoda Kotb, Gifford was asked to guess how many glasses of wine had been served during her time at Today. The choices were 2,500, 5,300, and 10,800 — and Kathie Lee immediately guessed that they’d had over 10,000. Turns out she was wrong, the actual number was 5,300. “That’s not a lot over 11 years,” Gifford stated.
To be fair, we can #TheyDidTheMath on this one, and she’s not wrong. It comes out to about 482 glasses per year, and assuming they’re talking about glasses doled out to both her and Hoda, that’s 241 glasses per person.

I have fond memories of Shaun of the Dead, because I saw the preview in 2004, along with the creators Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright. See crappy photo below as evidence. Shaun of the Dead was a zomedy (zombie/comedy), while Hot Fuzz tried to take on the cop genre.

As far as Paige Kenneally is concerned, "Grease" on stage is better than "Grease" on film, and that's saying quite a bit.
"I was a fan of the movie, but our director is interpreting the musical differently, and I think what he's doing is brilliant," said Kenneally, who was tapped by director Christopher Stefani to play Sandy in the 1972 Jim Jacobs-Warren Casey Broadway smash this month at the Schenectady Light Opera Company. "In the movie it's about Sandy and Danny, but it's actually everyone's story and I think that's pretty cool. It's a real ensemble the way we're doing it."
Whatever SLOC is doing with the show, it's hard to go wrong with "Grease." The original Broadway version with Adrienne Barbeau and Barry Bostwick was nominated for seven Tony Awards, and revivals in 1994 and 2007 were also well received. The 1978 Hollywood film with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John was also a commercial and critical success, and "Grease: Live" in January of 2016, with Julianne Hough and Aaron Tveit in the two lead roles, was also a hit.
"I've seen clips of some stage versions on Youtube, and I did see the movie and the live version they did on TV," said Kenneally, who is a junior at Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake High School.

Heat Vision reports that Elijah Wood will star in Grand Piano, a thriller from The Last Exorcism 2 writer Damien Chazelle and Spanish director Eugenio Mira (who also composed the music for Timecrimes and several other films under the name Chucky Namanera). The story follows a once-great concert pianist who suffers from stage fright and comes back to perform after a five-year hiatus. That seems daunting, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Just as the pianist sits down at his instrument to play the first bar of music, he notices a threatening note on his music sheet that informs him that he must play the best concert of his life in order to save the life of himseld and his wife. The trade describes the film as Speed at a piano. I'm not sure how they plan to keep up the suspense with Wood at a piano, but director Rodrigo Cortes pulled it off with Buried, and the filmmaker is producing the film with Adrian Guerra, a collaborator on the 2010 underground thriller.

I think this is a very successful interpretation of the book by an obviously obscured to western audiences Russian writer Leskov. Although the purists would abhor some cuts in the opera itself, I think the singing and acting convey very well the primordial desire. Katerina never regretted the killing of her husband, according to the book - she was totally consumed by her lust to Sergei. And she despised her life in her husband's family. I give this work credit for the freedom of the artistic representation - Shostakovich did not follow the book to the last letter, so the creator of this film did not do it to his complete score, too.

Part action film, part comedy, and part disaster/horror film this was a seriously fun movie. Made on what looks to be a very modest budget, it never distracts from all the fun and excitement happening on screen. While it drags a little at the end the rest of the film soars by riding on witting dialogue, great one liners, fun action sequences, and great performances.
I was really impressed with the writing of the film. This was probably it's biggest strength. As good as the writing was though it wouldn't have had the same effect without the great actors who delivered the lines.

Not too long after watching Kane, I was talking to a friend and mentioned that I’d seen it. She said she had a book on Welles, and offered to give it to me. I was thrilled. I hope I thanked her profusely. It was Joseph McBride’s critical study, simply titled Orson Welles. I took it home and started reading it immediately.

They met for lunch one day, and the next thing McBride knew he was acting in the director’s latest project, a film called The Other Side of the Wind.

Set in the 1970s, it tells of the downfall of director Jake Hannaford (John Huston), a relic from the Classic Hollywood era struggling to complete his latest project as he is eclipsed by a new generation of filmmakers.
The movie is incredibly hard to follow. Its dense plot, presented in a non-explanatory, matter-of-fact way, is shot in a snippety, mockumentary style, and edited at the speed of light. The Wind is a complicated sketch of an even more complicated world, one of which we only seem to scratch the surface. Just like Hannaford’s own unfinished movie, the complete story is left unknown.
When you finish the film, Netflix suggests you watch a documentary about Welles called They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead. If you initially passed up on it, definitely go back and watch; it’s a true telling of what was happening behind the cameras while making The Wind.
Orson Welles was a one-in-a-million genius. He ran a Broadway theatre company when he was 22 years old. At 23, he staged a radio performance based on H.G. Wells’ science fiction book, The War of the Worlds, that went down in history as the moment we realized the true power of media. And when he was 26, he wrote and directed Citizen Kane,

Oh, but what a glorious, oddly compelling mess The Other Side of the Wind is.
Within the final cut’s two hours and two minutes, you’ll see Welles lampooning Hollywood, the Swinging Sixties (which, of course, spilled over into the “Me” decade) and, most of all, an overindulgent former wunderkind filmmaker by the name of George Orson Welles.
The Other Side of the Wind’s story structure immediately brings to mind Citizen Kane, from which the hobbyist magician also borrows some camera tricks. Welles’ dizzying framing of characters in shadows and reflections harkens not only to his most acclaimed masterpiece, but also to The Stranger (and the works of filmmakers he obviously influenced, such as Steven Spielberg).
In Kane, the audience was tasked with getting inside the head of a multimillionaire media mogul. In Wind, it’s a past-his-prime director who could have just as easily been played by Welles himself, but instead we get a real-life equal, John Huston.
He’s J.J. “Jake” Hannaford, who returns to Hollywood after years in self-exile in Europe to complete work on a comeback movie that attempts to tap into the free-loving, hippie-dippy atmosphere of the day so as to interest a new generation of filmgoers and keep up with a new generation of filmmakers.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are in Los Angeles winding up their penultimate rehearsal for what Petty says will be the band's last all-out tour. And the only outsider they've allowed in is the legendary director Peter Bogdanovich and his crew, who have been recording the band's every breath for a forthcoming documentary. Each song Petty plays -- from old Fleetwood Mac covers to his new ballad "Square One" -- elicits a flurry of excitement from Bogdanovich, who instantly starts asking what song it is, comparing it to earlier rehearsals and figuring out what camera coverage he has on it.
When the rehearsal ends, Petty looks around the studio, lost and out of place, until his eyes fix on his free-spirited blond wife, Dana. She presses against him, his face fills with life, and the two merge into one self-contained suede-fringed being for the rest of the evening.

Beautifully photographed by Robert Surtees with spot-on production and costume design by Polly Platt and art direction by Walter Scott Herndon, the film-literate Bogdanovich clearly studied closely Martin Ritt’s 1963 black and white classic, Hud, which was based on a novel by Larry McMurtry who also wrote the novel on which this film was based, and who shared the screenwriting credits with Bogdanovich.
The result is a perfect match between style and substance. The Last Picture Show is less an elegy for the past than its reliquary, the present of the film's narrative being for us always the past.
We see this largely through the character of Sonny (Timothy Bottoms), in his last year of high school and a diffident young man with low expectations. He is in awe of his good-looking best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges) whose girlfriend (Cybill Shepherd) is the prettiest girl in town and the bulk of the narrative is a kind of coming-of-age story of how he loses that awe and most if not all of his illusions with it.
The film maintains a steadfastly observational approach, not attempting to attain any dramatic highs and lows in what is a really series of loosely connected vignettes in which the characters segue from one permutation to another, only forming an emotionally meaningful bond at the film's end.

Star Wars has made a habit of cartoon spin-offs...and many other cartoon series have done "re-makes" of Star Wars. Unfortunately, cartoon reboots of live action films may suffer because the audiences are completely different. Most of your live-action reboots of cartoons bank on the nostalgia factor bringing in the audience and then hitting them with action to hopefully keep them hooked (Transformers and GI Joe, for example). Live action films don't have that same built-in audience that would be interested in a cartoon remake, is my guess.

When the forces of Hollywood decided to make a live action movie of cartoon classic Scooby-Doo, there were two obvious ways to go: a childish comedy aimed at kids, or a campy homage aimed at the adults who grew up with the animated version of the crime-solving teenagers and their cowardly dog. Unfortunately, with its decidedly Sesame Street approach of teaching friendship and teamwork, the Scooby-Doo feature film leans toward the former. This is one movie that's more for the children than the entire family.

But in its defense, it's not as atrocious as it could have been--and it's nowhere near as wretched as, say, the big screen take on The Flintstones.

It all goes back to this YouTube clip from Scooby-Doo: Legend of the Phantasaur in which Shaggy single-handedly takes down an entire biker gang in a bar brawl.
This drew comparisons to Dragon Ball with commenters referencing the show's use of power levels, and a meme was born.
From there, people started using screenshots from cast interviews to describe Shaggy's power.
The memes spread across the usual avenues, many of them living on Reddit in the r/BadAssShaggy community.
A lot of them play off of anime tropes, like using a small percentage of power to achieve incredible feats.
Anyway, this eventually reached Matthew Lillard himself, who...didn't quite get it at first.

Its like when Soap Operas would come on and tell you the the role of Alan Spaulding is now being played by Christopher Bernau, seriously what is that? I want my people to be MY people, no one else.
As much as I find the new voice of Shaggy to just not fit right, the most annoying "different" voice has to be on the Nemo ride in Epcot. For those that know what I am talking about its the voice of Nemo's over protective dad Marlin.

Set in the US in 1962, the story focuses on Tony "Lip" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), an Italian Amercian whose work as a nightclub bouncer stalls when the club is closed for renovations. Out of work, he is offered a job by a record company to drive a classical musician, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), to a series of concerts in the deep south.

The series first premiered on CBS in 1969, and ran through its second season in 1970. The five friends traveled around together in their beloved van, the Mystery Machine.

Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? was the first of many series, films, and various other components which made up the long-running franchise we know today.
This series presented a different format to the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? series. While the overarching concept remained basically the same, each episode featured a different celebrity or pop culture icon who was famous at the time. Each episode, the celebrity of the week would team up with the gang and try to help them solve the mystery. However, the conceptual structure remained the same - Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby catching creepy villains in the process of attempting to solve the mystery which surrounded the culprit's motive.

In terms of my own views on the movie, the visuals were stunning in 3D (and perhaps more so in IMAX), but the big thing about the movie for me was the tension and drama. In fact, there was a portion of it where I found the emotional drama perhaps too much with the choice Cuarón made in having Sandra Bullock's character in Dr. Ryan Stone having experienced a particularly horrific moment in her past. Watching things unfold on screen as Stone in pretty much ceaseless peril and combining those with her past, it felt both that the tragic backstory might be excessive and given that backstory, logical that Stone might just say "no más" (guess I couldn't get enough of the accent in Cuarón's name) and stop trying to figure out a way to survive.

A guy who specializes in orbiting, continuous tracking shots making a movie about the continuous process of orbiting Earth? Just about everyone liked the sound of that. However, there are very real barriers to setting a movie in space, and the team had to get more than a little creative to get around them.
First, the team made up the entire movie as a “pre-visualization,” an animation meant to sit somewhere between concept art and draft cut in the production process. It allowed them to plan out precisely which effects shots would be needed, and to plan their shooting schedule accordingly. Since these pre-viz animations are timed, Cuarón effectively tied every line of dialog to a timer; George Clooney may be a big-name actor, but in Gravity he still had to hit his marks precisely, or start all over again. In this film, delivering a line even a fraction of a second off schedule could force a reshoot of a whole scene.
Of course, space is about more than just hanging from wires; the visual aesthetic of space is both difficult to capture and difficult to communicate. Movie-goers are both demanding and totally ignorant of what space really looks like. A sort of space-box was created — it was lined on the interior by 196 panels,

You would think that, given all of the recent media attention on it, Roma would be really something special. Its director, Alfonso Cuarón, has made artistic fare for the masses: Gravity, Children of Men, A Little Princess, and Harry Potter and the Prison of Azkaban.
However, in terms of action, pace, style, and plot, Roma might be the exact opposite of Harry Potter.
The movie is about a maid (Cleo, played by Yalitza Aparacio) in early 1970s Mexico City. If you want its main plot, it is that the maid gets pregnant by her boyfriend, he runs off, and then she confronts him. That takes one hour and twenty-five minutes to develop. You’ve got forty more minutes of no story development after that, although the last-third might be the best third of the movie.
So, not much plot. Absent that, is the movie thoughtful, or even philosophical? What makes Roma worth watching?
Roma was made in black-and-white, for reasons I don’t understand. Granted, the color scheme pleases me. I wish that most movies were in black-and-white, but the 99 percent of my friends who disagree with that opinion also are going to wonder why a movie made in colorful Mexico looks like Roma does.

When a head constable fails miserably in his attempt to correct the corrupt police department, he swears to prepare his son to take up the challenge. He raises his son with the sole intention of making him a police officer such that he could bring about a change in the police system and in turn, in the society. How does the son mend a corrupt police force and society? This forms the rest of the story.
To assume the audience will embrace a theme that has been milked dry, is sheer thoughtlessness of the director. And to present a cornier story is even more irresponsible and proves the lack of passion of the entire team behind this project. What begins as a cliched story gets even more boring thanks to multiple sub-plots and an unneeded love angle.
Had only the director stuck to the crux of the plot - a young man's fight to make a corrupt-free police department, I suppose the film would've left an impact. But, sadly the story deviates from its chosen path and struggles to convey what it was supposed to deliver at the first place. Moreover, no matter how cliched the story of a film could be, but if presented differently, it is sure to draw some attention.

Another amazing score by Morricone that sweeps you away at the conclusion of the film. It depicts the powerful impact a paternal influence can have and reminds us not to cut out the moments of love from our life, even though they may be painful.

That meant the third flick, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, came out during the busy summer 2004 schedule. This may have been a mistake. Prisoner certainly earned good cash, as it took in $249 million. However, it showed the second consecutive Potter decline. Stone nailed $317 million, but that dropped to $261 million for Chamber. Prisoner didn’t mark a big drop from the others, but it continues to slip, and since the flick got generally good reactions, it might have fared better with an end of the year release.
Just like the first two films, Prisoner opens between school terms with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe)at home with his unpleasant relatives. When he uses magic to make his nasty Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) inflate and fly away, a row ensues and Harry flees.

I had watched this movie in the Bangalore International Film Festival 2016. How I wished Tamil movie Jigarthanda’s second half was something like this. Anyways that is my personal views which many may differ to agree. Without getting into that argument let me talk about Very Big Shot. The movie is a gangster drug lord flick at the outset. However, there is a very sensible humor throughout the script right from the first shot. Once the gangsters figure out that film roles are spared from being screened at the airport, they decide to become a producer of a film. The movie gets very interesting from there on and it is a ride filled with loads of laughter.
The screenplay has been done very nicely to ensure there is a logical flow to the whole story. The characters have been created and established the way they fit into the situations well. There is no point it looks force fitted. Usually, comedy movies suffer from the phenomenon of force fitting humor into the script.
High Points: The scene where Ziad (eldest of the brothers) decide to make a movie to smuggle the drugs, the filmmaking scene where the Bhurka clad lady is stopped and the onlookers jump in to create a commotion without realising it is a shooting.

Movie preferences are very idiosyncratic, and rarely line up with the preferences of others or the evaluations of movie critics, new research suggests. Moreover, these preferences don’t match the demographic groups movie studios use to pitch and market movies.
“What we find enjoyable in movies is strikingly subjective—so much so that the industry’s targeting of filmgoers by broad demographic categories seems off the mark,” says Pascal Wallisch, a clinical assistant professor in New York University’s psychology department and the senior author of the study in the journal Projections.
“Critics may be adept at evaluating films, but that doesn’t mean their assessments will accurately predict how much the public will like what they see,” adds coauthor Jake Whritner, a graduate of the Cinema Studies Program at the university’s Tisch School of the Arts and currently part of the Cognitive and Data Science Lab at Rutgers University-Newark.
Over the past century, filmmakers have sought to control viewers’ attention through different editing and shooting techniques, with the assumption that the audience will respond in the same way.
However, while neural and attentional processing has been extensively examined, the level of agreement in the appraisal of movies among viewers has not been studied. Similarly, while past research has analyzed the relationship between reviews and box-office success as well as agreement among critics for films, none have explored agreement between critics and the general public.

Williams, noting that the Source Awards were already known for having a violence problems, recalled how Eminem was forced to sit in an area without his bodyguards, in a sections with other artists and fans, where he came into contact with Knight’s crew.

In his statement he said, he does not want to be a “snitch! I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,” adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed.
Sloan’s testimony was offered during a preliminary hearing today, Monday, during which a judge will determine whether there’s enough evidence for Knight to stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges.

Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. He pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years’ probation for assaulting two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992.

This is not the first time that the hip-hop mogul was linked to the murder of the legendary rapper.

According to Greg Kading, Diddy paid Crips gang member Duane Keith “Keffe D” Davis $1 million to kill both Tupac and Suge Knight. Davis then allegedly passed the task to his nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, also a Crips gang member. The documentary says that on September 7, 1996, Anderson shot Tupac while the rapper was in a car being driven by Knight.

They did not look back or fall back into the lifestyle that they lived before. So I can’t help but to wonder, how did Kevin Gates and Kodak Black fall into this trap? Why are these artists who have a hit song suddenly fall into this pit where they become a product of the judicial system? Maybe their past just comes back to haunt them?

According to Consequence of Sound, Knight’s plea came days before his trial was scheduled to begin on Monday, September 24. The former Death Row Records CEO was arrested and charged with murder in January 2015 after he was involved in a hit-and-run on the Los Angeles set of the N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton. He will get credit for the three-and-a-half years he served while awaiting the trial. In addition to the murder charge, Knight is facing a second-degree robbery charge for an incident in 2014 that involved comedian Katt Williams.

More value than victims/survivors, more value than the work of Detectives from multiple jurisdictions investigating the crimes of a unremorseful repeat felon. Knight was given multiple accomodations, multiple chances and decades of criminality. Even though Suge had a long history of violence against his community, he was always given a life boat. Why?
He must be a valued asset. He must be part of a bigger corruption. He must be an informant. Why would a repeat felon be given another break? Why would a person on his 3rd or 4th Strike be given leniency with the possibility of parole after multiple violent crimes and ongoing crimes happening still under his direction as he sits in jail?

Surprisingly enough I have far less complaints about its sequel. Yes, I know I'm a minority on this but I actually liked "The Hangover Part II" better than the first movie.
Thing most people seem to have problems with is that this movie is nothing more than a rehash of the first movie. But actually I have to really disagree on this. It's using the same concept, of waking up at a strange place, after a wild night, of which none of the main characters remember anything of. But clearly a lot had happened, since there suddenly is a monkey in the room, a finger in a ice bucket, one of the guys has a tattoo on his face, the other is suddenly bald, one of their friends has gone missing and Mr. Chow somehow ended up in the room as well. So it's using the same sort of concept and setup as the first movie but how would it had been a Hangover movie if it was using a totally different concept? And really, just because it's using the same concept that doesn't of course mean that all of the situations, funny moments and characters are all the same as well. On the contrary, "The Hangover Part II" has plenty of originality going for it and I actually think it's a better written and constructed movie than the first one.

Overall — I liked it. Bella was perfect. Edward was good but not out of this world, but how could any Edward be perfect?

I enjoyed watching and would definitely watch it again.
As I sat there watching it, I did have one thought over and over.

So, then I wondered if part of what I didn’t like with Edward was just a screenplay issue. I really don’t know enough about movie making to know if it was acting, screenplay, or directing.
My final analysis is regarding the cheese factor. There definitely was one. Not that it was unexpected. Heck, the book is written for teenage girls. The storyline is about a vampire romance. It’s going to have its cheesy elements. My problem wasn’t that kind of cheese. My problem was that there

I had liked Chetan Bhagat’s “Five Point Someone”,when I read it in Engineering Final Year, but somehow, after reading “One night at call center”, I didn’t want to read another one by this writer. I would not have had high expectations from the Bollywood adaptation of FPS, but Hirani and Aamir’s names made sure that I was eagerly waiting for this movie. So I made use of the vacation time and went for the movie right on the day of its release.
FPS: Yes, “3 idiots” is loosely based on FPS. But very, very loosely. Except for a few sequences, Hirani could have just made the movie w/o crediting Bhagat (not that I am suggesting this) and it could have gone almost unnoticed. Which one is better? FPS covers college-life in more details, but overall, 3i is much better.
Aamir’s earlier movies: A story of friends automatically brings comparisons with DCH and RDB, while attacking the education-system and parents’ attitude makes you recall TZP (in parts). But, a comparison with any of these three isn’t good for any movie. 3i doesn’t even come close.
Munnabhai series: No, the comparison is not just because of Hirani-Vidhu combo. It is the right combination of message, emotions and comedy that the movie shares with Munnabhai –I & II. But, on all three elements, I’d rate 3i lower than at least Munnabhai-I.

For the record, I found the film, while spectacular in its production values and camera work, a tad slow and slightly boring.
Likewise, the only allusion to evolution in "March of the Penguins" is a line near the beginning, intoned in the English-language version by the narrator, Morgan Freeman: "For millions of years they have made their home on the darkest, driest, windiest and coldest continent on earth. And theyve done so pretty much alone."
How in the world is that an "allusion to evolution"?
I think that is an allusion to evolution because people who disagree with evolution generally think the Earth and all life on it is 5000 or so years old.

Plot was nonsensical -- and not in a good way -- characters were dull, unlikable and inconsistent. A wasted opportunity. Hey, if you liked it, great! I'm glad you had a good time. But I'm warning people to stay away.
Still want theatre experience for this movie $6 is ok.

It’s unclear how much time has passed since the end of the first movie, but we do know that the Guardians get hired for jobs. The movie opens with them trying to protect a planet or group’s (I’m not really sure) special batteries from monsters that are trying to steal them. From there they, of course, find themselves getting into trouble and having to get themselves out of it.
I found the movie to be entertaining and I enjoyed it. It was a little less silly than the first movie which is something I missed, but the storyline was a little more involved in this one so perhaps they had less time to spend being ridiculous and had to be a little more serious. It was still funny though so it’s not like they completely cut out the humor. There were still plenty of laughs had by all – it’s just that the characters are a bit better at their jobs now so they weren’t doing as many dumb/ridiculous things.
It really does come down to preference though. I, for one, enjoyed the movie. My other friends that I went with liked the first one better. I don’t know if I can say which I liked better. I think they’re different. One of my friends

Not in the sense that every movie I’ve watched has been outstanding but rather, I’ve watched an immense amount, for someone who only watched She’s The Man in 2012 and have not seen a single Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie. Basically, I’m not a huge movie buff - I don’t rush to watch movies unless I feel like it’s necessary and I’m not fussed on whether I do get around to it or not. I guess the biggest difference this year is that the friends that I’ve been hanging out with all love watching movies, and it’s become a social thing for me. Almost like a movie club!
So without further ado let’s get into the first half of the year recap.
Most, if not all of these, are pretty mainstream movies with heaps of hype around them.
I’m going to admit it, I’ve barely seen any of the other Wolverine movies, but Logan was amazing in that I didn’t have to know much about the other two to watch this one. It was such an emotional journey, played out spectacularly by Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen. The plot was detailed enough, without dragging out moments, and I loved that it conveyed themes around equality, discrimination, love and family.

I know that if directors tried to fit every little detail, we'd wind out with 24-hour films. I also know that what we watch on screen is the director's creative vision. And, well, sometimes it doesn't jive with what I had envisioned while reading the book.
That being said, I thought this was a poor adaptation. The movie ran around two hours long. It had a fantastic cast, but the story line seemed disjointed. I think you needed the details and background information the book provides. The director/writers tried to incorporate it, but it didn't work. Also, the writing wasn't that great either.

Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were arrested shortly after the attack and charged with first degree murder following Shepard's death. Significant media coverage was given to the killing and what role Shepard's sexual orientation might have played as a motive in the commission of the crime. McKinney's defense counsel stated that he had only intended to rob Shepard, but had killed him in a rage when Shepard made a sexual advance toward him. Both McKinney and Henderson were convicted of the murder and each sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.
Shepard's murder brought national and international attention to hate crime legislation at the state and Federal levels. In October 2009, the United States Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. On October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the legislation into law.

We hear details and see home movies, videos and photo albums of the personable Shepard growing up with two supportive parents, being interested in school theater and so slight in build and manner that one of his more out-and-proud friends called him a "pocket gay." He was not an especially extroverted type, but did not seem to have an enemy in the world, at least according to this film.

In October 1998, 21-year old Matthew Shepard met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyoming.

The play is not a depiction of the deadly attack, but a more subdued and stark observation of the many different reactions that a small town has to a stunning act of violence.
True to the original production by the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project, Thomas’ production will feature eight actors — four male, four female — rotating to play 70 characters. The cast ranges from Peninsula Community Theatre veterans to York High School students Carly Murray and Ashley Zadel.
Thomas said she likes and respects that the play does not comment on the reactions to Shepard’s death as much as it observes them.

Sprouting from the crime was outrage from supporters and opposers of homosexuality alike that raised awareness regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation. The aftermath was the birth of a play. The Laramie Project illustrates Laramie’s response to Matthew Shepard’s death. The heart-wrenching story presents the views of those both for and against homosexuality. Performed by Maplewood Richmond-Heights High School, the play ignited as much controversy as when the play was first published. Proving the significance of the piece, was Westboro Baptist Church’s protest on the day of the performance, where many took a stand against the play and homosexuality. Despite the opposition, MRH High School students persevered with courage to put an end to discrimination. The show was a statement. A statement for love, and a cry for peace.
The Laramie Project has many unique components. The cast consists of a few actors who perform in many different roles. Notable was Presten Pinnell, who played four roles, but most prominently the character, Matt Galloway. Pinnell was a memorable actor because he was consistent in creating different characterizations in each role. Also masterful was Ben Speed (Jedadiah Schultz and Aaron McKinney) who was almost unrecognizable as the same person with his different characters’ vocals and mannerisms.

Matthew Shepard was a college student in Laramie Wyoming. One night at a bar, two teen-aged boys offered him a ride. Instead of taking him home, though, they tied him to a fence in a remote location, beat him, and left him there. All because he was gay. The next day a jogger found Matthew and got him to a hospital. He died later from the injuries.

The play draws from multiple interviews, transcripts, and various journal entries and news reports. October 2018 marked the 20th anniversary of his death, and director Catherine Hopkins, theatre teacher, hoped it was executed with passion and emotion.
It’s not very often that high schools see “The Laramie Project” in production because of its crude language and controversial subject. Along with a unique production comes a unique set. This year’s cast brought the audience on stage with them for an up close experience. There were risers on stage and the audience sat just feet from the actors.

Due to this pressure of trying to execute the play correctly, the cast has had to step up their game more than normal. The lead roles were only assigned to veteran actors and the less experienced members are playing the small roles.

Tarantino is currently at the beginning stages of a new project, said to be about the Manson Family murders.
One of the reasons Tarantino is considered by many one of the greatest directors of all time is his dialogue, the way he makes characters interact is so realistic and timeless. Sometimes, the characters conversations will have nothing to do with the plot, but can make the audience laugh or cry.
The most popular scene that uses this tactic is the “royale with cheese” scene in “Pulp Fiction”. In this scene, Vincent and Jules talk about what a Mcdonald’s Big Mac is called in France. This conversation has nothing to do with the theme or the plot, but makes the characters life-like.
Another reason Tarantino is so respected is because of his character development. All of the characters in his stories go through a transition throughout the film. It could be Jules, who decides he is going to abandon his life of crime in pursuit of enlightenment, or it could be Django, an ex-slave on the hunt to find his wife.

The fact is that a movie is only as good as its “below the line” crew, and all of us at Collider have long felt that they aren’t given enough credit. To try and rectify this, you can look forward to more interviews with costume designers, production designers, composers, editors, cinematographers, and other craftspeople that work to bring these stories to life.
In this spirit, I recently sat down with The Hateful Eight costume designer Courtney Hoffman. Unlike most interviews where we tend to focus on one film, I used my time with her to talk about the job as a whole, and what goes on behind the scenes. Of course we also talked about making The Hateful Eight, collaborating with Quentin Tarantino, how she got her big break, the difference between Terrence Malick and Tarantino, Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver, and more. If you’re interested in what it’s really like to be a costume designer on a big movie, you’re going to love this conversation. As usual I’ve listed what we talked about below the video.

With eight movies under his belt (Both Kill Bill films counting as one), fans are eagerly expecting and waiting for his last two films. So I though that since I have watched every Quentin movie (aside from Jackie Brown), I would list them off in how I enjoy them, from worst to best. Without further ado, here is my ranking for all of Tarantino's movies, excluding Jackie Brown.
In my honest opinion, Death Proof is Quentin's weakest film. Although it is the most experimental I have ever seen Tarantino be in any of his films, it did not help this film much. The film did have some good elements to it though. Russell's performance along with the ending were things to note. Furthermore, I enjoyed how Quentin used this film to challenge usual slasher film structures and tropes. However, the film overall felt very careless and half-assed. It felt like it was missing something that is quintessential in other Tarintino films yet I can't seem to put my finger on it. Overall, I do not recommend this film unless you are trying to have a full picture of Quentin's career so far.

Ahoy, squirts! Quint here. I've noticed a trend in modern day filmmakers that strike it big: they like to give hands up to new people. Guillermo del Toro is probably the king of this, but Peter Jackson shepherded Neill Blomkamp, Quentin Tarantino gave a hand to Eli Roth, who in turn is producing a ton of stuff for new filmmakers... It's actually a very positive side to the industry that nobody really talks too much about, but I think it boils down to these guys being confident in their work and not feeling like they have to horde every inch of success they make away from anybody else.
Everybody I mentioned is a genuine movie lover and just wants to see good movies get made. Now we can add Ben Wheatley to that list. It's not that Wheatley is so big now that he's off directing studio tentpoles, but he's found a comfortable niche making the kinds of movies he wants to make. I dig his stuff, Kill List and Sightseers in particular are standouts. Now he's producing a gothic horror film called Whitaker to be directed by weird short film director Jim Hosking.

You can see in the photo above of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate that they took care to retain the resemblance between the actresses. Robbie was trying to respect the real-life woman -- and so was QT, who (wisely) decided that aspect of Tate's physicality wasn't exactly crucial to her story.
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is set in 1969, with Margot Robbie playing the real life Valley of the Dolls actress/model who was killed by followers of Charles Manson. Sharon Tate was married to director Roman Polanski and heavily pregnant with their child at the time of her death. She was only 26. Robbie told Net-a-Porter she didn't contact Polanski about playing Tate, but since he wrote such a detailed autobiography, she didn't feel like she needed to.
The Manson murders are meant to just be a backdrop of this film, as opposed to the main focus. The two main characters are former Western TV series star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).

The film is a departure from his previous film, Inglorious Basterds, which had suspense at the heart of every beautifully drawn out scene. Instead Django Unchained focuses on quick resolutions of potentially film filling stories e.g. locating and killing a gang of train robbers: this task must take less than ten minutes of screen time. And although surely deliberate these continuous anti-climaxes prove infuriating.
Along with these anti-climaxes, Tarantino’s major focus is unrelenting action: every few minutes someone dies either by getting shot, torn apart by dogs or being blown to pieces by dynamite. With all this comes a large dose of extreme violence as we have come to expect from Tarantino.
The major saving grace is Waltz’s ex-dentist character, Dr Schultz. Shultz carries a huge personality and disregard for human life. His introductory scene carries a long and tense conversation with slave captors which mystifies them as he sits on his tooth shaped wagon. His polite, eccentric nature and odd reasoning for befriending Django creates a depth unseen elsewhere in the film. I can only hope there’s a spin-off film: Dentist-Unchained.

After developing and tweaking his latest project for almost eight years, Quentin Tarantino, a Cannes Film Festival devotee from the days of Reservoir Dogs, returned to the Croisette yesterday (Wednesday) to unveil his highly anticipated piece of Second World War hokum.
Inglourious Basterds, complete with an unusual spelling that Tarantino declined to explain, unfurls in Nazi-occupied France during Second World War and was the first title in the Cannes competition to start anything like a media stampede.
The queues starting forming at 7am for the 8.30am screening during which the reactions in the 3000-seat auditorium indicated that there was certain unadulterated glee being derived for the Dirty Dozen -style antics loosely inspired by Italian director Enzo Castellari's 1978 war film.
Tarantino, who first came to Cannes 17 years ago with his stylish, blood-spattered Reservoir Dogs, thrilled audiences in 1994 with his Palme d'Or winner Pulp Fiction, and the festival also saw the launch of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 and Death Proof.
Having served on the jury in 2004 Tarantino justifiably can claim to be a bit of an expert on the Cannes experience. “It is a bit of a colossus – like the Mount Olympus of cinema. During this time on the Riviera cinema matters and it is important, partly because all the world’s press are here. They argue and jostle and do this and that.

And Peter Weller does. His Buckaroo Banzai is as cool as an ice cold Jolt. In fact, the entire cast of the 1984 cult classic The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension — with the understandable exception of John Lithgow, who plays an alien-possessed Italian scientist — acts as if confronting an alien invasion and mastering inter-dimensional travel are just sort of what you do with your day. The aliens — the good Black Lectroids and bad Red Lectroids, both from Planet 10 — are all named John. And most of the movie takes place in New Jersey.
It is, in other words, the cinematic equivalent of a Daniel Pinkwater novel — offbeat, sharp, original. It opened in August 1984, near the end of the summer of Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. It bombed at the box office.
But it found new life on VHS, then DVD, and now you can watch it on Amazon Prime or Hulu, rent it on most online video repositories, or probably check it out from your local library. It has a devoted cult following. And it deserves it.

Fans of the movie, and even the official Buckaroo Banzai website, have come up with all sorts of explanations for the watermelon. Here's the official explanation provided by W.D. Richter, director of Buckaroo Banzai, in the official newsletter on April 1986.
Team Banzai botanical agronomists have been for years hard at work on the problem of hunger in Third World countries under constant revolutionary turmoil. A non-political, humanitarian effort, their goal has been to find ways to feed starving peoples in remote areas where traditional food delivery systems prove woefully inadequate. Often the only way to get the nourishment into the bellies of the needy is to hit and run, avoiding all petty ideological side-taking.

And the direction and approach is equally exciting: rather than annoy us with underfinanced special effects that pretend to be Lucasfilm quality, the director revels in his low budget, using conk shells as models for space ships and populating alien ship interiors with tubes, pipes, rods and duct tape.

A movie that dares call itself something both as imaginative and as cumbersome as The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is clearly bucking for some measure of cult status, and this picture managed to acquire it almost immediately after it bombed at the box office. It’s easy to see the appeal, what with its loopy characters, its loopy plot, and its loopy dialogue — it’s just a shame there’s not more lurking underneath all that surface quirk. Peter Weller stars as a physicist/neurosurgeon/rocker/celebrity who combats the insane Dr. Lizardo (John Lithgow) and aliens known as the Red Lectroids (Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya all sporting heavy makeup) with the help of his team The Hong Kong Cavaliers (Lewis Smith, Pepe Serna and Clancy Brown) as well as a Black Lectroid (Carl Lumbley). Buckaroo Banzai offers some off-kilter pleasures, but its players are maddeningly shallow: Jeff Goldblum’s entire character is defined by his cowboy hat, while Ellen Barkin is given precious little to do as a suicidal woman repeatedly rescued by Buckaroo.

They're horror-comedy - heavier on the comedy than the horror really. They're considered cult classics, and Ash, played by Bruce Campbell, is the 'hero' in all three.
*grin* I look forward to it.
in my defense, I have at least heard of the Evil Dead films. ^_^ I'm glad to hear that they're heavier on comedy; while I'm quite fine with 'dark' subject matter, and've seen/read plenty of stuff that is horrific, I'm not well versed in the commercial style of horror. the whole freddy krueger/jason/child's play thing, it just never interested me.
The original Evil Dead was almost serious. Almost.
Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is the tongue-in-cheek sort-of remake.

And that’s most likely a good thing. At least for the foreseeable future, if a filmmaker thinks they are getting away with a clever Buckaroo Banzai reference, someone will remind them, “Sorry, buddy, Spielberg already did that in Ready Player One.” There are thousands of possible examples like this.
Though, in a movie that’s not at all subtle about its references (most of them are literally announced like, “Oh, it’s Mechagodzilla!”), my personal favorite is a surprisingly subtle reference hidden in a sequence in the middle of the film that there’s better than average chance you missed.
So what Spielberg did was, much later in the movie, without bringing attention to it, he recreated the “Take On Me” video, only gender-swapped.
After, Samantha grabs Wade and runs him down twisting and turning hallways, with IOI right behind.
Then Samantha opens a small, square hole in the side of the wall and pushes Wade through. Wade thinks Samantha is also coming, but instead she turns around to face the officer.
The scene ends with Wade now on the outside of the building and Samantha being captured by IOI. But it’s kind of amazing Spielberg didn’t play the song during this sequence because so much of the rest of the movie is like that.

I always liked Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy, so I thought, in case the movie is worth nothing, I'd still get to see some friendly faces. For better or worse, I can say it was about what I expected.
I put this movie in two categories, and I think I placed it right: it's a decent comedy, with parts attempting to live up to an action movie. At its heart though it tries to be comedic and funny, so that's upon what it should be judged. Thankfully, you will get the chance to laugh out loud, but unfortunately not as much as you'd like to laugh out loud at a comedy. I won't even mention rolling on the floor.
The story isn't something really new, but it has quite a few humorous plot twists. The so-called funny character is Kelly, who really inflicts a fair amount of pain on his adversaries, but he is just such a nicely drawn, egocentric guy, that it actually works on a comedic level. It's always just about him, and him and then some more.
The actors have their charm but I won't really dwell on this as they are as high profile as it gets, Hollywood style, so you know what you get. Perhaps Wilson could have spiced up his game with a bit of the unexpected, but all in all he does what he does best.

Fairly typical lightweight Eddie Murphy fare that fails to capture the sparkle of his early work. Funny in parts, and with occasionally good action, the film makes for a reasonably entertaining diversion.
Eddie Murphy stars as professional champion boxer Kelly Robinson, a wise-cracking smart mouth with plenty of attitude. On his way to Budapest to take part in a title fight, he receives a phone call from his admirer the US President asking him to help with a top secret mission. He finds himself teamed up with Special Agent Alex Scott (Owen Wilson), a US spy whose success has been somewhat limited probably because he always gets the worst equipment while suave top spy Carlos (Gary Cole) gets all the best gadgets. Their mission in Budapest is to find a missing prototype fighter plane stolen from the US government. The Switchblade has stealth camouflage that renders it nearly invisible, even to the human eye.
No-one has any idea where the plane is hidden, but they know that it is currently in the possession of Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell), a powerful arms dealer who is planning to auction it to the highest bidder – one of whom has plans to attach a nuclear warhead to it for stealthy delivery to Washington. The auction is believed to be taking place during a fancy pre-fight party in Budapest, which Scott is able to get into only as part of Robinson’s entourage. In Hungary, Scott and Robinson also have the help of

He is better known as an actor, though, usually appearing in rather bland but commercially successful "buddy flicks" like Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights with Jackie Chan, I Spy with Eddie Murphy, and Starsky & Hutch and Zoolander with Ben Stiller.
Of the movies' Wilson brothers, Owen is "the funny one", instantly recognizable by his complicated, oft-broken nose, and Luke is "the handsome one", seen as more of a serious actor. A third brother, Andrew Wilson, is a few years older and has been in movies longer, but has rarely been cast in anything but very small roles. Owen is also the Wilson who tried to kill himself in 2007, reportedly because of a painful break-up with Kate Hudson, his You, Me and Dupree co-star.
Wilson co-starred with Ben Stiller in two comedies, the borderline brilliant Zoolander and the comparatively pedestrian Starsky & Hutch, and took smaller roles in several other Stiller flicks. Stiller also directed Heat Vision and Jack, an unsold 1999 pilot for an action-adventure-comedy series that would have starred Jack Black as a superhero and Wilson as his motorcycle.

I remember watching "Marley & Me" 10 years ago when it was released. I had a whole different perspective then than I do now. In the 10 years since I first watched this movie until now, I've graduated from college, got a real job, bought a house, had a kid, moved to a safer place, changed jobs, and we're about to have another kid. You'll notice the only thing missing from that story that's in "Marley & Me" is I don't have a dog. Nonetheless, I so resonate with how accurate of a depiction "Marley & Me" is to raising a family. It's really beautiful. I'm not a dog person (nor a cat person, to be clear) and this film proves that I'm not an animal person mostly because I can't stand the thought of losing an animal. This film puts that reality on you hard. But it's a beautiful journey of growing up together.

It just feels like everyone had fun making this movie. The dynamic between "John" and "Arnie" (played by Alan Arkin) is easily one of my favorite boss-worker relationships I've seen in a film.

However, the movie is nothing more than another vehicle for Eddie Murphy. For a supposed film for kids, the character of Murphy’s on-screen daughter takes a pretty subdued back seat.
The story follows Evan Danielson (Murphy), an investment advisor who is trying to claw his way up through the ranks of his firm. When child care scheduling conflicts arise with his ex-wife, he’s stuck with his daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). Soon, he discovers that Olivia’s imaginary friends are able to predict which investments are good and which ones are bad, which leads Evan to develop a stronger relationship with his daughter.
Golly. When the plot is distilled down in this way, it really doesn’t sound like a kids’ movie. Instead, it sounds like Evan is simply using his daughter – or rather her “imaginary friends” – to get ahead in work.

Owen Wilson is quite taken with Paris in the 1920s. He’s a writer who’s spent years grinding out scripts in Hollywood (successfully, it seems) but wishes he’d had the guts to write novels in Paris instead. He’s visiting the city with his fiancée (Rachel McAdams), who’s had enough (“If I never see another charming boulevard or bistro -) but he’s still bubbling with anecdotes of Monet and Hemingway and their fruitful time lost in their art. While he’s out chasing the ghost of Joyce down cobbled streets, the clock strikes midnight and an old Peugeot drives up, full of merry-makers. Turns out – spoiler alert – that it’s Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.
We never know whether this is magic or mental health, but he now possesses the ability to slip back to his favourite time period, 20s era Paris, and he gets invited into Gertrude Stein’s (Kathy Bates) famous salon.

The movie is jam packed with major talent: Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Jacob Latimore, Michael Pena, Naomie Harris, and Ann Dowd.
Does This Movie Have too Much Talent In It?
A few of the negative reviewers speak about their reluctance to trust the quality of a film stuffed with an endless list of high priced talent.
Sure, I get that. I can see why that thought crosses a mind. Hell, it crossed mine. But it was also what drew me into choosing the movie.
If the critics ask this nobody, I'd tell them that bad writing is made better with great acting, but good writing can be lost with bad acting.
So, this average-joe tends to look for films with acting talent first. That's not to say that movies free of big names aren't great movies, I'm just saying, the odds go the other away. With my Saturday nights, I play the odds.
Is Collateral Beauty Insensitive to Grief?

(NEW YORK) – George Lopez met his 1-year-old Chihuahua Owen when he was hosting the World Dog Awards.
But the comedian was immediately drawn to his puppy's personality.
And Owen's also an expert at giving – and getting – affection.
One of their favorite things to do together is to watch television while enjoying some dessert.
Even though Lopez hasn't traveled much with Owen yet, he is planning on taking him on his upcoming “The Comedy Getdown Tour” with Cedric the Entertainer, Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley and Charlie Murphy.
“Eddie Griffin brings his dog Peanut, and I'm supposed to bring Owen so that Peanut and Owen can hang out,” says Lopez.
One of the best parts about having a dog for Lopez is that Owen keeps him active.

Then we heard nothing else about it and it seemed like it was one of those wild ideas Hollywood kicks around for a minute and then forgets. Except, now it’s back and Eddie Murphy is involved.
The project is in development with Universal and Montecito Pictures and the big twist they’re hoping to build it on this time is that it’s not just twins, it’s triplets. If you remember the first movie had DeVito and Schwarzenegger playing long lost twin brothers conceived experimentally. But it seems there was another matched brother neither of them knew about, and it’s Eddie Murphy. That must have been one helluva womb.
It sounds like the Twins sequel, tentatively titled Triplets is still in pretty early developmental stages. THR says they don’t even have a director yet, though they’re certain it won’t be the director of the 1988 film, Ivan Reitman. He’ll only serve as a producer on the follow-up.
If this happens it’ll either be the funniest movie of 2014 and finally provide the Eddie Murphy career revitalization everyone’s been hoping for, or it’ll set a record for the most Razzies won by any one film in a single calendar year. There’s no room for middle ground here.

Anytime you throw these two guys together onscreen you’ve got the potential for comedy gold. I’d listen to them provide color commentary on a chess match for two hours. The fact is, this film is funny. Great actors can turn a run of the mill script into something entertaining. Likewise, a great script can be doomed by bad acting. You won’t be confused by which one this is, since Vaughn and Wilson carry it on their backs. Nonetheless, it’s a worthwhile watch and if the critics (present company excluded) can loosen up for a minute, they would see it’s a decent flick.
The guys are two old school salesmen out on their hides after their company closed down. If I was going to nitpick, I’d say the premise that a watch company closes it’s doors because of “technological advancements” is absurd. People still wear watches and always will. It was a sloppy albeit, minor point in the plot, but again don’t go see it if that’s something that would ruin the film for you.

Dreamgirls was a very pleasant surprise. Actually, I can’t even say that it was that much of a surprise. It was much more of a struggle to actually sit and watch it than to legitimately enjoy it.

"'The Rookie' is right up there with the best, and its achievement is all the more impressive because this Disney production, clearly conceived as family entertainment, carries a G rating, which is often a marker for blandness. Dennis Quaid stars in the real-life story of Jim Morris, a high-school coach and chemistry teacher in small-town Texas who, in his mid-30s, suddenly revives his dormant dream of pitching in the major leagues. Mr. Quaid has long been a reliably likable actor, but this time he pitches a perfect performance -- no frills, no tricks, not a single false note -- in a film that's true to its stirring subject, and to the sweetest traditions of the game... But what gives 'The Rookie' its special power and resonance is Mike Rich's fine, tactful script, which focuses on Jim and his high-school players challenging one another to succeed, and John Lee Hancock's direction, which, in its own unhurried way, has the sort of control that distinguishes elite athletes...

Alternatively if you are excited about the day to come a dream will probably - if correctly understood - link to those thoughts.

And besides giving you some good fantasies and conversation topics, dreams have another extremely important purpose: improving brain health by helping the brain consolidate memories.
To make sure you’re getting enough dream time, don’t slack off on your exercise routine. Working out for 20 to 30 minutes each day helps you grow new cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory. It also helps increase blood flow to your noggin so you can get more REM sleep. If you missed your workout, take a hot bath before bed. Sweating a little before bed is likely to give you more REM sleep that night.
Since dreams tend to leave your mind the second you put your feet on the ground, I like to keep a pen and notebook next to my bed to write down what I remember, just for fun.
Another trick I use: Every once in a while, I’ll set my alarm to wake me up five minutes earlier than usual. Since one of the greatest periods of REM sleep tends to happen close to the time you usually get up, you might catch a dream that has just ended -- and you’ll be more likely to remember it.

The unfinished video looks like raw footage of interview material for a DVD bonus, but it’s actually a very clever viral marketing video, because the third dream researcher doesn’t really exist.
Who are the Dream Researchers Interviewed by Chris Nolan?
The first dream researcher in the clip is William Domhoff, a professor of psychology at University of California Santa Cruz. The video cuts away when he identifies his title, but gives viewers enough to search for and verify his credentials. Domhoff specializes in linguistic dream content analysis.
The second featured dream researcher in the video is Jayne Gackenbach. Her lucid dream research helped define the field in the early 1980s, and she served as editor of the now-defunct journal the Lucidity Letter. Gackenbach now focuses on video game research, but has released a few studies about the topic of lucid dreaming and video game interfaces, making her a natural interviewee for Nolan. I’m excited about Jayne’s influence on this movie!

But the good part is you get to decide how you’re going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends – they’ll act like it anyway.

These feelings can arise if your boyfriend has been paying you less attention than usual. An alternative interpretation is that you're feeling vulnerable and your self-esteem is low: Perhaps you're worried that you don't measure up to his ideals or expectations. You may find that you are lacking in trust and self esteem.
Does This Mean My Boyfriend Is Cheating On Me? Probably not! You might just be worried of losing him. This is perfectly normal, and doesn't mean you're paranoid or anything. It's best not to act on dreams like this - I definitely don't think you should accuse him of cheating!
However, our minds are mysterious, and we don't always understand what we feel or think until our subconscious shows us what is going on. Maybe you do have reason to suspect that your boyfriend is really cheating on you, or is not committed to the relationship.
If you believe in dream interpretation, then you'll need to consider your feelings before looking for alternative interpretations. Your boyfriend may be distant because you are - he may be holding back because he senses you do not need him, or that you are not being as truthful about your feelings as you should be.

He won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival in 1991 for The Divine Comedy and a jury prize at Cannes in 1999 for The Letter.

It also features a glorious performance from perhaps France’s greatest living thespian, the 76-year-old Michel Piccoli – a veteran of some one hundred films since 1945. As the movie begins, Gilbert Valence (Piccoli), a highly respected theatre actor, receives the worst news imaginable: his wife, daughter and son-in-law have been killed in a car crash. Initially devastated, Gilbert gradually regains stability in his life as he increasingly devotes himself to his beloved grandson Serge. He also finds refuge in a production of Shakespeare’s The Tempest, where his commanding turn as Prospero allows him to come to terms with a deeply spiritual conception of death. After angrily refusing a terribly lucrative role in a trashy and sensationalist TV movie, Gilbert accepts an offer from an American director played by a brilliantly ridiculous John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich).

After graduating in law, he moved with his family to Rome.
After managing and editing two cultural magazines – “Primavera” and “L’Italia Orchestrale” – Podrecca founded "Teatro dei Piccoli" at the Odescalchi Palace in Rome together with Luigi Fornaciari and Giovanni Santoro. He collaborated with some of the most famous puppetry families of the time as well and with promising musicians and painters. The success of the company was so huge that they were invited to perform for the royal family only two months after the first premiere.
“Teatro dei Piccoli” was highly innovative because it mixed experimentation and tradition, so that both children and adults could enjoy it. The first international tour brought the company to South America, to countries such as Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. It would be the first of a long series of tours.

Corruption is rife. Gazi has allowed himself to lose all his bearings. On one of his sites, because of poor safety rules, a worker dies. The man’s brother wants revenge. But Gazi seems to have lost all sense of justice. In this new El Dorado, a man’s life matters less than a fistful of dollars. Blinded by his own power, Ghazi continues to scheme to increase his wealth, juggling with bags of cash, losing his soul and spending his nights with girls of easy virtue, until his path crosses that of an old friend that he knew in the resistance, Nermin. They no longer belong to the same world: she has held onto her ideals and Ghazi suddenly perceives the scale of his own decadence … but is there still time for him to turn back and recover a semblance of conscience and lucidity?

It will also be held at Beit HaTarbut in Savyon, Globus Max in Ashdod and the Einstein Auditorium in Netanya, and will run throughout the month.
The festival features nearly 20 films, which include the best of recent French cinema as well as some 20th-century gems. All of the films have Hebrew subtitles and most have English subtitles as well.
This year’s festival will feature a double bill of Jacques Demy’s 1964 classic The Umbrellas of Cherbourg – the film that made Deneuve an international star – along with one of Deneuve’s most recent films, Claire Darling, by Julie Bertuccelli (Since Otar Left, The Tree). Umbrellas is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever made, and to see it on the big screen will be an incredible treat.
It’s an unusual musical in that all the dialogue is sung, and it features a score by Michel Legrand, the great composer who recently died.
In Claire Darling, Deneuve plays a woman who is convinced that it is the last day of her life and spends the time giving away mementos, each of which evokes a memory. In addition to Deneuve, the film stars Chiara Mastroianni, Deneuve’s real-life daughter with Marcello Mastroianni, and Alice Taglioni, who plays Deneuve as a young woman.

Retrieved Text: Manoel de Oliveira is someone Luis Buñuel actively rebelled against: an aesthete. Belle Toujours, a sequel of sorts to Belle de Jour, plays out as a bad bar joke. Literally. What do you get when a man walks into a bar and deconstructs a Buñuel picture for half an hour? The answer is not a whole lot. The genius of Buñuel’s 39-year-old masterpiece—like that of David Lynch’s modern renovation, Mulholland Drive—is how the walls separating its conscious and unconscious dimensions are completely dissolved. De Oliveira strips the original film of its power by cementing its spongy mysteries with banal annotation. Michel Piccoli, one of the brightest stars in Buñuel’s complex milky way of philosophical wonders, reprises the role of Henri Husson, who spots Séverine Serizy (Bulle Ogier) at a symphony (Lynch’s Bondar might say, “Si hay banda!”), loses her in a crowd, and spends much of the film trying to catch her—perhaps to taunt her with broken glass and play with her as he once did under a table. By casting Ogier, one of the middle-class dopes from The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, in the role originated by Catherine Deneuve, and keeping her character out of Husson’s hair for so long, de Olivera rekindles a familiar Buñuelian theme: woman as obscure object of desire. But Husson, after deconstructing Belle de Jour and Buñuel’s directorial mantra for a barkeep, will eventually catch her, at which point Séverine reveals, during a suspenseful candlelit dinner, that the past is long gone and her sexuality is no longer “unbalanced.”

The phrase came to English in the early 19th century, and it has become increasingly common ever since. Today, we use it not only as a noun phrase but also as a phrasal adjective.
There is no reason to hyphenate tour de force when it’s a noun phrase (e.g., her performance was a tour de force), but hyphenating it makes sense when it’s a phrasal adjective (she gave a tour-de-force performance). But it often goes unhyphenated even as a phrasal adjective.
We tend to italicize words and phrases from other languages when they are new to English, but tour de force is no longer new, so there’s no need to italicize it in normal use. But because tour and force are English words, some publications still italicize it to avoid confusion.
In French, the plural of tour de force is tours de force. In English, both tours de force and tour de forces are used (the former about twice as often as the latter).

Apparently these hammer-wielding psychopaths came from a rival sound system which wanted to put us out of business. It was my first and hopefully my last brush with the activities of the criminal underworld.
In the past two weeks two stunning new films have been released which vividly portray the role of gangs in shaping city life. The first is Martin Scorsese's epic Gangs of New York, which tells the largely unknown story of 19th century gang warfare in Manhattan. One of the gangs, the Natives, not only profit from taxing petty thieves but also carry out violent attacks on Irish immigrants who, they fear, are going to take their jobs and already meagre homes.
In response to these attacks the Irish form their own gangs to defend themselves and in turn resort to criminal activities to fund their activities. The other film is the breathtakingly brilliant City of God. It's an exhilarating Brazilian movie which follows gang rivalry in Rio de Janeiro's poorest neighbourhoods during the 1960s and 70s.

Tomorrow we're excited to have a new poster by the great Lee Bermejo for Martin Scorsese's GANGS OF NEW YORK. Set in the Five Points district of 1863 New York, the film focuses on Irish immigrant Amsterdam Vallon as he seeks revenge against his father's killer - William Cutting, aka "Bill the Butcher." Scorsese's American epic is grandiose and full of gorgeously detailed mid-19th century production design as well as great performances, including a particularly magnetic Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill.

Check out his last five films: Hugo, Shutter Island, The Departed, The Aviator, and Gangs of New York — his genres range from gangster to biopic to mystery to horror to children. Scorsese's storytelling is simple and straightforward, a bit like Steven Spielberg, but more... grandfatherly. Like a grandfather ‘round a campfire, regaling his grandchildren with tales of his war exploits, holding them spellbound, hanging on his every word. In short, Scorsese is never boring, as all master storytellers should be.
Working at Stratford-Oakmont is never boring.
Some people seem bothered by Scorsese's apparent overuse of Leonardo Di Caprio in his films. These same people are also probably bothered by Tim Burton's overuse of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Really, it all boils down to chemistry. Also, those people know nothing.

Despite the rightly-lauded star turn by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, this film is a mesmerizing mess.

The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).

All ten films – Mean Streets (1973), Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), Raging Bull (1980), The King Of Comedy (1982), Goodfellas (1990), The Age of Innocence (1993), Casino (1995), The Aviator (2004) – will also screen at the NFSA in Canberra (July 1-23) after showing at SFF.
“Scorsese talks in a rapid-fire style as though he doesn’t have enough time to describe everything he knows", Stratton said.
SFF director Nashen Moodley said: “Essential Scorsese: Selected by David Stratton, brings to the Festival for the second year one of Australia’s great masters of film criticism to curate a selection of films by one of his favourite living directors".
The retrospective unveiling has provoked more than a few grumbles online.
The widespread availability of Scorsese's films certainly makes a retrospective of his work seem like a rather safe, and hardly necessary, bet on the part of SFF, especially when a director whose work is less easy to access might have been highlighted.

For a film that received so much critical acclaim, it seems odd it didn’t walk away with an Oscar of some sort, especially considering the strength of the acting and directing in this film. Still, ten nominations is nothing to snuff at and by the time the film hit the home video format, it gained a whole new audience of fans. Six years later the film arrives on the latest digital disc format, Blu-ray, complete with an incredible picture and audio to match.
After being incarcerated as a youth, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) was eventually released back into the world that spurred his family. Amsterdam returned to the five points where he watched his father die at the hands of Bill “The Butcher” Cutting (Daniel Dae Lewis). Despite allying himself with Cutting at first, Amsterdam eventually turns on him to exact his revenge for the murder of his father, sparking another war between the Dead Rabbits (led by Amsterdam) and The Natives (led by Cutting). The final battle between two men who were once friends culminates in a bloody finale, bolstered by the town’s revolt against President Lincoln’s draft.
While writing that summary I found it odd that I was able to condense the entire film, which runs near three hours, into a single paragraph. Then

Retrieved Text: When Martin Scorsese's filmography is explored, there are typically two efforts that define his oeuvre: 1976's "Taxi Driver" and 1980's "Raging Bull." However, during this fertile creative period there was another picture, sandwiched in-between, a 1977 feature that effectively stalled and oddly reenergized Scorsese's career. "New York, New York" isn't a forgotten or lost picture, but one that's rarely brought up when a discussion of the maestro is introduced. A shame, really. While it's flawed and fattened, it's one of Scorsese's more appealing experiments, looking to resuscitate the traditional Hollywood musical within the raw mood of the 1970s, creating an unusually frosty, but pleasingly unpredictable candy-coated psychodrama.
It's the end of WWII and saxophone player Jimmy Doyle (Robert De Niro) is looking for a good time, stepping into the path of USO singer Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli), who is skilled at refusing his advances. A frightfully determined man, Jimmy pursues Francine until he breaks her spirit, with the couple embarking on a musical career, facing bookers more interested in her voice than his jazz-influenced musicianship and red-hot temper. Struggling to make a name for himself, Jimmy's destructive ways take their toll on Francine, whose passive nature and eventual pregnancy keep her pinned down, allowing her husband further control. As the years pass, the two struggle to define their union, leaving Jimmy and Francine to wonder if they're better off apart.
It's always a treat to find a director interested in paying tribute to the seminal motion pictures of his cinematic education, with Scorsese perhaps the finest student around.

Featuring a cast that includes Robert De Niro and several future stars of 'The Sopranos,' the film hit theaters in 1990 and received rave reviews for its depiction of organized crime. Twenty-three years later, we revisit the cast of the film and see what they're up to now.
Then: Ray Liotta played Henry Hill, the main character who idolizes the New York mob and tries to rise up their ranks. Liotta turned down the part of Harvey Dent in Tim Burton's 'Batman' to make the film.
Then: Lorraine Bracco played Karen, Henry's wife, who gets herself unfortunately mixed up in his line of work.
Then: Paul Sorvino played local mob capo Paul Cicero. Sorvino almost dropped out of the film because he didn't think he was cold enough for the part.
Now: Sorvino's film credits include 'Nixon' and Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet,' and he recently appeared in the film 'Jersey Shore Shark Attack.' He received the lifetime achievement award at the Gold Coast International Film Festival. His daughter is actress Mira Sorvino.
Then: Frank Vincent wanted the role of Paul Cicero, which went to Paul Sorvino, but instead accepted the smaller part of Billy Batts, a member of the opposing Gambino crime family.

Retrieved Text: Scorsese’s long-awaited epic is ultimately disappointing – it’s messy, much too long and incredibly violent, but worth seeing for a staggering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.
Gangs of New York probably has the distinction of being the longest-awaited picture of Martin Scorsese’s career. After a reputedly torturous shoot which began in 1999, it was due to be released in December 2001, before being delayed for a year because it was thought that audiences wouldn’t stomach so much New York-based bloodshed that close to September 11th.
Unsurprisingly, this has given rise to rumours of ‘post September 11th touch-ups’. Unfortunately, the finished product hasn’t exactly been worth the wait and fails to live up to the admittedly high expectations that surrounded it.
The story is pretty basic. It begins in the Five Points district of New York in the 1840s, with an astonishing opening battle sequence in which Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) and his Dead Rabbit Gang square off against Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his Natives Gang, who distinguish themselves by wearing bizarre stovepipe hats, which are certain to cause unintentional giggles.
Anyway, Neeson gets horribly killed by Day-Lewis, which is a terrible shame because you want to know more about his character. Anyway, his son scarpers, swearing revenge, and returns 16 years later as ‘Amsterdam Vallon’ (now played by Leonardo DiCaprio).
By this time the monstrous Bill The Butcher (complete with a glass eye that he occasionally taps, menacingly, with his knife) is head of all the Five Points gangs and is busy aligning himself with corrupt politicians such as real-life

WHO'S IT FOR? Fans of Nicolas Cage might be the easiest sells for this movie, as they should be aware of the cheesy potential considering his named attached. Action movie fans should be warned this isn't The Seventh Seal with swords.
There's nothing too nightmarish about Season of the Witch (in a bad movie sense, of course).
This stance feels like a fair way to start assessing this flick for two reasons: its theatrical release was delayed for almost a year, and it stars Nicolas Cage wearing another mop on his head. Usually either of these components can lead to a Cage-master disaster. Mathematically, combining them feels like a poisonous mix. Plus, when this movie finally did come out, it was on the first of January. That nearly puts it automatically to the bottom of this year's trash barrel, with The Roommate and Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son literally pig-piling on top of it.
The movie's biggest flaw is that nothing really happens. On a very weak register, one could say that this is a journey movie, but even such events are extremely mild. It's a "journey" movie with the energy of something standing in place, doing exactly what we'd expect it to. For example, when they cross a bridge, they wear the thin rope to its final strand and ... you can guess what happens.

But it's the director of the movie, Panos Cosmatos, and coping with the passing of his parents, that led to Cage's wild role.
Few can top Nicolas Cage in the crazy department, but the actor met his match with the director Panos Cosmatos.
The filmmaker has built a fan base thanks to his beautifully demented storytelling, and that's only with one feature film under his belt.
2010's "Beyond the Black Rainbow," Cosmatos' feature debut, gave audiences a twisted and visually stunning sci-fi movie about a young woman's journey to escape a weird institute run by an even weirder doctor. The beautiful sets and costumes matched with the trippy music and cinematography to help introduce Cosmatos as a new original voice to genre filmmaking.
Eight years later, Cosmatos has finally returned with a new movie, "Mandy" (opening in theaters on Friday). And though this one continues his love of strange characters, gorgeous visuals, and thrilling soundtracks (this time using rock and roll versus the electronica sound of "Black Rainbow"), it will get a bigger profile with the casting of Cage as the star of the movie.
Here Cage plays Red Miller, a quiet man who lives in California's Shadow Mountains, where he cuts down trees with a chainsaw all day and comes home every night to Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), his true love. But when a religious cult kills Mandy, Red goes into a psychotic rage, killing everyone (human and supernatural) who was involved in her death. That includes battling bad guys with

These misconceptions include only selecting "over-the-top performances," making movie choices based on paychecks, being "obsessed with comics" and embracing excess. But the actor is also aware of how critics feel about some of his movies, namely the dismally received 2006 thriller "The Wicker Man."
"The issue with 'The Wicker Man' is there's a need by some folks in the media to think that we're not in on the joke," Cage said. "But you don't go around doing the things that character does -- in a bear suit -- and not know it's absurd. It is absurd. Now, originally I wanted to play that cop with a handlebar moustache and like a really stiff suit, and the producers wouldn't let me do it. And then you would have known how in on it we were, Neil and myself. The fact that that movie has been so lambasted means there's an inner trembling and power to that movie. It has become an electromagnetic movie! And so I love it."
Cage -- who in 2012 said he was open to the idea of a "Wicker Man" sequel -- comes off as surprisingly self-aware in his sentiments, saying he "can't get used up" because he feels restless when he isn't working.

And then they’re gone, and suddenly we’re listening to Chinese actors we don’t know talk about kings and thrones and birthrights, and we’re not sure what’s happening and we’re scared. By the time Cage shows up, holding a bloodied sword, glowering at the camera from beneath a mat of dark, tangled hair, and speaking in an accent of vague origin, the movie establishes itself as one of the odder upcoming films no one’s heard of.
Outcast is an international co-production between China, Canada, and France, financed in large part by an organization called the Yunnan Group. Directed by longtime stunt coordinator, first-time director Nick Powell, Outcast may provide an actor like Cage an opportunity to export his particular brand of crazy to nations where it hasn’t yet grown thin.

Cage will instead do a 3D action for Nu Image/Millenium Films and a thriller for Maguire Entertainment and Endgame. Both films are centered around a theme of revenge. Neither of the two films announced however would have interfered with "The Green Hornet" shooting schedule, leaving Cage's reasons for not joining the film purely based on money.
The 3D action set up at Nu Image/Millenium Films titled "Drive Angry" follows Cage as he carries out a vendetta on the people who killed his daughter and have kidnapped her baby. THR reports that the studio has hired My Bloody Valentine 3D director Patrick Lussier to helm the 3D action revenge.

Bay didn't spend enough time on the development of Harris' character or his predicament which lead to the outcome of the story.
As a person who loves alot of styles of movies I rarely here this mentioned by fans of the action genre, yet it is one of my favorites. Sean Connery plays his role very well, as does Nic Cage, but it is really Ed Harris who steals the show as the leader of the psycho renegade soldiers. I would recommmend this to any fan of the genre. Don't get the crappy cheap version. It is worth springing for this definative Criterion Collection version.

But, that doesn’t last for long as the drug takes hold. It’s here that Nicolas Cage says Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th came into play, which he attributes to director Panos Cosmato. Cage had this to say about the drug’s effects on his Red Miller character and where the Voorhees influence helped.
It appears that the supernatural drug in Mandy that Red Miller takes unlocks something within him that allows him to become a stalking silent murderer, much like Jason Voorhees, except for the choice of victims. Jason normally prefers teenagers, while Miller is out hunting for a religious sect and drug-fueled bikers with an axe, along with other weapons. Nicolas Cage is no stranger to going over-the-top for a role, but in Mandy, he’s absolutely unhinged.
To make matters even more interesting, Nicolas Cage was recovering from a broken ankle when production on Mandy started. The actor says that he didn’t want to lose the part, so he dove head first into the project, which he claims was a form of rehabilitation for his ankle.

Julian Assange's Wikileaks on Thursday published thousands of files stemming from the Sony Pictures hack. In all, the group released more than 30,000 documents by way of a searchable database titled "The Sony Archives." Some of these files, mainly emails sent between staffers including former Sony Pictures executive Amy Pascal, even have ties to video games--specifically the Uncharted movie.

Regarding the release of the documents--which were originally exposed last year reportedly by North Korean hackers--Assange said in a statement: "It is newsworthy and at the center of a geo-political conflict. It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there."
But Sony Pictures isn't thrilled. In a statement to The Los Angeles Times, a representative for the film company said it was unfortunate that Wikileaks decided to release the documents today.

But Ursula technically existed before Phoebe did — Kudrow played Ursula, an absent-minded waitress on the sitcom “Mad About You,” before booking “Friends,” according to Comedy Central.
For a time, Kudrow appeared on both “Mad About You” and “Friends,” which ran back-to-back on NBC. Reportedly, NBC decided to bring Ursula into the “Friends” universe and make her Phoebe’s twin in order to make Kudrow’s presence on both shows a bit less confusing.

Retrieved Text: After the original The Evil Dead (1981), there was Evil Dead II (1987), then Army of Darkness (1992), and the TV series Ash vs. Evil Dead, which premiered in 2015, a full 23 years after the last installment of the franchise. Over the course of three movies and two (soon to be three) seasons, The Evil Dead has gone from horror to a parody of the genre, and the direction the show has taken suggests that it's about to come back full circle. It's a singular kind of growth, and also speaks to something deeper underneath all that blood and gore.
The first movie, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell as Ash, followed five friends as they fell prey to demons in a cabin in the woods, and it's still one of the most iconic horror films ever made. (It famously counted Stephen King as an advocate.) That's why it's all the more impressive that Evil Dead II outstrips the original in reputation—especially as it essentially presented an alternate version of the events of the first film, but with the insanity dialed up to 11.
As a parody sequel, it also established the tone for the franchise as a whole despite its origins—blood 'n' guts 'n' jokes—and gave birth to the most well-known image of its hero. It's Evil Dead II that sees Ash locked in combat with his own hand after it's possessed by a demon, eventually chopping it off and replacing it with a chainsaw. Army of Darkness took the madness one step further,

At a casual slumber party, two teenage girls discuss a cursed VHS tape that, once watched, will kill its viewer in a week’s time. The scene starts playful, but once the reality of the tape’s existence is accepted the tone turns sinister. In the dead silence of their now-terrified mood, a landline phone rings loudly in an abrupt, bloodless scare. It’s difficult to see now in the 2010s exactly how monumental of a shift Ringu was on the horror landscape. Along with the found footage-pioneering The Blair Witch Project, Ringu helped usher in a new era of horror that shifted away from the previous decades of stale slasher rehashes & sequels towards a then-fresh aesthetic built on atmosphere & folklore instead of a mad, masked killer. Ringu’s success (and the success of its Gore Verbinski-directed American remake, The Ring) is often credited for sparking the “J-horror” wave of the early 2000s, but I don’t think it gets enough credit for inspiring a wave of technophobic horror works that adapted the concerns of earlier films like Videodrome to the culture of the digital age.

Evil Dead is one of those off beat horror flicks that polarizes a lot of viewers. While many people point to the superior and infinitely more memorable Evil Dead II, there's no denying the ambition and fun of the highly successful indie original. What many forget is that the original movie was a more serious take on the horror genre versus the "horror comedy" the series evolved into. There is a lot of argument whether this film is a remake or sequel and from the looks of the new trailer, I would classify it as a sequel/tribute. Many iconic scenes have been redone but this is a new cast of characters simply in the same cabin from the original film so don't fear someone trying to replace Bruce Campbell as the lovable Ash. As a matter of fact, both Bruce Campbell and series creator Sam Raimi are producing the new film with the former even scheduled to appear in a cameo. One of the more exciting revelations is that the film is supposed to be done with practical effects which based on the trailer, look pretty damn sweet. Enjoy!

I hadn't seen it before tonight and I expected something akin to the first movie with better effects. Speaking of effects, while you can clearly see there is a bigger budget with this movie, I felt the effects were needless and in places ridiculous. Looks like Buffy looked here for some of its ideas. All the charm of Evil Dead seems lost in the attempt to bring this one up to date for the time. Ironically it manages to date this movie even more than the first Evil Dead installment.
We have the same premise, albeit without the group of teenagers this time round. A recorded message, which was meant as a warning is played, which contains passages from the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead). This unleashes a demon which sets to possessing various people and inanimate objects throughout the course of the movie.

It's an answer a long time coming too, as Ash (Bruce Campbell) has experienced quite the character evolution over the course of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead franchise. In the original 1981 film, Ash almost served as the male equivalent to the slasher genre's "final girl" character type, showing little aptitude for heroism at first and basically learning how to survive as events progressed.
By 1987's Evil Dead II though, not only had the series taken a hard left turn from straight horror into horror/comedy, Ash had also gotten a huge upgrade in badass Deadite fighting skills and a talent for dropping clever one-liners before dispatching the enemy. After traveling far back in time for Army of Darkness, Ash had leveled up to mythological hero, saving medieval England from a Deadite plague. Sure, it was a plague he accidentally caused, but words can sometimes be hard to remember, okay?
The how and why behind Ash getting drafted into the battle against possibly world-ending evil has never really been explored in the Evil Dead franchise before, and it'll be interesting to see how the AVED team handles the question.

But this makes him no less significant nor important than his peers, in fact, perhaps quite the opposite.
Like many of his fellow Masters of Horror, Sam Raimi began making short films from a very early age with his father's 8mm camera. To those who know his work it is perhaps not surprising to learn that his first early efforts were not horror-themed, but more in line with something you might expect from The Three Stooges. This slapstick style of physical comedy is something that would make its way into almost all of Raimi's movies in some shape or form. But, before we get into that, we must talk about that little movie he made at the tender age of just nineteen called Evil Dead (1981).
With his childhood friends (including longtime collaborator Bruce Campbell of course) Raimi set out to make his first feature-length movie. Starting with a short horror film as a means to secure funding, Raimi and co. started putting together one of the horror genre's most loved films. Initially met with a less-than-enthusiastic response on his home turf, Raimi took the film to Europe where it received a much warmer reception.

Here is a trailer for Mira Nair's new film The Reluctant Fundamentalist, about a young Pakistani man who moves to the United States to seek his fortune and falls in love with the country (and, it would seem, Kate Hudson), but then is disillusioned by his treatment in the aftermath of September 11th. It looks like a movie that's trying to be timely but kind of isn't timely somehow?

Mira Nair's The Namesake, a heartbreaking, funny and universal story of a Bengali family's life in the US, will kick-start the sixth annual Indo-American Arts Council (IAAC) Film Festival starting on November 1 in New York.
Nair's film is a screen adaptation of Pulitzer prize-winning writer Jhumpa Lahiri's book of the same name. The film, encompassing the tale of millions of people who left one home for another, is spread over 30 years and stars Kal Penn, Tabu, Irrfan Khan, Jacinda Barrett and Zuleikha Robinson in key roles.
"This film is a piece of my heart - a seesaw of two great cities of the world - New York and Kolkata," says Nair.
Both the director and the author are expected to attend the gala event along with some cast of the film. It will be followed by the theatrical release by Fox Searchlight Pictures on November 3.
"Fox Searchlight couldn't be more proud to be releasing Mira's beautiful film about the universal themes of love and loss within a family. We are all in love with this movie," said Nancy Utley, chief operating officer, Fox Searchlight Pictures.
Last year, Canada-based Indian director Deepa Mehta's controversial Water, about the plight of widows in India in the early 90s, was the opening film at the festival.

WHO'S IT FOR? Fans of Persepolis may see something worthwhile in this film. For fans of understated character studies The Neighbor will definitely delight in Shirkhan's storytelling.
The Neighbor is a difficult film to describe for so many reasons. First and foremost is that it's unlike most cinematic efforts. There's no clear beginning, middle, and end, much like most people's lives. certainly there's a beginning (birth) and an end (death), but all of that gray that happens in between the two, that's what The Neighbor is all about. At times its pacing may seem glacial, but Shirkhan's directorial debut is a noble and sincere effort. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of it is the beauty in the ordinary. Each scene feels self contained, each action has an indescribable fluidity to it, and only when pieced together do they create something elaborately beautiful about the underwhelming trials and tribulations of day to day life. Even the simple act of a mother pouring hot water over noodles for her daughter, which may sound so unnecessary or trivial, is given such weight through Shirkhan's depiction. Shirkhan's personal background as an immigrant seeps into every frame, creating a personal and deeply felt story of the lives of these two women. It is through her own experiences that she

We simply cannot accept the idea that a story can be told convincingly and with sufficient entertainment is less than that. And most stories, we tell, hardly have enough meat in it to keep a discerning audience riveted for nearly 180 minutes. Movie makers may argue: we cater to the masses, and not to the high-nosed, Hollywood soaked literate gentry who walk into cinema halls only to critique and compare. That may be true; I am not questioning that. But the point is, evolution and appreciation of an art form is a bilateral responsibility. Unless the artist is bold and talented enough to change tastes and attitudes, their audience wouldn't have an opportunity to adapt and appreciate. Its a osmotic relationship. Every major change in trends - whether it be in music, painting, dance of movies demands a risk, and onus unequivocally lies on the artists to take that risk.

It was the nightmare before Christmas, really. During the seasonal party time it emerged that the Irish Film Board had come within a hair's breadth of abolition in a pre-budget row between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts. According to the Arts Department the proposal that the Film Board be scrapped was "reversed following discussion between the Minister for Arts and the Minister for Finance."
So, the Film Board was saved, but at the cost of an aggregate cut in its budget of 12.5%. The Minister for Finance's budget also shortened the life expectancy of several tax incentives, including the Section 481 incentive for film, which are now to end on December 31 2004. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, there are discussions underway about a tightening by the Arts Department of both the qualifying and reporting criteria for Section 481.
Asked if he concurred with the Minister for Finance's view that "there is no justification" to continue the Section 481 incentive beyond 2004 the Minister for Arts, John O'Donoghue replied, "The decision to curtail Section 481 relief was taken by the Government in the light of current budgetary circumstances.

Mira Grosin, Liv Lemoyne and Mira Barkhammar in WE ARE THE BEST!
Somewhere in liberal-minded but boring Sweden, two teenage girls begin a rebellion. If the premise of Lukas Moodysson's We Are the Best! sounds familiar, that's because it's roughly identical to that of the writer-director's charming 1998 debut, Show Me Love.
As well as being something of a retread, We Are the Best! is a thematic retreat from its predecessor, Mammoth, a well-meaning if contrived globalization parable. Artistically, however, the new film is a rebirth. Lightly plotted but abundantly felt, it embodies the youthful high spirits of its protagonists.
Stockholm 7th-graders and natural born dissidents, boyish Bobo (Mira Barkhammar) and Mohawk-haired Klara (Mira Grosin) are drawn to punk rock — even though Klara's older brother insists the movement is dead. (It's 1982, and he now listens to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen.) The girls decide to start a band on a whim, simply to aggravate the patronizing older boys whose heavy-metal group monopolizes the rehearsal room at the local youth center.

Living in the suspicious, terrorism-altered Western world, he is often singled out by authorities simply because he looks like a Muslim. He falls in love with Erica (Kate Hudson) but ultimately finds himself embroiled in a conflict between his American Dream, a hostage crisis in Pakistan, and the enduring call of his family's homeland. He tries to tell his complicated story to columnist Bobby Lincoln (Liev Schreiber), but perceptions and mistrust overwhelm them both.
William Wheeler has forged a richly complex, achingly satisfying screenplay from Mohsin Hamid's hugely popular, Booker Prize shortlisted novel and Mira Nair has turned it into a significant and powerful film with something to say. Much to say, in fact. Human nature is under the writer's microscope in a tense story of contemporary socio political relevance. Fundamentalism, whether of the capitalist or religious kind, are explored and presented as evil twins whose destructive consequences are inevitable.
Riz Ahmed is superb as Changez (pronounced with a hard g), creating a multi dimensional character as he struggles with the demands of his torn world. Kate Hudson is solid as the brunette who falls in love with him, and her guilt ridden reluctance (related to her previous lover) is in subtle confluence with Changez's political reluctance.
Kiefer Sutherland is steely and mesmerising as Jim Scott, the corporate killer, and Liev Schreiber is terrific as Bobby Lincoln, a columnist

This chess rule implies that even a small person, making steady and right moves, can rise to the top.
That’s what exactly happens to an unknown, neglected ten-year old slum girl, Phiona (Madina Nalwanga). Her world changes one day when she meets Robert Katende (David Oyelowo) at a social welfare project.
Watching this movie was like walking through the slums of Mathare Valley or Kibera in Nairobi although the movie is about Katwe, a slum on the outskirts of Kampala.
With deft coaching and constant encouragement from Katende, Phiona rises to play in international tournaments to become a Woman Candidate Master after her winning performances at the World Chess Olympiads.
A key role is played by the Kenyan Hollywood star, Lupita Nyong’o, as the mother of Phiona who struggles against extreme poverty to keep the family together.

The story practically begins when Oscar (Will Smith), a working-class fish with fame and fortune on the brain, owes his boss, Sykes, big time. Deep in debt, Oscar is taken out to pasture by Sykes’ Jamaican jellyfish goons (hilarious guys!). Enter Lenny, a vegan shark out on a mission to be toughened up by his brother Frankie on behalf of his shark mob boss dad, Don Lino (Robert De Niro). One thing lead to another, and suddenly it appears as if Oscar has slain Frankie. Consequently, all of this brings Oscar the fame and fortune he desires, but at the cost of his friendship with Angie (Renee Zellweger), a fish who wants to be more than just friends. Complicating matters, Lenny comes looking for a place to hide from his father, and Oscar is compelled to help to keep his secret safe.

For one thing, The Foreigner is much more of a political thriller than a ‘chop-socky’ flick. It concerns a man (Chan) whose daughter is murdered in an attack on a London business by an IRA splinter-group. As is usually the case with these things in fiction, the father is a former special forces operator, who uses his skills to track down the killers. But Chan is just one individual whom the killers have antagonised. There is also a Northern Irish politician (Pierce Brosnan), a former member of the IRA himself, now trying to keep his land steering toward peace; the head of anti-terrorist activities at Scotland Yard (Ray Fearon), and a British cabinet minister (Lia Williams), wanting to nip this renewed bombing activity in the bud. The story is complicated, with double- and triple-crosses, tentative alliances and ultimata coming and going.

The Dark Tower is still an adaptation of a very popular Stephen King novel. And Dunkirk is now in its third weekend. So, the odds remain in Dark Tower’s favor that it will manage to win the weekend. I’ve seen projections anywhere from 17-23M for this film, which is a pretty decent range for an August title. Most of Stephen King’s books are horrors, and this is more of a sci-fi/western, so it’s hard to compare it directly to anything. The film lacks proven starpower with Idris Elba, but does have Matthew McConaughey.
In Kidnap, Halle Berry hopes her long gestating film can snag some views. They’ve tried to release this film before. It used to be with Relativity, before they went belly up. Now, we’re getting Kidnap, which could do OK. Also, Detroit, which really lacks stars, but has a ton of recognizable faces, from John Boyega to Anthony Mackie. Word of mouth might be generated

Karla Dyson (Halle Berry) is a single mom with a seven-year-old son and a job as a waitress in a diner. One day she takes him to an amusement park and walks a few feet away from him to take a phone call. (Really? Who wrote a script that shows a mom turning her back on her child in public?) She turns around just in time to see a couple – Frankie (Sage Correa) and Margo (Chris McGinn) – putting her son in the back of a blue Mustang GT and driving away. Karla jumps in her minivan and spends the rest of the film chasing them. (I’m still laughing about a minivan out running a Mustang.) Fortunately, the film doesn’t last too long because the end really turns silly. I’m still trying to figure out where the police were hiding while the two vehicles are racing through the streets at 100 miles an hour. (I’m pretty confident that I would be safe in this movie as a blind guy driving a car.) Halle Berry’s performance keeps this film from bombing and the story is just barely able to keep the audience emotionally invested. Unfortunately, it never hits its stride because of the ridiculous script, huge plot holes, and it’s just plain unrealistic.

Which isn’t to say I particularly liked it. I found it decent at best and strangely distant for a film that relies so much on heavy emotion. And I think a lot of that is because almost all of the characters felt wrong.
The film follows Halle Berry’s Audrey, a widow after her husband is murdered, and her two children. It turns out that Brian, the dead husband played in flashbacks by David Duchovny, was pretty much a saint that everybody loved. His childhood friend is Jerry, a down-on-his-luck drug addict played by Benicio Del Toro. Brian has always supported Jerry despite Audrey’s wishes. After Brian’s death she decides to take Jerry in, I guess as sort of a nod to her husband’s kindness.
The film’s director is the Dane Susanne Bier, whose 2006 “After the Wedding” scored a Foreign Language Oscar nod. The earlier film had a more compelling human drama, but its characters suffered in the same way in that they acted really oddly. Again, not necessarily unnaturally but more in that it’s surprising that in neither film no one takes a moment to say, “Wait, this whole thing is pretty creepy.” She also has this weird technique of zooming way in on an actor’s eyes, which I found distracting.

Pierce Brosnan's second stab at Bond is certainly a lot more action intensive than his debut. This was probably a result of the script malfunctions that the film suffered from. The original plot of the film was based in Hong Kong and featured the theft of gold bullion. After a draft by writer Donald Westlake, a script by Daniel Petrie was chosen. But then unhappy at the way some scenes were going, Eon brought screenwriter Bruce Fierstein onto the set to do rewrites as they were filming, much to the annoyance of Jonathan Pryce especially who saw his role completely changed from the one he had signed on to play. I recall at the time of the film's imminent release reading an article about the troubled production with Brosnan lamenting that an earlier "S**t" script cost them having Anthony Hopkins as Carver. The end result is that Tomorrow Never Dies is a game of two halves. The first hour is brash and entertaining with some stylish and inventive Bondian moments whereas the second half of the film is less inspired with a surfeit of increasingly repetitive action to plug the gaps in the story.
The PTS of the film is good fun as usual.

Or, to speak more precisely, no movie except The Royal Tenenbaums gave me the impression of wholeness, by which I mean the pleasure that arises when the mind can play back and forth through a picture, discovering how the details enrich one another.
No doubt I value this pleasure so much because I’ve been trained, as a critic, to look for it. Surrealists, post-structuralists and the average moviegoer do not. Even so, I believe that when artists aspire to wholeness, they put into their work a kind of sustained intelligence that we might call integrity, care or love. When I claim that this quality is missing from most movies nowadays, I of course say almost nothing. Maybe a slightly higher percentage of today’s films are hash, compared to the run of productions in the 1930s; but that’s for the cliometricians to decide. The critic’s challenge is to find some response to the present year-end Oscar contenders, when there’s no object of criticism among them.
Should I solve the problem by jumping outside the film world? Then, from a safe distance, I could belabor the politics of Black Hawk Down for being simple-minded, and the politics of Iris for being absent. Many useful comments could be made on these subjects.

In fact, HB shattered the image of UA for me, I asserted.

During her Vh1 Behind the Music special in October 2012, Braxton opened up about her failed marriage. "I had to figure out a plan for my life that had nothing to do with him," she explained. "I was angry with everybody. I couldn&apos;t believe this was happening to me. I felt that I was a person dealing with a lot of struggles and here comes another one."

I even tried to film some of it but the footage was nearly all unusable. So, the script sat in a folder in my desk for years until I happened to bring it along with several other scripts and half finished ideas to a local gathering of actors and writers.
I had been hoping to polish up a script I had that was essentially a serious look at a troubled man in a mental institution.

Retrieved Text: Tom Hanks is an American actor, film director and producer. He is possibly best known for his performances in Forrest Gump and Philadelphia.
Childhood: Tom Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Amos Mefford Hanks and Janet Marylyn Frager. His parents divorced in 1960. Tom, along with his sister Sandra and brother Larry, stayed with their father. His younger brother Jim stayed with Janet.
Hanks attended Skyline High School in Oakland California, and was involved in a number of school plays, including South Pacific. He later studied theatre at Chabot College, followed by California State University, in Sacramento.
His career as an actor was founded in an internship that he earned at the Great Lakes Theatre Festival in Cleveland. His three years working at the festival covered all aspects of theatre work and earned him the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his role as Proteus in The Two Gentlemen of Verona.
Film Career: Hanks' acting career took a while to get off the ground. Films such as Nothing In Common failed to grasp the public's consciousness. It wasn't until he landed a lead role in Big, in 1988 that Hanks became established as a Hollywood star.
His next major project was Turner and Hooch. The film was both a financial and critical success. However, Hanks failed to capitalise on this success and his next few movies, such as The 'Burbs and Joe Versus the Volcano proved to be a disappointment for the actor.
Luckily for Hanks, he managed to regain his popularity with the release of A League of

Pumpkins, in an orange and black suit and bride of Frankenstein hair, gleefully responds to Bennett's question "Who ARE you?" with "I'm David Pumpkins!" ("And the skeletons are?..." "PART OF IT!")

Every time I saw it mentioned, I figured it had to be a joke: Conceived of by a trio called the Wonderment Consortium, the campaign promises that with $10,000, they will make a nine-foot tall Tom Hanks paper-mache statue of Hanks circa Castaway.
With each additional $10,000, they will make other Tom Hanks’ effigies —including Forrest Gump and the inspiring hero of “You’ve Got Mail.” It’s amusing, a great candidate for virality, but no one really thinks making these not-at-all lifelike pieces to be placed outside Oakland public schools will really, as promised in the campaign explanation, “make Oakland students the best they can be”?

On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. Five years, four months and twenty-nine days later, on April 14, 1965, Richard Eugene Hickock, aged thirty-three, and Perry Edward Smith, aged thirty-six, were hanged from the crime on a gallows in a warehouse in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansa.In Cold Blood is the story of the lives and deaths of these six people.

Based on the true story of the publication of the Pentagon Papers by the Washington Post, the film contains obvious commentaries about corruption and obfuscation of facts within the government.
It is considered unlikely that the Trump administration would even consider screening the film to begin with, considering the passive-aggressive stance towards news media portrayals of the government.

In recent times, he has been likened to a latter-day James Stewart and is currently gracing cinema screens the world over in his fourth film collaboration with Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies. Let’s take a moment to reflect on Mr Hanks’ career to date.
Part of the appeal of Tom Hanks as an actor is his ability to portray ordinary people, a quality which came to the world’s attention in Big (1988). In a role which earned him his first Oscar nomination, Hanks portrayed a 12-year-old boy who makes a wish and wakes up the following day as a 30-year-old man. The early 1990s saw Hanks move into more serious dramatic roles.

The producers of Cloud Atlas, the film adaptation of the 2004 Booker Prize-nominated novel thought they were reassuring the author when they told him that they would stick faithfully to the style and structure of his book. But the idea filled him with horror, he said at the Hay Festival Segovia this weekend.
“Films fail if they stick to the spirit of the book,” he said, adding that he had turned down Warner Brothers’ offer to transform the novel into screenplay because writing a film is “a different art entirely”.
The author also admitted that successfully transforming Cloud Atlas into a film would be no mean task. The novel is a complex web of six stories, which are linked together thematically, but spans centuries in time. It begins with the story of a man on a voyage across the Pacific in the late 19th century, and ends in the dystopian future, imagining a day when the English language has become so reduced that people barely use vowels.
Hanks and Grant, united on screen for the first time, will lead an impressive cast list including Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess and Halle Berry. Earlier this month Berry was spotted in Glasgow - filming the scenes set in San Francisco.

Retrieved Text: The Skinny: An engaging, bittersweet comedy from acclaimed director Zhang Yimou that ranks right up there with some of his best work. Equal parts humorous and heartfelt, this quirky little film depicts the complex relationship between an aging bachelor and his girlfriend's blind stepdaughter, centering on the duo's mutual search for some semblance of happiness in the most trying of circumstances. As per usual, Zhang even sneaks in some veiled political commentary to go along with the straightforward narrative.
At first glance, Happy Times might be considered an odd title considering the clearly unhappy circumstances of the film's major characters. For example, the protagonist, Zhao (Zhao Benshan), is an out-of-work, fifty year-old bachelor on the prowl, looking for love, but as the country song goes, "in all the wrong places." His last eighteen relationships haven't worked out so well, but upon meeting a portly divorcee, Zhao begins to think his luck has finally changed. For reasons not entirely explained, our hero feels it necessary to mislead the woman into believing he is a wealthy manager of a hotel. And since Zhao isn't just poor, but an admitted cheapskate, the prospect of keeping up this ruse seems daunting from the very start.
With the help of his old student Fu (Li Zuejian), Zhao makes over an abandoned bus, turning it into "The Happy Times Hotel," a secluded retreat for lovers seeking privacy in the bus's more natural surroundings. Unfortunately, Zhao's conservatism spoils what looks to be a surefire moneymaking proposition when he adamantly refuses to allow paying customers to

This is a film in three parts set in 1999, 2014 and 2025 respectively and one of its oddities lies in the fact that the title only comes up at the end of the first part which is far too long to be considered a natural preface. Equally unexpected is the fact that the final segment is set in the future even though there is no sci-fi element of any kind to explain that choice.
If such details suggest that Mountains May Depart is a strange film, they do not mislead. Written and directed by the noted Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke, this is a work that suffers from weaknesses in its construction. The three sections are too closely linked to be regarded as distinct tales but lack the smooth flow of a single narrative spread over time. The opening segment involves us in romantic rivalry as the well-off Zhang (Zhang Yi) and the coal miner Liangzi (Liang Jingdong) compete for the affections of Tao (Zhao Tao). Despite including a few stylised semi-abstract images that will appear throughout without explanation, this section is well acted and consequently it draws us in from the start.

Bullying is a social problem found a lot in Korean works. It is a dire topic in society in general, but especially in countries where pressure for progress and excellence over peers is high. Despite the potential to explore it, "Days of Wrath" is more of a suspense-fueled revenge story than a work about bullying.
Joon-seok (Joo Sang-wook) lives with the trauma of being a victim of bullying in school. Now, 15 years later, he meets his bully Chang-sik (Yang Dong-geun) again. Joon-seok hopes to be recognized and have his pain acknowledged, but is instead met with contempt and neglect by Chang-sik, who does not even remember him at first. This escalates badly, until Joon-seok decides to stalk Chang-sik and pay him back for his pain.
Plenty of works about bullying focus on the victim and their pain. The film does that to a degree, but it also shines light on the other end of this abuse, the abuser. Despite Chang-sik being a rich, powerful man and therefore less representative of typical bullies, his deep insecurities, abusive nature and self-destructive complexes are used by the story well. By showing his pathetic nature, the writing adds another layer into the victim's struggles as well as reasons for going deeper into his revenge.
The film is appropriately dark in tone and the suspense of it is solid. Joo Sang-wook and Yang Dong-geun also do well with what is given and Joon-seok is an interesting character. His moral choices and how far he is willing to go

In several similar lawsuits filed by actors, their rights to portraits were violated by the unauthorized use of their stills.

Retrieved Text: Chloe Zhao’s “The Rider” is a film deserving of at least two viewings. I first saw “The Rider” back in September at the Telluride Film Festival and was immediately struck by the clarity with which Zhao directed her film. While “The Rider” is a story about cowboys and deals with themes of masculinity and violence, Zhao’s film explores the fraught relationship between one’s identity and one’s community. Based on star Brady Jandreau’s true story, “The Rider” follows the life of a Lakota cowboy and his family. He suffers a severe head injury in a rodeo accident and is forced to face life without the rodeo — life without the thing he loved most and felt born to do. The rawness of Brady’s story and the uncomfortableness of some of Zhao’s scenes makes “The Rider” simultaneously captivating and discomforting.
“The Rider” is not a film to watch casually. In the opening sequence, we watch as Brady digs staples out of his shaved head. Every person in the audience squirmed and gasped, the tension of the quiet moment on screen made audible in the reactions of its viewers. Zhao gives us no choice but to pay attention, to confront the parts of life that are hard to look at. The first time you watch the film you are forced to confront tough truths.
By fictionalizing a true story and casting non-actors to play the characters, Zhao pioneers the ways in which truth can be captured and conveyed on screen. Zhao’s choice to have real people play fictionalized versions of themselves

Anticipation over director Wong Kar Wai (王家衛)'s The Grandmasters 《一代宗师》 has been unreasonably potent. So much so that I would only be too happy to put it right at the top of the "Most Anticipated Film of 2011", knowing that I can't, given the infamously long filming and production period that the much-lauded director is renowned for (his critically acclaimed pseudo-Sci-Fi film was so dreadfully delayed that it became an in-joke that the title would actually refer to the year of release).
With The Grandmasters, Wong took on an aspect of a popular film genre in Hong Kong that he had never touched on in his prolific career: Kung fu action. And in an interesting eventual development, the film is the biopic of Yip Man (葉問), better known as Ip Man in the popular Ip Man film series loosely based on the life of Yip Man, starring Donnie Yen as the celebrated martial artist. While the rivalry between both competing productions are well-documented, it is noteworthy that Wong was indeed the first person to thought of filming a biopic of the martial artist who was previously only well-known for being Bruce Lee's real-life master back in 1997.

The functional manipulation and transformation of light in optical circuits is an exciting area of research that combines the physics of light and matter in unusual ways. At the cutting edge of this technology, researchers are exploring new structural combinations of materials that could give rise to potentially useful functions, particularly in nanoscale systems.
Joel Kwang Wei Yang, Zhaogang Dong and their colleagues at A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering have been working on highly precise techniques for patterning thin gold films with nanoscale groove structure to enhance light interaction and produce light resonance effects known as plasmonics.
In collaboration with researchers from the National University of Singapore, Imperial College London and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, Yang and Dong fabricated, analyzed and modelled a system consisting of the nano-grooved gold film topped with an atomically thin flake of tungsten selenide (WSe2). The result was a remarkable 7,000-fold multiplication of an effect called second harmonic generation (SHG), by which two photons combine to produce a single photon with double the energy (or frequency).
Notably, the sample survived both the transfer onto a separate transparent substrate and many bending cycles without degradation in SHG emission, making it a potentially resilient and versatile platform for further development.

Another amazing score by Morricone that sweeps you away at the conclusion of the film. It depicts the powerful impact a paternal influence can have and reminds us not to cut out the moments of love from our life, even though they may be painful. Il Postino and Cinema Paradiso share several similar elements, but I feel ll Postino's love letter to poetry is more convincing than Paradiso's tribute to movies.

Though a grassroots effort to save the Albee failed, the message was clear: Cincinnatians were finally talking about the importance of historic preservation. In a final attempt to protect something from the old movie house from being lost forever, the Albee's iconic facade was saved and mounted to the south side of the Duke Energy Convention Center for parked cars in the adjacent parking lot to appreciate. It still awkwardly looms over Fifth Street today.
But the Albee is just one footnote in the long history of long-gone American theaters. Old single-screen movie houses built in the early 1900s through the 1940s were slowly blinked out of existence up through the late-90s. The Marianne in Bellevue, the Bijou and the Lyric downtown, and over a hundred others around the area ran their last reels over the ensuing decades.
But for at least one of those shuttered theaters, the hard lesson learned from the Albee's demise lingered. When Clifton's Esquire Theatre closed its doors, the community cheered for a sequel long after the credits rolled. But seeing it reopened wasn't easy. A years-long fight ensued that involved a powerful redhead with pigtails, the Ohio Supreme Court, and a cadre of determined Cliftonites who sought to keep french fries from replacing the popcorn—and the neighborhood itself.
The Esquire Theatre opened as a single-screen house in 1911 and initially played silent films along with hosting vaudeville acts. It wasn't until 16 years later

One day in 1942, I was so anxious to see Marcel Carne's Les Visiteurs du Soir, which at last had arrived at my neighborhood theater, the Pigalle, that I decided to skip school. I liked it a lot. But that same evening, my aunt, who was studying violin at the Conservatory, came by to take me to a movie; she had picked Les Visiteurs du Soir. Since I didn't dare admit that I had already seen it, I had to go and pretend that I was seeing it for the first time. That was the first time I realized how fascinating it can be to probe deeper and deeper into a work one admires, that the exercise can go so far as to create the illusion of reliving the creation.
A year later, Clouzot's Le Corbeau turned up; it fascinated me even more. I must have seen it five or six times between the time of its release (May 1943) and the Liberation, when it was prohibited. Later, when it was once again allowed to be shown, I used to go to see it several times a year. Eventually I knew the dialogue by heart. The talk was very adult compared to the films I had seen, with about a hundred words whose meaning I only gradually figured out. Since the plot of Le Corbeau revolved around an epidemic of anonymous letters denouncing abortion, adultery, and various other forms of corruption,

Note: This is a box set consisting of 5 DVD's. Each episode runs for approximately 1 hour. All episodes are narrated in English.
This opening of The Story of Film: An Odyssey shows the birth of a great new art form, the movies. Filmed in the very buildings where the first movies were made, it shows that ideas and passion have always driven film, more than money and marketing. We hear the story of the very first movie stars, close-ups and special effects and then we travel to Hollywood to see how it became a myth. The story is full of surprises, such as the fact that the greatest, and best, paid writers in these early years were women. And then there’s the glamour: the building of the great movie cathedrals.
The 1920s were a golden age for world cinema. In this part, we visit Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Shanghai and Tokyo to discover the places where movie makers were pushing the boundaries of the medium.

It might sound a bit strange to many but if you are to believe many in this ever popular market, classic movie posters are a great, hassle free and enjoyable investment.
Remember Dracula, starring Bela Lugosi, an actor synonymous with not just the Dracula role but early horror films? A classic horror movie poster from the 1931 movie, of which only 3 originals have surfaced, recently sold for over three hundred thousand dollars at an online auction house. Not too shabby for a movie poster.
There are a few factors affecting the prices of classic movie posters. Firstly is the rarity of the poster as posters from the earliest periods of cinema, as exemplified in the case of the 1931 version of Dracula, are extremely hard to find, especially one in good condition.
The formatting of the poster is also important as different sizes and shape represent different periods of cinema from different countries over the last century. Again this means many rare posters also come in a discontinued format. There is a healthy market online for posters known as daybills, one sheets, inserts and half sheets. All these posters were produced in small volumes unlike today’s films where a print run for a worldwide release runs into the hundreds of thousands.
Another factor, and we know you have been waiting for it, is the movie itself. A classic movie produces classic movie posters and they are always in high demand especially originals and not dime a dozen reprints. Think of original posters from

Neorealism, they call it; a style of filmmaking meant to emphasize the struggles of everyday life, and downplay the dramatic lighting and editing that the Americans and Russians had been using. This technique produced powerful films like Roberto Rossellini’s Rome, Open City, Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Theives, and Federico Fellini’s The Nights of Cabiria.
These films stripped away the pomp and circumstance, which left the viewer only with a sense of the struggle of a post-war and post-Mussolini Italy ripe with economic trouble and uncertainty. These films are frequently considered to be a preamble of sorts to the French New Wave, and many of the smaller New Waves around Europe.
This style, as all of them do, became so ubiquitous that many filmmakers sought to challenge this status quo. Fellini’s later films, as well as those of Michelangelo Antonioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini (who began his career writing for Fellini), began to stretch neorealism to fit their visions. By the time the 1970s appeared, two new genres directly opposed to neorealism took center stage.
The “Spaghetti Western” films of Sergio Leone stretched out the moment. Instead of wanting film to have the same speed as life, Leone slowed his films down. The climax of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is so slow and tense that it seems to go on forever.

Tarantino is the Headmaster of the School, but his films have such great style that the substance doesn’t even matter. As such, followers of this School (many of them triple-named, like Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, Lars Von Trier, and Refn himself) ought to have their own unique flashy style, lest they want to become pale imitators of what has already been done.

In that same era, American painter Abbott Handerson Thayer was creating a lot of paintings of angels. He later became known for his influence on the development of military camouflage.
During the late 1800s, Thayer focused on disruptive patters in nature, and began experimenting with countershading. He was convinced that the military would benefit from the use of these patterns to camouflage troops and vessels. He proposed this to the military twice unsuccessfully.
A salient example of this is in a couple of photographs Thayer sent to the military showing how disruptive patterns could camouflage troops. To make his patterned clothing, Thayer covered his jacket with rags and patches and painted his face with grease in a manner similar to that of contemporary battle camouflage.
Though Thayer did not succeed, he eventually filed a patent for treating ships to make them less visible in 1902. His writing on disruptive patterns later inspired British artist Norman Wilkinson.
Thayer’s research and writings seemed to have inspired Wilkinson since the term “razzle dazzle” was used by Thayer to describe disruptive patterns in nature. In 1918, Wilkinson succeeded in convincing the British military to use the razzle dazzle pattern on their ships by proving that U-boats could not properly determine the exact location of a ship clad in this pattern. The margin of error for a torpedo to hit its target is 8º. What does that mean? If a U-boat determines the distance between their own vessel and

The Torchbearers blends documentary and musical forms, shedding light on the vital role that the art of cabaret has played: introducing new social concepts and mores to the mainstream, putting politics in perspective, and serving as a platform for some of the best and brightest talent. Many of cabaret's recent top performers, writers, producers, and reviewers show how cabaret is "an intimate and raw romance between artist and audience; a highwire act with no net (and a two-drink minimum)."

The Ferry will have the dazzle livery design renewed when it goes in for its regular out-of-water survey in February.

The look I created is a peachy gold smokey eye. Gold Dust is more on the coral/peachy side instead of being a true gold. I paired it with Razzle Dazzle, a blackened green with bronze sparkles. I also used Gold Rush, a soft kohl eye liner from Color Studio on the lower lash line. I didn’t get any fallout since I kept tapping off the excess from my brush. I find that using a sponge tip applicator really packs on the color without having any fallout since these are on the powder side.
I first started off by packing on Gold Dust by Color Studio Professional all over the lid as well as the inner corner with a sponge tip applicator.
Using a blending brush, take a small amount of Razzle Dazzle by Color Studio Professional and start applying this on the outer corner blending it into Gold Dust. Take your time with this step since Razzle Dazzle needs to be packed on a bit to get the best color payoff.

Naval fleets once were the largest painting canvases in the world.
War has inspired many great artistic moments but how often have artists returned the favor? Once, as far as I can tell. During World War I Modernism descended on Allied naval planners with a bang (sorry about that), turning fleets into the largest painting canvases in the world.
Like most of us, The Allies only turned to modern art out of desperation. German U-boats were sinking enormous amounts of shipping and there was no really effective defense against them. It is axiomatic that if you can't stop the people who are shooting at you, you should make it very hard for them to find you. Thus, camouflage.
Most camouflage is based on the idea of concealment and blending in with its surroundings. However another school of thought has argued for making the item in question appear to be a mashup of unrelated components. Naval camoufleurs found this theory particularly appealing. Blending didn't work because ships operated in two different and constantly changing color environments – sea and sky. Any camo that concealed in one environment was usually spectacularly conspicuous in others.
Norman Wilkinson, a British naval officer and painter, suggested a scheme that came to be known as Dazzle or Razzle Dazzle painting. Wilkinson believed that breaking up a ship's silhouette with brightly contrasting geometric designs would make it

The headlong rush, the rapid montage, the soaring superhero, the plunging roller coaster—Matters of Gravity focuses on the experience of technological spectacle in American popular culture over the past century. In these essays, leading media and cultural theorist Scott Bukatman reveals how popular culture tames the threats posed by technology and urban modernity by immersing people in delirious kinetic environments like those traversed by Plastic Man, Superman, and the careening astronauts of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Right Stuff. He argues that as advanced technologies have proliferated, popular culture has turned the attendant fear of instability into the thrill of topsy-turvydom, often by presenting images and experiences of weightless escape from controlled space. Considering theme parks, cyberspace, cinematic special effects, superhero comics, and musical films, Matters of Gravity highlights phenomena that make technology spectacular, permit unfettered flights of fantasy, and free us momentarily from the weight of gravity and history, of past and present. Bukatman delves into the dynamic ways pop culture imagines that apotheosis of modernity: the urban metropolis. He points to two genres, musical films and superhero comics, that turn the city into a unique site of transformative power. Leaping in single bounds from lively descriptions to sharp theoretical insights, Matters of Gravity is a deft, exhilarating celebration of the liberatory effects of popular culture.

Here’s how we rank the superhero movies of 2018.
An animated movie taking the top spot on this list — when animation at times has been an afterthought in superhero entertainment — shows how special “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” is. From the top-notch voice cast to the groundbreaking visual imagining of this universe, this movie is the beginning of a franchise with unlimited potential from Sony Pictures Animation.
Bold, black and a boom at the box office. Director Ryan Coogler guided a story that was surprisingly deep emotionally and sociologically, with plot points ranging from father/son issues to the divide between African and its diaspora. The women of Wakanda were leaders both as warriors in battle and in the science lab. “Black Panther” also proved that when the original Avengers ride off into the sunset (by retirement or Thanos snap), there will be a new generation of heroes ready to lead Marvel Studios into the future.
Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment, under the direction of James Wan and the influence of Geoff John’s Aquaman comics, proved they can still be a major player in superhero cinema despite deservedly creating doubts among fans the last few years. “Aquaman” showed that “Wonder Woman” isn’t DC’s only franchise worthy of a sequel and that their superhero films can be bright, inspirational, fun and not nearly as moody as they’ve been in the past.

Yes, this is a very big freakin’ deal.
For those people who are behind the times and haven’t the slightest idea of who The Black Panther is, I say shame on you; however, I will try to do my best to bring those people hip to the game with a brief synopsis: The Black Panther, also known as T’Challa, is the first black superhero in mainstream American comics with superpowers. Created by Marvel comic super duo Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first made his appearance in 1966 in the Fantastic Four comic series.
As the legend goes, T’Challa is a super genius warrior king of the African nation Wakanda, which of course is the most technologically advanced nation on Earth. Thanks in part to a huge meteorite made up of Vibranium that crashed into Wakanda, the country is rich with resources too. As such, the Black Panther is charged with protecting the kingdom from foreigners (ahem…America), who seeks to manipulate and/or destroy Wakanda for these valuable resources.

The first animated series was simply titled Spider-Man, and ran on ABC from 1967 to 1970. The show's first season was produced by Grantray-Lawrence Animation, which soon went bankrupt. In 1968, animator Ralph Bakshi took over. Bakshi's episodes, which suffered from extremely low budgets, were stylized and featured dark ominous settings and pervasive background music. One episode reused complete background animation, characters, and storyline from an episode of Rocket Robin Hood. The series may be best remembered for its theme song. The background underscore is wildly popular in many circles, and a cult of fans have devoted a great deal of time to unearthing the whereabouts of the hard to find background music and exposing its virtues. Spider-Man was voiced by Paul Soles.
Spider-Man also made two guest appearances in the Spider-Woman animated series, where he was also voiced by Soles.

Parents need to know that this anime adventure series is heavy on fantasy violence, although without excessive detail or gore. The show's anime stylings mean it's more intense than superhero series aimed at a younger audience; while teen viewers should be able to handle it, younger viewers may find it too complex and immersive. As they have in films and previous TV series, the lead characters act as an allegory for misunderstood teenagers, with mutant powers that make them both remarkable and repugnant to society at large.
Superhero battles involve a heavy level of violence. Action sequences last for longer periods than on some other superhero shows, and acts of violence are occasionally central to the show's plot -- for example, a lead character's death inspires the team to go on a hiatus in the show's early episodes.
"Damn," "hell," and "crap" are heard occasionally.

The award will be given out at tonight’s annual awards ceremony at the Guild’s Los Angeles headquarters.
DC Comics Co-Publisher Dan DiDio will present the Guild’s AWC lifetime achievement award to Wein’s widow, Christine Valada, in recognition of his significant impact on animation, as well as the legacy of his work. Wein passed away this past September at age 69. The evening will also include a special appearance by the creators and cast of The Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast, as well as video tributes from Wolverine star Hugh Jackman, who portrayed the iconic Wolverine character in blockbuster superhero movies from 2000’s X-Men through 2017’s Logan, and novelist-screenwriter Neil Gaiman (American Gods, How to Talk to Girls at Parties, Good Omens).
Wein conceived and penned stories for both Marvel and DC, as well as Disney, and worked on numerous superhero comics, from Batman and Superman to Spiderman, Thor, Daredevil, and the Justice League of America, over the course of his decades-long career. He co-created Wolverine with artists John Romita, Sr. and Herb Trimpe, who would become one of the most iconic comic superheroes and X-Men characters, as well as Marvel’s premier female superhero Storm. Wein was also instrumental in reviving Marvel’s X-Men comic book franchise. Working with writer-artist Dave Cockrum and Marvel editor Roy Thomas, he revamped the X-Men in 1975, adding new characters – including Nightcrawler, Colossus, and

I love your gorgeous illustrations 🙂 This is so exciting, I hope Venus doesn’t get into trouble!
Oh shoot, this just got real.
Are they going to get caught!
Well, well, well, how is she going to get out of this one? She could say that she was concerned for the fishes safety. I think that they really should have an evacuation plan for the fishes – if the whole place burned to the ground, the glass tanks would break or melt, or shatter, or the water would heat up. Any which way, the fish would be in trouble, so I think, you know, she could say that. That could be her story. Plausible… ?

We all knew what Hasbro was. Their name was on a lot of the toys we were beginning to outgrow, like G.I. Joe, Battlestar Galactica, Chutes and Ladders, Battleship, etc. The implication was immediate and obvious: there must be some Star Blazers toys in the works. Why else would a toy company get involved?
In the days before home video was commonplace, this was even better than Star Blazers toys; it was a chance to relive the series itself on a scene-by-scene basis. Moreover, it was proof that Star Blazers hadn’t been a mere dream. Someone with publishing power knew there was a void to be filled and had taken steps to do just that. Naturally, it could only have been Yoshinobu Nishizaki.
Most of us in-the-know had already heard of Books Nippan, the company who was selling these books in America. In the early 80s, they were THE source for anime books, LPs, and other rare treasures. But “W.C.C. Animation Comics” was a bit of a mystery. Only with the proper context could you work out that this stood for “West Cape Corporation,” the name of Nishizaki’s own company. (“Nishizaki” literally translates to “West Cape.”) What this all boiled down to was that Nishizaki had figured out
