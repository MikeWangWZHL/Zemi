To the men he led he was a hero, and even after his death he was still loved by all his former troops. He was a man who put everyone above himself. This paper will explore the life of Robert E. Lee.
Early Years On January 19, 1807, Ann Carter Lee's fourth child was born as Robert Edward Lee, named after her two brothers. In the spring of 1809, Robert E Lee was finally getting his first impression of Stratford, his boyhood home, marveling at its beauty. His father, Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee, one of the great heroes of the American Revolution, had hit a humiliating and embarrassing point in his life. He was in serious debt. Everything that could be sold was taken to pay his debts, and finally on April 11, 1809, he was arrested for a debt of $5400 with seven years interest on it.
It was not until 1810 that he was released from prison. With absolutely nothing left, Henry Lee finally decided to leave his family because he was unable to provide them with the necessities of life. Everything was left to Ann Carter Lee in a trust fund that was set up by her father; when the estate was settled, the money that she would have would provide for Ann Carter Lee, but Henry was unable to touch it (Freeman, 5).

Attacking homophobia was always a driving force in the earliest stages of creating the show. In conceiving Empire, I knew there would be a gay son that our hip-hop mogul would be loathe to accept. I had been working with Lee Daniels on the film The Butler, and he had told me numerous stories about his father beating him when he was a kid because he knew Lee was gay, even as a child. I had always been deeply moved by these tragic tales, and they made Lee the first person I thought of to collaborate with on my hip-hop idea.

The interaction of antiparallel transverse domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires was investigated via micromagnetic simulation with systematic variations of the external field strength as well as the wire thickness. The interaction of antiparallel transverse walls after domain wall collision exhibited damped multiple collisions due to the rigid structure of the antiparallel transverse walls. The detailed process during the multiple collisions was analyzed via the Fast Fourier Transform technique, along with a careful examination of the inner spin structures of the colliding domain walls. It was found that a frequency peak of multiple collisions shifted to a higher peak position as the external field strength increases. With a stronger field strength of around a few hundred mT, it was found that two antiparallel transverse walls were finally annihilated with formation of complex antivortex structures.

Belinda Love's death would be difficult at any time, but as Georgia recently revealed on The Project, it came just 24 hours after the finale of the reality show aired.
Opening about the traumatic event, she said 'one of the happiest moments' (i.e. when her and Lee could share their hidden romance with the world), was swiftly followed by heartbreak. Shortly after the finale aired, Georgia got the dreaded phone call.
Reflecting on the moment, Georgia said: "We could finally be in the same room together and tell each other how we feel and relax. And literally 24 hours later I got the worst phone call of my life. It's been incredibly difficult, but would have just been made so much more difficult if Lee had not been there.

This quick guide offers a helpful overview of how to access Sydney's many transportation options, ensuring travelers spend more time exploring than feeling confused and frustrated. Happy travels!
Often the quickest means of public transportation, train travel costs approximately the same fare as a bus ride. The Sydney trains are clean, cost effective, fast, and operate on-time. The downside being, as expected, the limited station options, but it's easy to transfer between busses and trains when accessing a destination that's off route. Trains are the best option when heading out of the city to regions like Hunter Valley and The Blue Mountains. Train tickets can be purchased in station or travelers can use the Opal card.
While a taxi may be most convenient, it will also be the most costly. Unless traveling a minimal distance with a few other passengers, a taxi in Sydney is the least economical option.

The ship had great success in the first years of World War II, but controversy and mystery surrounds the loss of Sydney and its crew in November 1941. Its sinking with all hands represents the greatest ever loss of life in an Australian warship; Sydney was also the largest vessel of any country to be lost with no survivors during the war.
And now it seems the vessel may just have been found, some distance north of Cape Inscription on Dirk Hartog Island. To me, this seems to be very close inshore for a naval wreck as a result of a major sea battle.1 Still, given the description of the battle itself, it‚Äôs likely the action took place a few hundred kilometres north-west and Sydney was trying to reach shore before succumbing to her wounds.

For years two children of a Coptic Orphans supporter dropped various coins‚Äî20 cents with a platypus, a dollar with its kangaroos, plus many others‚Äîinto their football bank. These two lost their father when just children, and they experienced a difficult childhood while their mother struggled to make ends meet.

It‚Äôs true, dental implants are not cheap ‚Äì the training, procedure and equipment required means that there is a sizeable cost involved. All is not lost, however, as a payment plan can help.
There is no need to be scared off by cost when considering dental implants in Sydney CBD. Many dental practices, such as Spa Dental Syndey CBD, offer their patients a payment plan. Practices who have partnered with National Dental Plan are able to offer up to $9000 of treatment, with the cost split into affordable fortnightly payments. Even better, with the National Dental Plan there is no interest to pay. There are, of course, lending criteria to be met, so anyone wanting to take advantage of a payment plan should speak to their dentist about applying.
Dental implants in Sydney CBD may not be cheap, but they should be looked at as a lifetime investment. When they can give the patient confidence in their smile, as well as safeguarding remaining natural teeth from future decline, it is easy to see how the cost can be justified. For younger people who have suffered an accident and lost a tooth or teeth, the knock to their confidence and self-esteem can be considerable.

His teachers at Juilliard labeled him a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù early on and his genius lit up the stages and screens of the world for over 30 years.
While Robin Williams was known as a genuinely funny and quick-witted man, it is important to understand that the nature of his genius derived from the study and practice he put into his craft. While he was the master of improv, it came from a genuine drive to excel at comedic art. He drew his material from his own life and from observations of life around him; but he also recognized the influence of other comedians on his work and actively studied how they handled their craft. One of the reasons that Robin Williams became such a superstar of comedy was the dedication he had to his craft. He took a native genius for comedy and learned the skills to make it into an art.

After portraying Robert Scorpio and Anna Devane‚Äôs daughter on and off for more than 25 years, Robin can probably come and go as she pleases from the show. While most every soap character can be recast, Kimberly is about as safe as it gets from that ever happening to her beloved Robin. As she put it recently, every character can be recast bust some just shouldn‚Äôt be.
So as Robin left presumably to find and bring back the character of Jason, writers‚Äô were left with the task of figuring out what to do with her onscreen husband, Patrick (played by Jason Thompson). The last time that Kimberly left, Robin was presumed dead and so Patrick went through the whole grieving process. This time the writers have decided that in order to keep him front and center and to keep his story moving they will have him involved in other story lines rather than having the loss of Robin be his story line.
According to the March 17th print edition of Soap Opera Digest Kimberly is well aware of how much the fans want a happy ending for Robin and Patrick but she is glad that they don‚Äôt have that. It means that Jason gets to keep doing a bang up job as Patrick onscreen. He started off as filler and thanks to Jason‚Äôs portrayal, Patrick has

Participant or Performer: Read by Suzanne Elise Freeman.
Summary: In this evocative first novel, a young woman returns to her rural Vermont hometown in the wake of a devastating storm to search for her missing mother and unravel a powerful family secret. It's August 2011, and Tropical Storm Irene has just wreaked havoc on Vermont, flooding rivers and destroying homes. One thousand miles away-while tending bar in New Orleans-Vale receives a call and is told that her mother, Bonnie, has disappeared. Despite a years-long estrangement from Bonnie, Vale drops everything and returns home to look for her. Though the hometown Vale comes back to is not the one she left eight years earlier, she finds herself falling back into the lives of the family she thought she'd long since left behind. As Vale begins her search, the narrative opens up and pitches back and forth in time to follow three generations of women-a farming widow, a back-to-the-land dreamer, and an owl-loving hermit-as they seek love, bear children, and absorb losses. All the while, Vale's search has her unwittingly careening toward a family origin secret more stunning than she ever imagined. Written with a striking sense of place, Heart Spring Mountain is an arresting novel about returning home, finding hope in the dark, and of the power of the land-and the stories it harbors-to connect and to heal. It's also an absorbing exploration of the small fractures that can make families break-and the lasting ties that bind them together.

Gaseous emissions from metallurgical coke in the presence of slag were much higher than those from coke alone indicating significant carbon/slag interactions with the system exhibiting extensive/rapid iron oxide reduction, very high rates of gas generation but poor gas entrapment within the slag phase. High levels of gas generation led to a strong likelihood of convective transport of reactants and products across the metallurgical coke/slag interface with oxides present in coke ash partially dissolving in molten slag and modifying slag composition. Natural graphite on the other hand showed slow rates of gas generation, slow reduction of iron oxide and excellent gas entrapment. Gases generated from graphite alone were comparable to those generated in the presence of slag and were an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding emissions from metallurgical coke/slag system. Slag interactions with metallurgical coke resulted in lower surface tension due to pickup of silica from coke ash and small droplet volumes; slag interactions with natural graphite gave rise to minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels and increases in droplet volumes. The rate of gas generation was found to be an important parameter in carbon/slag interactions and needs to be maintained at optimum levels for sustaining gas entrapment within slag over extended periods.

the 8th badge of any region allows full control no matter the level however Charizard was still disobedient even after Ash got Kanto's Earth Badge.
So what caused Charmeleon to become so disobedient to Ash?
I think of it as like Charmeleon was like a teenager. It had paid attention to Ash when it was young and naive, because it Ash showed it caring and love. However, when it got older, and learned more, it became cocky and saw Ash for what he was-- a rookie trainer that was still learning many of the basics. I think Charmeleon felt as if he didn't have any respect for Ash. When he started listening to Ash in the Orange Islands, it was after he saw how dedicated and serious Ash could be, even to something that was repeatedly rude and menacing to him. I think that when Charizard saw Ash doing that, he began to have some respect and admiration for the boy.

This all-purpose seasoning sauce with a robust flavor and a rich color is made from fresh oyster extracts and has no added preservatives. Strictly selected and extracted on the day of harvest, only fresh oysters of the highest quality are handpicked by professional oyster quality assessors.
You'd think that Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Oyster Sauce was the result of many years of study, but it was actually discovered by accident. True story: The world's first oyster sauce was invented by Lee Kum Kee. Its founder, Lee Kum Sheung, was cooking some oyster soup. He lost track of time, until he noticed a strong aroma coming from the pot. When he lifted the lid, the normally clear oyster soup had already turned into a thick, brownish sauce. This flavorful seasoning soon became a hit among the locals. In 1888, Lee founded the Lee Kum Kee Oyster Plant to manufacture and sell oyster sauce‚Äîand the rest is history.
In a bowl, mix together Lee Kum Kee Soy Sauce, vinegar, black pepper, garlic, and bay leaf. Marinate chicken and pork for 30 minutes.
Drain chicken and pork. Set aside marinade.
In a pan, heat oil and saut√© the chicken and meat until golden brown. Pour in marinade, sugar, and Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Oyster Sauce. Simmer until sauce thickens.

In this episode, we will build the Intelle-T‚Äîan intelligent tea bag container that estimates the number of tea bags left and will inform us as we start to run out!

You can check out the full schematic for this project on Scheme-It!
The Intelle-T is a tea bag box sitting on an electronic scale that estimates the number of tea bags by weight. The user first turns on the Photon and then places a single tea bag into the pot. From there, the user can fill the container and the system can make an estimate on how many bags remain.
When the user opens the lid a small contact/reed switch is broken, informing the Arduino Uno the container has been opened. This opening action triggers the Raspberry Pi to play a witty message about how great Britain truly is, a fun fact about tea, or how coffee is an inferior beverage.
If the number of teabags begins to fall below a predetermined threshold, the Raspberry Pi will inform the user that the number of teabags is becoming dangerously low.

It is closely attached to the inner wall of the mold and is demolded by cooling to obtain various hollow products. The manufacturing process of the blown film is very similar in principle to the blow molding of hollow products, but it does not use a mold.

Born in San Francisco, California , he worked at a variety of jobs but began his entertainment career as a vaudeville performer that led to the motion picture business. His sister Blanche married Samuel Goldwyn and in 1913 Lasky and Goldwyn teamed with Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar Apfel to form the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company. With limited funds, they rented a barn near Los Angeles where they made Hollywood's first feature film, DeMille's The Squaw Man. Known today as the Lasky-DeMille Barn , it is home to the Hollywood Heritage Museum .
In 1916 their company merged with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company to create the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. They built a large studio facility in Astoria, New York , now known as the Kaufman Astoria Studios . In 1927, Lasky was one of the thirty-six people who founded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Financial problems arose within the industry as a result of the Great Depression and the Famous Players-Lasky Company went into receivership in 1933.

Whatever the reason, however, Macbeth accepted Duncan as King. Perhaps his newness as Mormaer and the need to get to grips with ruling Moray softened the blow, though ambition remained.
Duncan was not a successful King and his prestige must have been dealt a severe blow when he suffered defeat during an attempted siege of Durham in 1039. This may have been the trigger for Macbeth, either acting alone or with the knowledge of other nobles, to rebel against the King who lacked the prowess and success expected of a Celtic warlord.
In 1040 King Duncan led a force into Moray, perhaps to bring a rebellious Macbeth to heel. In August 1040 Macbeth defeated and killed Duncan at Pitgaveny near Elgin then moved quickly to Scone where he was inaugurated King in the traditional way at the Moot Hill.

After analyzing Europe and the Near East as analytical concepts, the lecture focuses on the Balkans as the posited intermediary space between them.

The case is made for the advantages in utilizing the concept of historical legacy as an analytical tool over ‚Äúpath dependence,‚Äù as well as over more structural categories of analysis, such as borders, space, and territoriality, because it allows to articulate more clearly the dynamism and fluidity of historical change.

Trilliums of various sorts can be found in forests throughout North America. The large flowered wake-robin is probably the showiest one. It is certainly the most widely cultivated. Wake-robin blooms for several weeks in midspring.
Description of wake-robin: With wake-robins, almost everything comes in threes. Each plant produces a single stem bearing a whorl of three deep green, pointed leaves. The leaves are topped by three green sepals that open to reveal a pure white flower with three broad, pointed petals. The long-lasting flower turns pink as it ages. The plant sprouts in early spring, quickly reaches 8 to 18 inches in height, and then blooms. In dry conditions, it dies back to a tuberous root by midsummer. Ease of care of wake-robin: Easy.
Growing wake-robin: Plant in rich, moist, well-drained soil. Apply a thick mulch to imitate the deep leaf litter of the plant's native habitat. If conditions suit it, the wake-robin spreads abundantly but never aggressively.
Propagating wake-robin: By division or seed. Plants take five to seven years to bloom from seed.
Uses for wake-robin: In forests, the wake-robin can become so numerous that the forest floor seems covered with snow during the plant's blooming season. It can also be grown in beds and borders. Although it would seem to be an attractive cut flower, harvesting it means cutting its leaves as well. This deprives the root of its nourishment, leading to the plant's demise.

Before his wife gave birth, Padilla, who is now a proud father even posted a video of the conversation between him and his beautiful wife, Mariel. It was taken while she was in labor. A support from far was part of the process.
In the video, Padilla conveyed his most sincere sorry to his wife for not being able to be next to her to comfort and ease the pain through moral support. This is due to his unforeseen denial of a US Visa from the government of the country.

This may seem like a small sign or factor, but it has a grave effect. Those who live with depression in an unrevealing way can sometimes only let the little signs show. Sleeping too much or too little are textbook examples. The same goes for eating too little or too much. Sleep and nutrition are two critical elements to health. They are also two elements that the human mind can attempt to control. Depression creates a suffocating lack of control, and being able to control at least something, can be all a person has. Sleep can be nearly impossible, or it can be the only escape. The same goes for eating.
Not every person with depression has felt suicidal. However, depression often invokes a unique and complex thought process about life in general. Facing one‚Äôs mortality often comes at moments of desperation. It happens when you are furiously seeking answers to all of life‚Äôs questions.

In fact, without this enthusiastic trust in characters, popular stories such as Star Wars, Cinderella or Slumdog Millionaire simply wouldn‚Äôt work. But what‚Äôs the mechanism behind this powerful belief in others?
When I started thinking about this, my hunch was that it could be a type of ‚Äúvicarious optimism‚Äù that we feel for other people. This idea clashes with our current understanding of optimism as a self-centered phenomenon: I believe that good things will happen to me, not you. But my colleagues and I felt that psychologists may have been missing something. We set up a series of experiments to test how far reaching optimism really is.
Readers of fiction need to disregard bad news about the heroes of the story and trust good news in order to believe in a happy ending. This is similar to what people do for themselves. Research has shown that in order to remain optimistic about their own future, people dismiss bad news (things might be worse than expected) and readily incorporate good news (things might be better than expected).
Yet, research also tells us that we do not only care about the future outcomes of ourselves, but also those of others, even strangers. We also know that people have the capability to experience vicarious emotions in response to other people‚Äôs successes and misfortunes. So maybe the feeling of optimism could also extend to others?

Envy is basically feeling sorrow about not having what somebody else has.
To wish something that we do not have can be considered as inherently human since everyone has felt envy at one point or another. However, since we understand that it‚Äôs frowned upon to go around saying that we have negative feelings toward others, instead of admitting we feel envious, we say things like ‚Äúwhite envy‚Äù or that we have the ‚Äúgood kind of envy‚Äù, even though such phrases only accomplish to prevent the other person from imagining us poking our frustrations away at a voodoo doll with his or her shape.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I want‚Äù and ‚ÄúI feel lost‚Äù are common complaints that can cause a great deal of stress. Yet, most of the time, at some level, we actually do know what we want and when we see it or hear it from somebody that is making it happen; we experience the unease of envy.
So, contrary to popular opinion, we should see envy as a light that shows us what we want. A light that lets us see desires we didn‚Äôt even know we had.

Selling land is a lot different than selling a house. The market is typically slower as fewer people are looking for land. It requires an entirely different strategy as well as a fair amount of patience. You can look for a professional land buyer such as REALTRON to quickly take the land off your hands for a fair price, you could try to sell it on your own, or you could work with an agent to try to do it for you. The problem with working with an agent is that most of them are focused on buying and selling homes. Land is a whole different ballgame that requires a unique approach in order to sell for the price you want, in the timeframe you want. Keep reading to learn more about your different selling options for your land in the Austin area.
When you work with a professional buyer such as REALTRON, you can expect a simple and easy transaction.

They find that they are unable to participate in activities as they could when they were younger. By focusing on nutritional approaches to address and correct aging issues, we‚Äôve seen the issues commonly associated with aging, reduce or turn around with our schedule of care.
Eating the right foods, which contain quality protein, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients does not mean you will necessarily absorb them. Under-production of Hydrochloric (stomach) acid due to stress and aging, or stomach acid suppressive therapies, along with a lack of enzymes, leads to mal-absorption of nutrients. One way this is evident is with a decline of muscle mass. Without addressing this, a person can become frail, which means they have inadequate muscle mass for their age. As we lose muscle mass, we begin to more easily accumulate fat since muscle is required to burn fat. Once the stomach‚Äôs acid production is returned to normal levels, and sufficient levels of enzymes are present, we can absorb our nutrients.
Optimal bone health means strong, flexible bones, not necessarily thicker bones, and is dependent upon good digestion, coupled with a variety of nutrients. Studies which include only calcium supplementation show mixed results in restoring healthy bone density. Since our bones require many nutrients, we obtain the best results when we supplement with all of these nutrients.

Brantley extended his on-base streak to 13 games with the home run, his fourth of the season. He's hitting .380 (19-for-51) with two homers and 10 RBI during the on-base streak.
Brantley went 1-for-3 with a walk and an RBI in Wednesday's 2-1 loss to the Athletics.
Brantley has been front-and-center during the Astros' offensive revival over the last two weeks. He's hitting .385 (15-for-39) with eight RBI and seven runs scored over the last 10 games. As Houston's cleanup hitter, Brantley is in position to take advantage of on-base machines ahead of him in the lineup: George Springer, Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman.
Brantley went 3-for-5 with two doubles, an RBI and a run scored in Tuesday's 6-3 win over the Yankees.
Brantley's seventh-inning double plated Alex Bregman, who had doubled before him, to tie the game. The 31-year-old outfielder has hit in four straight, going 8-for-17 with three extra-base hits and four RBI during that run. As Houston's offense slowly emerges from a slumber, Brantley should be presented with plenty of RBI opportunities as the team's cleanup batter.
Brantley went 2-for-4 with a two-run home run and a second run scored in Saturday's 6-0 win over the A's.
The outfielder's second homer of the year was part of a four-run fifth inning that broke the game open. Brantley is only hitting .219 (7-for-32) through nine games to begin his Houston tenure, but he has solid five-category upside as long as he keeps his spot

In the 2018 edition, the match up started very different. Russell County did their best to keep the Rebel offense off the field, but it was coach Steve Stonebraker‚Äôs defense that answered the bell when it came down to it.
The defense did more than their part in conquering the Lakers led by a pair of defenders racking up double-digit tackles (Ethan Ammons, 12 and Reece Brown, 10) while AJ Glenn added a sack to his seven tackles on the evening. Ethan Parton, Josh Blevins, Adam Price, Keegan Hansfordand Gabe Singleton each forced a fumble, recovered a fumbled, grabbed an interception or added a sack for the Casey defense.
Casey didn‚Äôt get their zero off the scoreboard until the mid-way through the second quarter when Preston Tucker ripped off a 45-yard run for a score. A Nick-Wilkerson point after made it 7-0.
With :29 left in the half Russell County scored to tie it up, but that‚Äôs when the fun started for the Casey squad.

In fact, claims Casey, top officials in the Ridge-Schweiker administration are guilty of "dereliction of duty" for allowing a Department of Labor & Industry (L&I) employee to spend nearly $200,000 of public money on inappropriate, unjustified and wasteful expenditures.
The "flagrant misuse of tax dollars" includes at least 1,000 personal cell phone calls to Montana, trips to casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, four coat racks worth $1,300 and novelty clothing items that were given away to colleagues, friends and even a group of square dancers.
As a result of Casey's audit, this official - a former Monroe County commissioner who served as deputy secretary for Safety and Standards from July 2001 to March 2002 and director of the Bureau of Labor Law Compliance (BLLC) from 1995 to July 2001 - has been suspended without pay, but not fired.
"The flagrant misuse of tax dollars at the BLLC was allowed to continue unabated for over 3-1/2 years because top L&I officials and the comptroller's office responsible for auditing L&I did absolutely nothing to scrutinize, question or control the director's inappropriate purchases," Casey said. "The dereliction of duty that occurred at the highest levels of this administration is appalling."
Casey's audit found that the employee used his position of authority and a state credit card to promote a personal agenda, rather than to do his job, which was to enforce the state's prevailing

Individual medical evaluations. Typically, people meet one-on-one with a provider before or after the group session.
Many people say they're happier with group visits. And they often gain skills and confidence to better manage a health condition. What's more, some studies suggest this approach may even help improve patient care and some medical outcomes.

The child was 1300 kilometres into his attempt to drive right across the country.
Police stopped the boy after seeing the vehicle's bumper dragging along the ground.
"Checks revealed the driver was a 12-year-old boy travelling from Kendall NSW on his way to Perth," a police spokesperson told 9 News.
The boy was taken to Broken Hill police station.
He had started his journey in Kendall, a small town on the south of Port Macquarie on the east coast of Australia. The child was arrested in Broken Hill, a city on the state border to South Australia.
The journey between Kendall and Broken Hill takes about 14 hours, but it's just a fraction of distance to Perth, which takes 43 hours of driving.

He scored 18 goals in the last two seasons for the Black Cats and played a key role in the club's successful bid to avoid relegation in the closing weeks of the 2013/14 campaign.
"I spoke to the gaffer last week and he said all the right things about the club and I've got friends here who also told me some very good things," said Wickham.
"I looked at the team before I arrived here and the signings that have been brought in, and the potential to score goals and the chances that could be created was a massive influence. Hopefully I can add to that talent and make the squad stronger.
"I think I needed the fresh start, I had four years up north and it's been a bit stop-start. Now I've come back home and I can settle down and see my family a bit more and hopefully let my football do the talking."
Palace, 1/1 to finish in the top half of the Premier League table in 2015/16 and 1/1 to be relegated, have also signed Yohan Cabaye and Alex McCarthy this summer.

For those of you who don't know what aerial skiing is, it is skiing down a hill, launching off a huge ramp, and twisting and flipping around in the air.
"For me, [aerial skiing] is just plain fun, and like you are flying, then crashing for a few seconds," 18-year-old Alex said. "It has all the excitement of a trampoline, but you are much higher in the air with more flips and twists."
Alex has been on skis since he was 1. He was carried in a backpack when his parents would cross-country ski before advancing to bigger hills, with a leash tied around his waist to keep him from falling.

One of the languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien in Tolkien's legendarium, it was spoken in the realm of Mordor. Tolkien describes the language as being created by Sauron as an (in-universe) constructed language to be the sole language of all the servants of Mordor, thereby replacing (with little success) the many different varieties of Orkish, Common Speech and other languages used by his servants. Tolkien describes the language as existing in two forms, the ancient "pure" forms used by Sauron himself, the Nazg√ªl, and the Olog-hai, and the more "debased" form used by the soldiery of the Barad-d√ªr at the end of the Third Age.
The Black Speech was not intentionally modeled on any style, but was meant to be self consistent, very different from Elvish, yet organized and expressive, as would be expected of a device of Sauron before his complete corruption.

Over 78% of the teachers felt that children faced problems in learning because of the language gap of home and school.
The study recommends that the medium of instruction in anganwadi pre-school centres and primary classes in schools should be in the mother-tongue of children, which is tribal or regional language. The study suggests that material in tribal and regional language should be developed and used in classrooms to bridge gap between the home language and school language. Besides, teachers should be oriented to understand and respect local resources and culture, as well as to communicate with children in local language.

¬´Bl√•b√¶r og aske¬ª (¬´Bilberry and Ash¬ª) is a composition of fragile paintings hung on the walls of Prosjektrom Normanns. The work is made repeating one simple process: Extract of bilberry (European blueberry) and wood ash dissolved in water are mixed together and poured on to a sheet of wrapping tissue paper. The pigment that gives bilberries their distinct colour is ph sensitive. Increasing the proportion of ash, which is a base, changes the colour from a bright red to shades of purple, blue, and green, until it degrades into a pale brown.

A child suffering from kwashiorkor has a swollen head; protruding tummy, drastic weight loss and light reddish hair.

Unfortunately for the project, in early 1995 I went to work for FMA Ltd, probably Scotland's first web consultancy (and for the first year or so, technical support for Demon Internet's commercial web business). This caused the book to slide, so that it wasn't published until 1996, by which time it was trampled in the rush.
This book is now so thoroughly obsolete that it isn't even an embarrassment any more: it's an historical artefact. While I've discussed a second edition with Addison-Wesley, we agreed that it wasn't really practical: and it looks as if I'm not going to have time to follow up an alternative project (for O'Reilly and Associates).

As the second year of the program begins, plans have been made to enhance the effectiveness of the kits through increased parent education. To reach this goal, Austin Aspires is keeping three key insights in mind.
As a community, Austin attributes much of its success to collaboration. Amy Baskin, the community education and communications director at APS, advises keeping an open mind about possibilities for cross-sector solutions.
‚ÄúAre there partners that you can work with, who would those partners be and what do you need to do to get those partners?‚Äù Baskin suggests organizations ask themselves.

Feasibility, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability of the Modified Ashworth Scale and Modified Tardieu Scale in persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.
Waninge A1, Rook RA, Dijkhuizen A, Gielen E, van der Schans CP.
Caregivers of persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) often describe the quality of the daily movements of these persons in terms of flexibility or stiffness. Objective outcome measures for flexibility and stiffness are muscle tone or level of spasticity. Two instruments used to grade muscle tone and spasticity are the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS). To date, however, no research has been performed to determine the psychometric properties of the MAS and MTS in persons with PIMD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability of the MAS and MTS in persons with PIMD. We assessed 35 participants on the MAS and MTS twice, first for the test and second a week later for the retest. Two observers performed the measurements. Feasibility was assessed based on the percentage of successful measurements. Test-retest and interrater reliability were determined by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman's correlation, and either limits of agreement (LOA) or quadratically weighted kappa. The feasibility of the measurements was good, because an acceptable percentage of successful measurements were performed. MAS measurements had substantial to almost perfect quadratically weighted kappa (>0.8) and an acceptable ICC (>0.8) for both inter- and intrarater reliability.

Spinal Cord. 2007 Jan;45(1):112-5. Epub 2006 Mar 7.
STUDY DESIGN: Pre-test, post-test study of the relationship between exercise-related changes in feeling states and pain among persons with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) who performed three separate exercise sessions consisting of body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT).
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exercise-related changes in feeling states are related to exercise-related changes in pain and in-task pain.
METHODS: A total of 14 men and women with chronic, incomplete SCI (ASIA B and C) performed three exercise sessions of BWSTT. Measures of pain and feeling states were administered before and after each session along with a measure of pain experienced while exercising.
RESULTS: Participants who experienced greater decreases in pain from pre- to post-exercise also experienced greater improvements in feeling states. Pain experienced during exercise was unrelated to changes in feeling states.
CONCLUSION: Among persons with SCI, exercise-related changes in pain can influence the effects of individual exercise bouts on feeling states.

The model can show both normal functioning and cases of dysfunctioning, such as can be the case for persons with certain types of dementia. Simulations have been performed to test the model in both these types of behaviours. A mathematical analysis was done which gave evidence that the model as implemented does what it is meant to do. The model can be applied to obtain a virtual patient model to study the way in which recognition of emotions can deviate for certain types of persons.

Retrieved Text: February 2, 2005 (by Chris McGee) - The F/A-22 Raptor, the Air Force's next-generation air superiority fighter, performed well in recently completed operational testing and is on track to go operational in December, the director of the program's combined test force said.
Speaking prior to a lecture he delivered at the National Museum of the United States Air Force here, Lt. Col. Evan Thomas, a Raptor pilot who commands the 411th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., said testing finished ahead of schedule.
"I'm very optimistic," Colonel Thomas said. "The airplane did very well in operational testing."
He said the process of readying the Raptor for its operational testing -- from refining and validating the aircraft's key attributes to training pilots -- proved a significant effort and enabled operational testing to be conducted successfully and ahead of schedule.
Even so, Colonel Thomas said obstacles remain to be cleared between now and December.
"There are still a lot of challenges," he said. "It's going to be an uphill fight throughout this year, not only for us on the Air Force Materiel Command developmental test side, but also for Air Combat Command units standing up the first squadron at Langley (AFB, Va.). These are challenges, but we can (overcome) them."
The 27th Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB -- the first squadron to transition to the Raptor -- received the first operational aircraft Jan. 18 from Tyndall AFB, Fla., where the 43rd Fighter Squadron is training future Raptor pilots.

Hibernating black bears (Ursus americanus) experience skeletal muscle protein balance during winter anorexia.
Lohuis TD1, Harlow HJ, Beck TD.
Black bears spend four to seven months every winter confined to their den and anorexic. Despite potential for skeletal muscle atrophy and protein loss, bears appear to retain muscle integrity throughout winter dormancy. Other authors have suggested that bears are capable of net protein anabolism during this time. The present study was performed to test this hypothesis by directly measuring skeletal muscle protein metabolism during the summer, as well as early and late hibernation periods. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis of six free-ranging bears in the summer, and from six others early in hibernation and again in late winter. Protein synthesis and breakdown were measured on biopsies using (14)C-phenylalanine as a tracer. Muscle protein, nitrogen, and nucleic acid content, as well as nitrogen stable isotope enrichment, were also measured. Protein synthesis was greater than breakdown in summer bears, suggesting that they accumulate muscle protein during periods of seasonal food availability. Protein synthesis and breakdown were both lower in winter compared to summer but were equal during both early and late denning, indicating that bears are in protein balance during hibernation. Protein and nitrogen content, nucleic acid, and stable isotope enrichment measurements of the biopsies support this conclusion.

So it's important to take action to have your home tested and, if necessary, install a radon mitigation system.
Although you may not be able to detect it with any of your human senses, the radon mitigation professionals at National Radon Defense can not only inspect your home's levels but also provide solutions for maintaining a healthy radon level in your Tennessee home. Several highly trained National Radon Defense dealers provide radon testing and radon mitigation services throughout TN, so your home can receive the protection it needs.

Feasibility, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability of the Modified Ashworth Scale and Modified Tardieu Scale in persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.
Waninge A1, Rook RA, Dijkhuizen A, Gielen E, van der Schans CP.
Caregivers of persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) often describe the quality of the daily movements of these persons in terms of flexibility or stiffness. Objective outcome measures for flexibility and stiffness are muscle tone or level of spasticity. Two instruments used to grade muscle tone and spasticity are the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS). To date, however, no research has been performed to determine the psychometric properties of the MAS and MTS in persons with PIMD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability of the MAS and MTS in persons with PIMD. We assessed 35 participants on the MAS and MTS twice, first for the test and second a week later for the retest. Two observers performed the measurements. Feasibility was assessed based on the percentage of successful measurements. Test-retest and interrater reliability were determined by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman's correlation, and either limits of agreement (LOA) or quadratically weighted kappa. The feasibility of the measurements was good, because an acceptable percentage of successful measurements were performed. MAS measurements had substantial to almost perfect quadratically weighted kappa (>0.8) and an acceptable ICC (>0.8) for both inter- and intrarater reliability.

HbA1c test was introduced in clinical use in 1980 & has become a cornerstone of clinical practice.
Do you need to be fasting to do this test?
No. It can be performed at any time of the day & does not require fasting. This has made it the preferred test for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes.
Why HbA1c test is performed?
If you have diabetes, it is done to measure your blood sugar control over the last 2-3 months. This test is also used to screen for diabetes.
The closer your HbA1c is to normal level, the less the risk you have for above complications.
What level of HbA1c is good for a diabetic?
HbA1c above 6.5% is a criterion for diagnosing Diabetes mellitus.
If you have diabetes you try to keep your HbA1c level below 7%.
If your HbA1c is more than 7%, your diabetes control may not be good & you are at greater risk of diabetes complications mentioned above.
How can I reduce my chance of long term complication from diabetes?
If you can bring your HbA1c level down, you decrease your chance of long term complications.
How often should I test HbA1c?
It is recommended that you test HbA1c every 3 months.

Spinal Cord. 2007 Jan;45(1):112-5. Epub 2006 Mar 7.
STUDY DESIGN: Pre-test, post-test study of the relationship between exercise-related changes in feeling states and pain among persons with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) who performed three separate exercise sessions consisting of body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT).
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exercise-related changes in feeling states are related to exercise-related changes in pain and in-task pain.
METHODS: A total of 14 men and women with chronic, incomplete SCI (ASIA B and C) performed three exercise sessions of BWSTT. Measures of pain and feeling states were administered before and after each session along with a measure of pain experienced while exercising.
RESULTS: Participants who experienced greater decreases in pain from pre- to post-exercise also experienced greater improvements in feeling states. Pain experienced during exercise was unrelated to changes in feeling states.
CONCLUSION: Among persons with SCI, exercise-related changes in pain can influence the effects of individual exercise bouts on feeling states.

Speaking prior to a lecture he delivered at the National Museum of the United States Air Force here, Lt. Col. Evan Thomas, a Raptor pilot who commands the 411th Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., said testing finished ahead of schedule.
"I'm very optimistic," Colonel Thomas said. "The airplane did very well in operational testing."
He said the process of readying the Raptor for its operational testing -- from refining and validating the aircraft's key attributes to training pilots -- proved a significant effort and enabled operational testing to be conducted successfully and ahead of schedule.
Even so, Colonel Thomas said obstacles remain to be cleared between now and December.
"There are still a lot of challenges," he said. "It's going to be an uphill fight throughout this year, not only for us on the Air Force Materiel Command developmental test side, but also for Air Combat Command units standing up the first squadron at Langley (AFB, Va.). These are challenges, but we can (overcome) them."

Hibernating black bears (Ursus americanus) experience skeletal muscle protein balance during winter anorexia.
Lohuis TD1, Harlow HJ, Beck TD.
Black bears spend four to seven months every winter confined to their den and anorexic. Despite potential for skeletal muscle atrophy and protein loss, bears appear to retain muscle integrity throughout winter dormancy. Other authors have suggested that bears are capable of net protein anabolism during this time. The present study was performed to test this hypothesis by directly measuring skeletal muscle protein metabolism during the summer, as well as early and late hibernation periods. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis of six free-ranging bears in the summer, and from six others early in hibernation and again in late winter. Protein synthesis and breakdown were measured on biopsies using (14)C-phenylalanine as a tracer. Muscle protein, nitrogen, and nucleic acid content, as well as nitrogen stable isotope enrichment, were also measured. Protein synthesis was greater than breakdown in summer bears, suggesting that they accumulate muscle protein during periods of seasonal food availability. Protein synthesis and breakdown were both lower in winter compared to summer but were equal during both early and late denning, indicating that bears are in protein balance during hibernation. Protein and nitrogen content, nucleic acid, and stable isotope enrichment measurements of the biopsies support this conclusion.

With just over five weeks to go until Britain's EU referendum, opinion polls are giving contradictory indications about the likely outcome of the referendum but some suggest the result will be on a knife-edge.
The leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, said in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday that if the result was as close as 52-48 per cent for "In", the debate would be "unfinished business".
"If the remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it," he told the Daily Mirror.
Asked by a reporter about the comments, Cameron said it showed the "Out" campaign was losing.
"I think when people start arguing for a second referendum before you've even had the first one, I think that clearly demonstrates that you are losing the argument," Cameron told an event hosted by the World Economic Forum.
"I am absolutely clear, a referendum is a referendum, it's a once in a generation, once in a lifetime opportunity and the result determines the outcome... You can't have neverendums, you have referendums."

A good chunk of my childhood was spent ridding our farm fields of milkweed. The sticky, white, latex goo that came with each cut seemed to seep into the soul and glue hand to hoe. As we chopped, my father liked to relate his memories of how the government put out a wartime call to gather milkweed pods so the buoyant floss that filled them could be used to pack life preservers. In the sundrenched days of my youth, I remember hoping for a few escapes. I loved popping the pods open to find the seeds overlapping like scales, just waiting to be unfurled. Dried pods became boats to float down the creek and even decorated our Christmas tree.
Today, there is a new call to bring back milkweed to save the monarch butterfly. The larvae of these magnificent pollinators feed exclusively on milkweed in North America.
"Monarch butterfly populations are declining due to loss of habitat," said Chip Taylor, a University of Kansas University professor and director of Monarch Watch. "To assure a future for monarchs, conservation and restoration of milkweeds needs to be a national priority."
Studies of the annual cycle of the monarch population indicate that the most important region supporting this species is a corridor of milkweed and nectar resources that ranges from Texas to Minnesota.

‚ÄúCat and dog dander is very light and fluffy. It's in the air all the time. The particles don't settle as much and it easily spreads throughout the house. It's hard to avoid,‚Äù Lee says.
For sufferers, the best solution is to not adopt pets. If that is not an option, at least keep animals well groomed and frequently bathed.
Dust mites are another widespread, airborne allergen. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, an estimated 20 million Americans are allergic. They are invisible to the eye and it is impossible to completely eliminate them from one's home.
This makes it easier to minimize the impact. Consistently and thoroughly clean such areas as carpets, furniture and toys. Dust-mite covers for beds can be helpful.
Lastly, the Northwest offers prime conditions for indoor mold, which thrives in warm, damp and humid conditions. Kitchens, bathrooms and basements are particularly susceptible. It also flourishes on paper products, cardboard and ceiling tiles.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, some studies have linked early mold exposure to the development of childhood asthma.

In the first quarter 2018 edition of SPRAYTIME (Published by the International Thermal Spray Association, A Standing Committee of the American Welding Society), Adam Conley is interviewed sharing his knowledge of air handling fans in dust collection systems. Paul Richard, Donaldson Co., Inc., OEM Accounts Manager, explores how local climate affects process exhaust and dust collection systems in his article ‚ÄúLocal Considerations in Thermal Spray Dust Collection‚Äù in SPRAYTIME magazine.
The article addresses design and operation parameters that are sometimes overlooked.
Keeping your dust collection system running optimally, makes it important to review surrounding environmental factors such as temperature, altitude, wind and seismic design, as well as the location or positioning of the physical dust collection system. These parameters have impacts that affect the collection efficiency on the dirty airstream, cleaning of collected particulate from the filter media and the cleaned recirculation airstream or discharge.
Resultant factors that could impact your total collection system include condensation in the duct, dust collector or compressed air line, reduced fan performance as density changes with temperature and elevation, structural integrity of the collector and duct based on weather conditions and potential catastrophic events, electrical power requirement to operate the fan, and compressed air usage.
Mr. Richard presents an important reminder of why and how we need to address these criteria proactively. Understanding and addressing the potential impacts of each one of those factors mentioned will determine the system collection efficiency and time spent maintaining a thermal spray dust collection

Rep. Mia Love is in hot water with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) after her team raised more than a million dollars for a primary election that wasn‚Äôt expected to happen, according to documents obtained by CNN.
Love, who has previously stirred controversy with her gun control views, won a nomination for a third term as Utah‚Äôs 4th congressional district representative at the state‚Äôs nominating convention in April. Candidates who get a nomination at a convention, especially those who do not have challengers, don‚Äôt move forward to a primary election.

Essentially, we talk about the coating cubicle as a well-ventilated space, but it's more than that. It's an airflow management zone, a place that automatically collects any powder that isn't electrostatically gripping the workpiece surface. In this sequence, the walk-in booth uses a filtered and air-dried compressor to discharge the coating. As it accumulates on the surface of a part, the airflow management system actuates a fan. In this manner, any overspray is ejected from the booth, but not lost, not in any way.
At this point, the powder has been expertly ejected, exposed to an electrostatic mechanism, and then the overspray has been collected. Believe it or not, the powder recovery system gets more complicated after the dust is collected. If we're talking about one colour, then the recycling hopper won't be stressed by the powder collection configuration we just described. However, what if there are several powder types in use that day, perhaps for different jobs? The solution is to use advanced dust collectors and cyclones. On the collector, special filter cartridges separate different powder types and send those streams to their assigned collection hoppers. As for the cyclone equipment, this gear uses centrifugal force and gravity to separate powder streams according to their relative density. Primarily, then, the dust clouds are separated from the air stream. As the powder accumulates in the

Although you can polish concrete floors or countertops using either wet or dry methods (see Wet vs. Dry Concrete Polishing), the trend today is to go dry. Not only is this method faster and more convenient, it doesn‚Äôt leave behind the messy slurry that wet polishing creates. Polishing dry, however, does generate a lot of dust, which makes the use of dust-control equipment mandatory to keep the concrete fines from going airborne.
Safety and air quality are the main purposes for dust-collection systems, but keeping enough dust off the floor so that contractors can see the scratch pattern as they grind is also important, says Clark Branum of Diamatic USA. Most grinders for polishing concrete floors don‚Äôt come equipped with an integral dust collection system, which means you‚Äôll have to purchase a separate unit. Some manufacturers will sell dust extractors specifically for use with their machines. But if that‚Äôs not the case, you‚Äôll have to shop around on your own. Here are some tips from Branum for the key features to look for.
How is the dust collected?How the dust is collected -- in a tank or in a bag - is a consideration when it comes to disposal. Branum says the Longopac (a continuous bag system) is the most convenient for clean one-step disposal vs. a standard dust tank, which will require you to empty and dispose of the contents separately. However, if you prefer to go with a dust tank, he recommends a capacity of no more than 50

These things are all true. To nobody's surprise, I violated all these principles by watching Pixar's movie Inside Out at the library this week. Now I am going to squander more attention in writing about it.
The executive summary is that although some aspects of the movie rubbed me the wrong way, for the most part I enjoyed the film. That is not necessarily a good thing.
I went to see the movie because people on the Internet said it portrayed psychological states effectively and accurately. I agree to some extent. The psychological metaphors used in the movie are easy to understand; no doubt brain researchers who graduate from university 10-15 years from now will visualize memory formation in terms of brightly coloured balls. Anthromorphizing the five emotions at "headquarters" mostly worked, as did the concepts of core memories, conceptual islands, and the Subconscious. I get the feeling that this movie provided its audience a language and set of metaphors that can be useful in comprehending and discussing human behaviour effectively. Disney pulled off a mean feat in creating a movie that was educational but not overly didactic.

"The Future" is an example of unadulterated pop brilliance.
The group's first album, 1988's "Guy," virtually rewrote black pop by inventing the genre called New Jack Swing. Since then, Guy's mastermind, the producer and rapper Teddy Riley, has been so widely imitated his trademark sound has become a cliche. Also, dance music, further divorced from the hip hop that informs Mr. Riley's productions, has become a dominant force. "The Future" is an answer to the passage of pop time.
Mr. Riley's musical identity -- dense layers of sound in which bass lines mingle with whispers and sighs -- and his singing approach the listener from various distances. A whomping drumbeat propels everything, with melodies and narrative taking second place to the rhythms. On "The Future," Mr. Riley's genius shows through with songs that update his sound: he adds dance-music textures and, between the rapping and drumbeats, drops scraps of singing by Aaron Hall, who may be the most gifted pop singer to emerge in the late 80's. Fragmented as the songs may be vocally, they are structural masterpieces, combining perfect tempos and rhythms with constantly changing colors.
The album, which clocks in at over 70 minutes, is structured like a gospel service. Emotional highpoints, spurred by uptempo dance tunes, alternate with ballads. There's talking (Mr. Riley alludes to his court case to free himself from his manager), and lyrics move from simple sexuality to simple love. But the relevance isn't in the words. It's in the music, and there's lots of it.

Judge Riley's legal career is reflected in the folders relating to the American Bar Association with special emphasis given to public relations and the legal profession. There are two boxes of programs, minutes, bulletins, correspondence, etc., relating specifically to the Iowa State Bar Association. Many of Riley's addresses -- Riley was a popular speaker -- are preserved, and they mirror his passions: the law, politics, and religion.
One entire box is devoted to Riley's long involvement with the University of Iowa. It includes items ranging from alumni articles of incorporation to School of Religion policies and the Catholic Student Center. Another area of interest for Judge Riley included the Roadside Settlement House Association of which he was a director. There are audits, minutes, reports, and correspondence for this organization which date from 1936 to 1949. His interest and enjoyment of hunting and fishing is seen in a folder on the Iowa State Fish and Game Commission.

Sure enough, Pixar's 15th film is perhaps their most brilliant creation to date, thanks in large part to director Pete Docter's personal touch in his exploration of his daughter's loss of childhood wonder as she traveled through puberty. Told in the mind of its protagonist, Riley, the film focuses on her five key emotions: Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (The Office's Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). The idea is a sheer work of genius, which cannot be stated enough, and its execution is flawless and brilliantly rendered as it always connects the audience to the emotional power of the story. It's also a universally appealing narrative, telling of mood swings and deeply rooted in psychology that probably allows parents and adults to connect far more than children. Regardless, one thing is certain: it's another Pixar masterpiece that reaffirms the company's relentlessly brilliant minds never left.
The story centers on Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), a young hockey-loving girl that gets uprooted from her Midwest life in Minnesota to move to San Francisco for her father's new job. While that is the foundation of the story, and shows the real-life actions that her emotions create, the majority of the film takes place inside Riley's mind. The five emotions inhabit Headquarters, which stores Riley's core memories that create her personality while also sending off memories at the end of the

The two options for filling the vacancy (which expires in 2020) are to appoint a representative or to call a special election.
At their December 18th meeting, City Council deadlocked (2-2) over how to fill the vacancy. Councilmembers Zahra and Whitaker favored a special election, and Mayor Silva and Mayor Protem Fitzgerald favored an appointment.

DPS offered teachers a guaranteed cost of living adjustment for a few years and an extra $3 million for teacher pay, starting with the 2020-2021 school year.
The Denver Classroom Teachers Association released a statement regarding Thursday evening's failed negotiations with Denver Public Schools.
In the statement, the DCTA said they were "disappointed" and DPS did not offer a "serious proposal."
The statement was released to the public by Henry Roman, president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, after public bargaining with Denver Public Schools ended.
Meanwhile, DPS Superintendent Susana Cordova told FOX31 she was also disappointed the union did not counter the district's offer.
"I think it‚Äôs really unfortunate where we are where we are right now," Cordova said. "The district put forth one proposal and got nothing in return. That's not negotiating. That‚Äôs not negotiating in good faith."

The fire began Thursday at an Arctic shipyard where the submarine Yekaterinburg was in drydock. At midday Friday, Russian state television showed the rubber-coated hull of the submarine still smoldering, with firefighters gathering around it and some standing on top to douse it with water.
An unspecified number of crew have remained inside the submarine, Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement.

On Monday, Jan. 21 he released an open letter on the team‚Äôs Facebook page, along with two video clips, calling into question not only the suspensions themselves, but how the matter was subsequently handled by both the West Coast Senior Hockey League (WCSHL) and Hockey NL (HNL).
While the Jets were handed a total of five games for fighting, the Mariners were deemed the instigating team and received stiffer suspensions.
‚ÄúThe Mariners organization is very disappointed with how this incident was handled and feel that they were unjustly penalized. Thirteen games from one incident with one team is the longest suspension in league history,‚Äù wrote Battiste.

In a new paper featured on the July 30 cover of Nature, scientists from the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University, the University of Rochester, University of California at Berkeley, and Washington University in St. Louis have shown that it is possible to track these quantum trajectories and compare them to a recently developed theory for predicting the most likely path a system will take between two states.

"She's acting as a lookout and she actually directs them and you can see her give a hand motion to them to start walking and leaving the store," Dolan explained.

HAMPTON, N.H., Jan. 17, 2019 -- To help beat those Monday blues, Planet Fitness, Inc., one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the U.S., today announced it will open its doors across 1,600+ locations in the U.S. for free workouts on "Blue Monday" (Jan. 21, 2019) to anyone 18 years and older (with valid photo ID).
"Blue Monday," which falls on the third Monday in January, is known as one of the most depressing days of the year. Originated in 2005, the day was determined to be "blue" due to a combination of factors, including weather conditions, lack of motivation, debt level, and the time since the December and New Year holidays. According to a study* published in the American Psychological Association, just a few minutes of exercise can help lift any spirits and within five minutes after moderate exercise, individuals receive a positive mood-enhancement effect. A study** out of the University of Michigan also found that as little as 10 minutes of physical activity per week or one day of exercise per week might result in increased levels of happiness. Additionally, research shows the effects of physical activity extend beyond the short-term, as exercise helps alleviate long-term depression.
"At Planet Fitness, we recognize and celebrate the many benefits of regular physical activity on our members' health both physically and mentally," said Brian Zehetner, Director of Health and Fitness for Planet Fitness. "We are committed to making a difference in people's lives and we're here

Researchers who assessed nearly 1,500 older women found those who sat most of the day and got little exercise had cells that were biologically older by eight years than the women's actual age.
"Our study found cells age faster with a sedentary lifestyle. Chronological age doesn't always match biological age," said lead author Aladdin Shadyab. He's from the University of California, San Diego's School of Medicine.
The study doesn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between accelerated aging and lack of exercise.
Still, "discussions about the benefits of exercise should start when we are young, and physical activity should continue to be part of our daily lives as we get older, even at 80 years old," Shadyab said in a university news release.
Telomeres naturally shorten with age, but health and lifestyle factors -- such as smoking and obesity -- can accelerate the process. Shortened telomeres are linked with heart disease, diabetes and cancer, the researchers explained in background notes.
"We found that women who sat longer did not have shorter telomere length if they exercised for at least 30 minutes a day, the national recommended guideline," Shadyab said.

Being stuck at a weight-loss plateau eventually happens to everyone who tries to lose weight. Even so, most people are surprised when it happens to them because they're still eating carefully and exercising regularly. The frustrating reality is that even well-planned weight-loss efforts can stall.
What causes a weight-loss plateau?
During the first few weeks of losing weight, a rapid drop is normal. In part, this is because when you cut calories, the body gets needed energy initially by releasing its stores of glycogen, a type of carbohydrate found in the muscles and liver.
Glycogen is partly made of water, so when glycogen is burned for energy, it releases water, resulting in weight loss that's mostly water. This effect is temporary, however.
As you lose weight, you lose some muscle along with fat. Muscle helps keep the rate at which you burn calories (metabolism) up. So as you lose weight, your metabolism declines, causing you to burn fewer

Originally aimed at school children, but now the Daily Mile Foundation have tweaked it for adults too - more info can be found in the link below. In short, the study found that children taking part in the daily mile, which is fifteen minutes of jogging per day, became faster, increased their moderate to vigorous activity by nine minutes per day and cut their sedentary time by eighteen minutes per day. They became leaner, they learnt to exercise which likely will influence their life long exercise habits. Their bone density in later life will likely increase and their risk of heart disease will likely decline. Their brain development and function will receive a boost, they will feel more awake, have increased attention, better verbal memory and improved overall wellbeing. Sounds pretty positive to me.

First, the things we know: Ash got late and had to pick the reserve Pokemon Pikachu. The other 3 starter Pokemon already got picked, one of which was picked by Gary. At the end of the series, you could see that Gary picked Squirtle.
So the question is, who picked the other 2 starters and where were they mentioned?
Your question really inspired me to find a answer. I found answers on multiple sites.
In the series, Ash and co. encounter a Charmander that was abandoned by its owner. We might infer that the original owner was one of the other two Pallet Town trainers. In addition, the Bulbasaur Ash and co. encounter was raised in the Hidden Village, which the article linked states was a haven for, among other things, abandoned Pokemon. So it appears possible that the other Pallet Town trainers also abandoned his starter Pokemon.

More former Ohio State University wrestlers have come forward to contradict Rep. Jim Jordan‚Äôs claim that he had no idea the wrestling team doctor was molesting athletes.
One of the wrestlers, Shawn Dailey, said he was groped half a dozen times by Dr. Richard Strauss in the mid-1990s, when Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach. Dailey said he was too embarrassed to report the abuse directly to Jordan at the time, but he said Jordan took part in conversations where Strauss' abuse of many other team members came up.
Dailey spoke out two days after NBC News reported that three former wrestlers who were coached by Jordan more than two decades ago accused the GOP congressman of turning a blind eye to Strauss' alleged abuse and then lying about it. Jordan denied knowing anything about the abuse and continues to do so.

Inside, they find a shop where a Pok√©mon Connoisseur is checking the compatibility between Trainers and Pok√©mon. Ash lines up to be evaluated as well, but just as he‚Äôs getting impatient with the wait, another shopkeeper invites him over. The proprietor is a girl named Burgundy, who insists that she‚Äôs a Connoisseur, too. But Ash gets suspicious when Burgundy says he should get rid of all his Pok√©mon because he isn‚Äôt compatible with any of them‚Äîeven his best buddy Pikachu!
We then discover that she went up against Cilan at the Striaton Gym‚Äîand since her defeat there, she‚Äôs been holding a serious grudge. So, she studied to become a Connoisseur, then returned to challenge Cilan again. But by the time she got back, Cilan was already on his journey with Ash and Iris!
Burgundy challenges Cilan to a revenge battle, saying that if she wins, Ash has to give up all of his Pok√©mon. Ash is very worried, but Cilan accepts anyway, and in the process of defeating Burgundy, gently attempts to teach her the value of open-mindedness when evaluating Pok√©mon and Trainer compatibility. Angrily, she vows to come back again to beat Cilan, then stomps away. Ash is just happy that he can keep all his Pok√©mon, and they can again set their sights on the Castelia City Gym!

In the quiet intervals when I switched the chain saw off, I could hear great-spotted woodpeckers drumming on trees not too far off, and a robin hopped amongst the leaf litter I was disturbing, no doubt taking advantage of insects scurrying about. There were plenty of fallow and roe deer marks in the soft earth round the ash tree, and most of the thin and whippy branches now at ground level had been eaten.

‚ÄúThis historic project will make U.S. Highway 101 much safer, reduce traffic congestion and improve access to local businesses,‚Äù said Caltrans Director Malcolm Dougherty.
The Prunedale Improvement Project upgraded a 13-mile segment of U.S. Highway 101 from Russell/Espinoza Road to just north of Echo Valley Road.
Prior to construction, this section of U.S. Highway 101 was a four-lane expressway with several at-grade intersections. The combination of high-speed traffic on the highway conflicting with vehicles trying to enter, exit and make left turns caused congestion and impacted safety.
To make the highway safer, a new concrete median barrier was installed at various locations throughout the project limits, permanently removing left turns across U.S. Highway 101.

Moslems note that the name Jesse is a contraction of the name Ishmael. On the basis of this they claim that the prophecy is of a descendent of Ishmael and not of Jesse. The prophecy tells us that he will be a success as a statesman and a leader of men. This, they assert, could only be Muhammad. This claim is further supported by asking the question why Jesus would be referred to as a son of the relatively obscure Jesse when he could have been described as a Son of David.
The origin of the name Jesse may be a contraction of Ishmael, but Jesse and Ishmael are distinct and different people. Ishmael the son of Hagar is never called Jesse and Jesse the father of David is never called Ishmael. Thus the prophecy is of someone descended from Jesse the father of David.

The story went that in the 1970s, Alejandro was involved with the leftist guerrilla rebels fighting the country‚Äôs authoritarian regime, a regime that eventually killed him for his activism. After killing Alejandro, government soldiers visited the Mendoza household and told the family to not investigate Alejandro‚Äôs death unless they wanted to suffer the same fate. And so the family kept their mouths shut, even amongst themselves. These broad strokes of a story were all Jesse ever heard of his uncle‚Äôs death.
But a couple of years ago on a visit to Guatemala, Jesse encountered a very different story of how Alejandro died. In this story, Alejandro was a brawler. And one night at a bar in a small town, he got into a fight over a woman with the son of the local mayor. The mayor‚Äôs son called in help, and Alejandro was stabbed to death in the bar.
So Jesse set out to find the truth. Was his uncle‚Äôs death a crime of passion or a crime of politics? After interviewing several members of his family, another bigger story emerged. One in which fear resonates down through generations and memory is as much a casualty as flesh.

Bailey, a sophomore running back at Aurora University and Oswego East graduate, lost his friend Lawrence Joshua earlier this year. A cousin, Darren Iverner, also passed away.
Both were on his mind Saturday.
"They are definitely part of my 'Why,'" Bailey said. "I was thinking about them all week. I wanted to dedicate my game to them."
He did, in spectacular fashion.
Bailey set an AU single-game rushing record with 295 yards in the Spartans' 41-24 win over Benedictine.
"I was definitely ready," Bailey said. "I prepared myself mentally for this game."
Bailey also gave credit where credit was due.
Bailey scored three touchdowns, breaking off 56 and 53-yard touchdowns in the second half.
"I have to give credit to the O-line, all the glory," Bailey said. "My biggest runs, I didn't even get touched. They made it happen. The coaches prepared us mentally and physically. And then of course our scout defense, they prepare us every day."
Bailey started at running back as a junior at Oswego East, but moved to defensive back and was a backup on offense when Ivory-Kelly Martin transferred to East in 2016.
AU coach Rick Ponx jumped at the opportunity to bring in a talented local player. Bailey tore the meniscus in his right knee the summer before

It started on Sunday with a visit to the ER and then she seemed better on Monday. We think it is because they hydrated her with fluids under the skin plus an injection for the vomiting. Anyway on Tuesday she wasn't acting as well as on Monday and she would only eat a few bites of chicken in the morning and then that was it. Wednesday she was eating even less and drinking less, but acted okay. Well, her urine was getting darker and darker since she was going on a pee pad I could see the color. By Thursday morning it was brown so off to the vet we went. Her liver numbers were sky high plus she tested positive for pancreatitis. She has always had a sensitive tummy and we are pretty sure this time it all started with a certain someone, not me, giving her some of his leftover sausage on Saturday. No more rich sausage or anything else for this girl. I don't care how much she bats those brown eyes at him. She spent the night in the hospital as they flushed her with fluids and medications to get her back to normal.
She is on the mend and should come home today! I'm going to give her some extra hugs this weekend, but not any treats she shouldn't have.

Purple Panda Nursery, on Norbury Crescent, was criticised by Ofsted in November 2016 and given the second-lowest possible rating of "requires improvement".
This was after inspectors found that staffing arrangements were "not always secure" and that staff supervision was "not regular enough".
But the education watchdog has now heaped praise on the nursery, which caters for up to 60 children between five months and five years old, after an inspection on October 31.
The latest report, published in November, praised head teacher and director Anthony Bailey for making "great progress" by "evaluating his setting well" and "regularly" monitoring staff at the nursery.
Mr Bailey explained that since the 2016 report, he had "worked hard to make learning fun", including putting on a science lesson where pre-school children could watch an octopus being dissected.
The former lawyer, who gave up his role in law to open the nursery in 2014, said: "The children have a lot of science and cookery lessons, which are great because they involve multiple skills like communication, maths and measurements.
"In one of our recent science lessons at the pre-school, we had an octopus brought in and children were given the chance to watch it being dissected.
"It was a fascinating lesson which involved several skills including biology and communication."
The octopus, Mr Bailey explained, was dead when it was brought in and while children were encouraged to watch as staff completed the process, it

Digital Spy recently caught up with Calen Mackenzie, who plays Bailey, to hear his thoughts on the issue-based storyline and the other dramas ahead for his character.
How did you feel about taking on such a serious storyline?
"I was thrilled. Previously I'd done the Gem storyline which was also quite serious, so to get the chance to do another storyline that is quite deep, dark and emotional was great.
"It's an unexpected storyline because it's completely out of character for Bailey, but when people are pushed, these things can happen.

How did you prepare for the story?
"I did my research by speaking to my friends, because some of them have been through issues like this when it comes to drinking and spiralling out of control. It can happen just as much to people that you wouldn't expect it to happen to.

However, Dodgers general manager Andrew Friedman said Bailey has been released "as a condition of waiving his 10-and-5 rights," per Eric Stephen of SB Nation.
Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic was the first to report on the expected Bailey release.
Bailey, who went 1-14 with a 6.09 ERA last year, has had an up-and-down MLB career that is at its lowest point.
He was taken seventh overall in the 2004 MLB draft and got the call to the bigs just three seasons later. However, Bailey had just a 4.89 ERA in 78 starts from 2007 through 2011, which included numerous stops back in the minors. He had a control issue as exemplified by a 13.7 percent walk rate in 2007 and 10.5 mark in 2009, per FanGraphs.
However, Bailey found a groove in 2012 and started a three-season stretch in which he went 33-27 with a 3.61 ERA and struck out 7.9 batters per nine innings. His walk rate plummeted, with a low of 6.0 percent in 2012.
Bailey had turned the corner entering his 2015 season, and he signed a six-year, $105 million contract to stay in Cincinnati.
Unfortunately, he underwent Tommy John surgery, which limited him to just eight starts in 2015 and 2016. In the coming years, Bailey also had surgery to remove bone spurs

"Thank you for sending a note home for the second day in a row to say my daughter was dressed inappropriately for school," Pearlman wrote in the letter, published in Today. "I&apos;d like to offer an additional thank you for forcing her to change into large mesh shorts that have been worn by only God knows who and potentially never washed.

Members of the U.S. Senate saw the story -- and now they want more money and manpower for the federal agents tasked with stopping the thefts.
In a formal request late Thursday, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania requested millions more dollars in funding for federal auditors. He's asking the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to restore funding for auditors to 2013 levels, before budget cuts.
At least 35 cases of gas theft this year have cost taxpayers more than $300,000 in 2015, according to public records obtained by the I-Team.
Casey said increased funding is needed for agents who investigate, saying auditors save more money than they cost, by stopping waste and theft.
The request comes after a recent News4 I-Team investigation that showed hundreds of thousands of dollars in gasoline thefts, some of which were caught on video by surveillance cameras. Some of them were swiping their government credit cards and buying gasoline for their personal cars.
"When that is abused, it undermines the whole system," Casey said. "It gives credence to the arguments that people make about government. The worst beliefs that people have about government are fortified by that type of finding, but it was a great investigation, and we need more of that."

The investigators who scoured the Orange County woods where Caylee's remains were found last month found a loose sticker similar in size.

The new detail was one of several made public in hundreds of pages of legal documents released by the State Attorney's Office in its case against Caylee's mother, Casey Anthony.
Investigators determined that 2-year-old Caylee's remains appeared to have been packed originally inside a black plastic bag and a cloth laundry hamper bag.
Also found were a size 3T shirt, a small pair of striped white shorts, small cloth-type letters that appear to be iron-ons and a Winnie the Pooh blanket.
In one search warrant, investigators asked to collect a variety of items from the nearby Anthony family home on Hopespring Drive, including arts--and-crafts items, stickers and scrapbooking material.
The search warrant also sought all of Casey Anthony's shoes, small plastic toy horses similar to one found at the crime scene, and permission to take note of any prescriptions on the property.
Many of the documents released Wednesday were reports from crime-scene technicians on the evidence they've collected, ranging from clothes to hair.

Giving the public greater access to weapons has been one of Bolsonaro's flagship issues, and he had promised to take a hard line against criminality in a country where last year there were 63,880 known murders, an average of 175 per day.
"Given that the people made a sovereign decision in the 2005 referendum, to guarantee themselves that legitimate right to self-defense, I, as president, am going to use this weapon," said Bolsonaro, displaying the pen with which he then signed the decree.
"The people decided to buy weapons and ammunition and we cannot deny what the people wanted at that time," the president added at the signing ceremony, at which some of his Cabinet ministers, including Justice and Public Safety Minister Sergio Moro, were present.
At his inauguration on Jan. 1, Bolsonaro reiterated his desire to facilitate gun ownership for "good citizens" so that they can defend themselves and fight crime in one of the world's most violent countries.
The measure, Bolsonaro said, seeks to allow "good citizens to be able to have peace within their homes."
According to a survey published by the Datafolha institute late last year, the percentage of Brazilians who feel that owning guns must be "prohibited since it represents a threat to the lives of other people" increased from 55 percent in October, when Bolsonaro was elected president with a 55 percent majority, to 61 percent in December.

Former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva was suspended for one year and fined following a hearing with the Nevada State Athletic Commission on Thursday after testing positive for banned substances surrounding his Jan. 31 fight against Nick Diaz.
Silva was also fined and the result of his fight against Diaz was overturned to a no contest.
The two-hour-plus hearing saw Silva and his attorney make their defense while claiming that the fighter took a tainted sexual-enhancement drug, which then caused a positive test result.
Silva tested positive for Drostanolone and Androstane ‚Äî both classified as banned, performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) ‚Äî following a test administered on Jan. 9. Silva also tested positive for Drostanolone again in a post-fight test on Jan. 31 as well as two more drugs ‚Äî temazepam and oxazepam ‚Äî that are used for anti-anxiety and sleeplessness.
During the hearing, Silva testified and claimed that the tainted supplement was a sexual-enhancement liquid given to him by a friend who purchased the drug in Thailand. Silva stated that the off-market drug similar to Viagra or Cialis was not available for purchase in the United States or Brazil. According to Silva, he knew Marcos Fernandes for approximately one year through training together in Brazil and during a conversation talking about "man stuff," Silva says he received the supplement.
Silva said he took the sexual-enhancement drug for about three months prior to the fight.
Silva and his defense team called upon Paul Scott, who previously worked with the UCLA laboratory and also testified in cases

Mr Lee served as Singapore‚Äôs Prime Minister for 31 years from 1959 to 1990, later becoming Senior Minister and Minister Mentor. During this period, Imperial and Singapore forged a wide range of education and research ties and in 2002 the College recognised Mr Lee‚Äôs extraordinary achievements with the award of the Fellowship of Imperial College at a graduation ceremony on its annual Commemoration Day.
On the eve of the ceremony, Mr Lee took the chance to reminisce about his first visit to London as a student in 1946, sharing some of his characteristically forthright views on Britain and the world at a special dinner for over 600 Imperial alumni, staff, students and friends held in the Natural History Museum‚Äôs Dinosaur Hall.
In 1965, when Singapore achieved independence, 19 Singaporean students attended Imperial. Today the College educates 400 Singaporean students, has a 2,000-strong alumni community, and Imperial researchers publish hundreds of joint papers with partners in Singapore.
The College‚Äôs ever growing ties with Singapore culminated in the establishment of the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), a joint medical school between Imperial and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which welcomed its first students in 2013.

Created by cartoonist John Hambrock and syndicated by King Features, The Brilliant Mind of Edison Lee launches in newspapers worldwide on Nov. 12, 2006.
The Brilliant Mind of Edison Lee centers on Edison Lee, an atypical 10-year-old boy genius, who along with his parents, grandfather and talking lab rat, comment on current political, economic and social concerns facing Americans today. The inquisitive, young Edison likes to take various, ordinary topics and add his own unique perspectives to them, often using zany, elaborate inventions to help illustrate his thoughts.
‚Ä¢	Don Lee, Edison‚Äôs father, is extremely proud of his son‚Äôs unusual gifts. He works hard to instill in Edison his same hardworking, middle-class American values.
‚Ä¢	Carol Lee, an educator, is Edison‚Äôs mother. She is the politically correct member of the family and the juggler of the family‚Äôs day-to-day needs.
‚Ä¢	Orville Lee, Edison‚Äôs paternal grandfather, spends his day fussing over his medications and complaining about his latest doctor‚Äôs visit.
‚Ä¢	Joules is Edison‚Äôs delightfully naive laboratory assistant. His only knowledge of the outside world is filtered through Edison‚Äôs sociopolitical perspective.
‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs artwork is clearly very good, but upon further examination, it is his writing that makes him stand out. He has the ability to write social and political commentary in a disarming way, and neatly package it with the right amount of

"Lee's application to visit her husband was again recently rejected by prison authorities without an explanation," SEF spokeswoman Kuan An-lu (ÁÆ°ÂÆâÈú≤) said.
Kuan suggested that the prison may have turned down Lee's request to visit her husband earlier this month because of the heavy traffic expected in China ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday.
But she urged the Chinese side to fully protect the rights of the imprisoned person and his family and said the SEF will continue to help his family members relay their concerns to Chishan Prison.
Lee was repeatedly denied visits to her imprisoned husband starting in September 2018 until December, when she was eventually allowed to see him in Chishan Prison.
Lee said at the time that her husband was in poor health and being treated inhumanely in the prison, and that he was unable to buy the food and clothes he needed to withstand the prison's conditions because his bank account was frozen.
Sources indicated, however, that Lee Ming-che's bank account was unfrozen recently, enabling him to purchase additional food and clothes.

After starting the year with a 0-6 record in League VI play, the Bonackers knew they couldn‚Äôt afford to lose a single game to the traditionally weak Warriors if they wanted to keep any hope alive of finishing with an even record and making a return to the Class A postseason.
East Hampton took care of business, getting the sweep last week to improve to 3-6 in the league, 4-7 overall, and head coach Ed Bahns said he was pleased to see his players improve upon what has been poor defense and fielding.
The Bonackers have been hitting well throughout the season and continued that in the first game against Amityville, taking a 17-9 win on the road on April 14. Two days later, senior pitcher Liam Lee had what Bahns said was his best performance in two years, going the distance in a 9-0 win. Lee allowed five hits and had six strikeouts and did not issue any walks in the seven-inning effort.
East Hampton also had just one error, which Bahns also said was good to see. The Bonackers shot themselves in the foot numerous times in their earlier losses with miscues in the field.

A cell phone line was set up courtesy of Cingular for the days of Dec. 5-9. Calls were actually taken for 13 days, several days before and after the specified days.
Taking most of the phone calls was Ada DeZerga. DeZerga asked the caller for basic information such as name, address and if the caller was the child‚Äôs parent, and were they residents of Carson City, Douglas or Lyon counties.
If the caller does not receive assistance, they must explain how they qualify.
‚ÄúWe had five callers who made too much money,‚Äù DeZerga said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for them to understand the program is for low-income. They felt they were justified to receive toys because of the cost of living.
‚ÄúThey said that after they paid their bills, they couldn‚Äôt afford toys. One woman was way off the charts.
DeZerga said she‚Äôs helped with the program two years now and has worked with nonprofits more than 20 years. She will volunteer again.
‚ÄúI was disappointed I would miss the actual distribution,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI would have liked to see the families I helped.
The Wybles said there were only a few who tried to ‚Äúdouble-dip‚Äù from their program and others.

Years later, Dr. Carson would learn that his mom was illiterate. She never actually could read any of his summaries. Intuitively, Mrs. Carson knew that if she could instill in her son the daily habit of reading it would help get him out of the ghetto and realize the American Dream. And it worked!

Straitlaced Museum Curator Ian Jones (Clunes) is about to marry his boss's daughter, Fiona (Caroline Harker). Preparations are underway and Fiona is already drawing up seating plans. So when a repatriation claim comes into the museum for a Maori carving to be returned to a remote corner of New Zealand, Ian isn't keen to be given the job, particularly when he understands what a delicate case it is. The Ministry has told the museum to be sympathetic to the claim, and while the museum director has agreed to do this, he has no intention of letting the piece go back.

With a new introduction by Helen MacDonald, A Rage for Falcons not only shares the history of falconry, but shows how and why falconry has lasted.

Of course there are a number of traditions implying that his holiness had expressed his humbleness and meekness to Mansur! Without any doubt none of these traditions are correct. I have conducted research on these traditions and come to the conclusion that none of them are authentic.
These traditions are often traced back to Rabi‚Äô Hajeb who is definitely a corrupt figure and a close ally of Mansur. Ironically, some people have said that Rabi‚Äô was a Shiite and a lover of the Ahl-ul-Bayt (the Progeny of the Holy Prophet)!
How can Rabi‚Äô be a Shiite? Rabi‚Äô was a servant, subservient, and a bondman of Mansur. He is one who had entered the Abbasside system in his childhood, served them and had become the confidante of Mansur. He had served them a lot and attained the rank of minister in the Abbasside system.
Had not it been for Rabi‚Äôs efforts, the Caliphate would not have remained in Mansur‚Äôs family after his death and most probably his uncles would have inherited it. Rabi‚Äô, who was the only person on Mansur‚Äôs bedside at the time of his death, counterfeited a will and testament for him in which Mansur‚Äôs son Mahdi was named as his successor.

The wood is also favorable for furniture and flooring. Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high perishability in contact with ground soil. It is also used to make lobster traps. Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid electric guitar bodies. It makes a very servicable longbow if properly worked. The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then. It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries.
The tree has a mast crop every 11 years and is very easy to plant and cultivate with a survival rate of 30%.

One such instance took place in Castlemont, Texas, with Tammi Bleimeyer and her 5-year-old stepson Jordan.
On Monday, Bleimeyer was sentenced to 28 years in prison for starving the little boy and forcing him to sleep in a locked crawl space under the stairs, which prosecutors in the case compared to the closet in which the fictional Harry Potter was forced to live by his aunt and uncle. As AOL reported, doctors who examined the boy after he was rescued compared his condition to that of a Holocaust survivor.
The 37-year-old mother of seven was found guilty of injury to a child by omission for her actions against her stepson. The crawl space under the stairs was littered with loose nails and exposed wires.
Bleimeyer‚Äôs 16-year-old son was the one who reported her to the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable‚Äôs Office in March 2014 for the abuse. He called the police on his mother after an incident in which she slammed Jordan‚Äôs head against a wall and shocked him with a taser.

So, you know I needed some great shoes that were going to get me through security with no hassles, but were also comfortable. The Ash FX from Superfeet were the perfect choice for this trip.
The Ash FX is a cute shoe that‚Äôs a perfect cross between a sneaker and a bootie. It‚Äôs more booth than athletic shoe, but still has some serious high-top inspiration. And the Wild Dove color is a great shade for spring. They‚Äôre a very light grey shade and oh so pretty. They‚Äôre neutral enough to go with just about anything you want to wear.
Now, I‚Äôve told you about Superfeet and how comfortable their shoes are a couple times. The Olympia Boots are in regular rotation In my wardrobe, and they have a pair of loafers that I am living in! So I was pretty sure that these booties weren‚Äôt gonna let me down.
Superfeet takes a scientific approach to designing their shoes. They start with using research paired with a specially designed 3D printing process to perfect their insoles. Their insoles are ergonomically designed to cradle your feet, and recreate the walking motion. This, in turn, helps relieve a lot of the fatigue that you may experience. It also helps lead to that feeling that your shoes are already broken in.

The thousands of other drivers working for Addison Lee are not automatically entitled to compensation. However, given the body of recent case law, there is a chance that further successful claims may follow and Addison Lee practices will have to change.

Thomas Addison was born in April 1793 at Long Benton near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His father, Joseph Addison, was a grocer and flour dealer. Thomas studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and took his doctorate in medicine in 1815. He then held various posts in London hospitals, and in 1819 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London. Although now a fully qualified physician, he entered as a student at Guy's Hospital about 1820. In 1824 he was appointed assistant physician to that hospital and in 1837 full physician. An acute clinical observer and a brilliant teacher, he did much to create the fame of the medical school at Guy's.
Addison's medical writings were not numerous but very important. In 1829, in collaboration with John Morgan, he published the first work on toxicology in English. Much of his work‚Äîincluding his important observations on pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and fatty liver‚Äîappeared in the Guy's Hospital Reports. He gave the first description of appendicitis in his and Richard Bright's The Elements of the Practice of Medicine (vol. 1, 1839), most of which was written by Addison.

There was, as part of the agreement, a portable computer which each driver had to log into. Once they did, work was allocated automatically to them via the computer and they had to provide reasons if a job was refused. If they did not, they were subject to sanctions. The contractual documents described them as independent contractors. Mr Lange and his colleagues, supported by their union, claimed that they were in fact workers and therefore entitled to rights such as the National Minimum Wage and statutory holiday pay.
A tribunal agreed with them. Addison Lee appealed the tribunal's findings that each was a worker, arguing that the tribunal had wrongly disapplied parts of the agreement in finding there was an obligation to do some work.
One of the main issues raised in the appeal was whether the tribunal was right to hold that the drivers were contractually obliged to do at least some driving work for the company, notwithstanding that the written terms they had signed up to stipulated drivers were under no such obligation. The EAT upheld the tribunal‚Äôs decision that this aspect of the agreement was irrelevant because it didn‚Äôt reflect the reality of what had been agreed.

Read as Jordan shares his own inspirational testimony.
I accepted Jesus in May 2008. It was my second time through the Alpha program at North View, and almost a full year after I started regularly attending church. Now, I had been a firm atheist through that year and the few that preceded it. The reason I was in church at all, as you can probably guess, was a girl.
Of course, by the end of a year, it wasn't just a girl. I had many Christian friends. Somehow I had been taken in by a group of Christians and they really became my social circle. It's almost overwhelming looking back on how radically God interfered in my life. I was pulled out of a life of hopelessness and dropped into a place where the Kingdom surrounded me.
My friends were extremely patient with me. I was good at being an atheist. There was no argument for faith that I would have shied away from, and I never lost a debate. I knew all the talking points; from philosophy to biology, and I was dead certain of everything I believed.

Few players in basketball history have possessed the natural ability to score like Michael Jordan. In fact, Jordan retired as the league's all-time points-per-game leader, edging out Wilt Chamberlain with an average of 30.1.
Most of Jordan's best scoring performance took place early in his career, when the championship era Bulls had not yet taken shape and the team relied a little more on his knack for getting buckets. Today marks the anniversary of two of his most memorable outings.
On March 28, 1990, Jordan rung up the rival Cleveland Cavaliers for a career-high 69 points at Richfield Coliseum. The Bulls needed every one of those points, as they edged out the Cavs 117-113 in overtime. After the game, a young Jordan said, "This would have to be my greatest game. When I scored 63 against Boston, we lost. It sure feels a lot better."

In 2017, Ochsner health system sent a letter to some patients after federal investigators contacted the hospital. The hospital warned the patients their personal information may have been compromised by a former Ochsner employee in the billing department.
Ochsner has not named that employee, but an alleged victim in this case told Fox 8 she learned the identity of the suspect after receiving notification from both the IRS and the Department of Justice on the progress of the case.
Fox 8 found federal court documents out of Texas matching the names of two co-defendants the alleged victim was given: Maegan Jordan and Demetrice Hodges.
Documents outline how Jordan, through her employment, took peoples' names, social security numbers and dates of birth sometime from 2011 through 2014.
Investigators said Jordan then sold that information to Hodges, and Hodges then used the information to file false tax returns and had the money deposited into an account.
Jordan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in federal court in August 2017. The next day, investigators indicted Hodges with aggravated identity theft and other federal charges. Hodges pleaded guilty in May of this year. As of Wednesday (Nov. 7), Hodges has yet to be sentenced.

For those who face ethnic and class disadvantages, including Cambodian-, Laotian-, and Hmong-Americans, affirmative action policies will help. It will also help high-achieving groups like Chinese-, Indian-, and Korean-Americans to experience racial and ethnic diversity and better prepare them to work in diverse workplaces."
Lee and Zhou's book was cited in an October op-ed by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof that some Asian Americans criticized for promoting a new version of the ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù idea. Lee, who doesn‚Äôt buy into that stereotype, wrote a rebuttal for CNN in response to Kristof's column.
Whether affirmative action survives another test at the Supreme Court, schools are recognizing on their own the importance of more traditional capital in diversity efforts. In November, Yale and Brown both made commitments to diversity on their campuses. Yale said it will devote $50 million to retaining and recruiting a diverse faculty, and Brown said it would spend $100 million.
Correction: An earlier version of this article suggested that 69 percent of all Asian Americans supported affirmative action. The National Asian American Survey data cited by Jennifer Lee refers specifically to registered California voters.

But Goldman Sachs has found a way to streamline IPOs ‚Äî one of its most lucrative businesses ‚Äî by automating some of the most repetitive and labor-intensive tasks.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, roughly half of the steps that Goldman Sachs investments bankers go through during an IPO have been automated, eliminating thousands of human work hours.
The program, called Deal Link, is used to deal with legal and compliance reviews, fill in forms and generate reports. It was started by George Lee, the chief information officer for Goldman Sachs's investment-banking division.
"In the beginning, Lee and his team took aim at the most obvious steps for disruption: the routine phone calls, emails and tasks that young bankers plow through at the beginning of every IPO. That included phoning the compliance department to look for potential conflicts, contacting legal to assign lawyers and compiling an organizational book for meetings.
Now that's all done with the click of a mouse in the new application, which features a step-by-step guide replacing ad hoc training materials and word-of-mouth advice."
Even with all the tasks that the program has eliminated for human bankers, the firm's hiring has been unaffected. Instead, the program has freed up bankers to talk more with clients and reduced the workload for junior bankers so they can work on more satisfying tasks.

Students learn on a Blast, a smaller bike put out by Harley subsidiary Buell Motorcycle Co. The class focus is on learning to ride safely, but it also includes tips on servicing and buying gear.
The program appears to be working. Although 92 percent of Harleys are bought by men, with an average age of 45, Rider's Edge classes are 42 percent women with a third of all participants between the ages of 18 and 34.
"It provides that entry point for [beginners] who might feel uncomfortable entering a dealership," says Lara Lee, who helped develop and launch Rider's Edge and served as its first director, a position she left in February.

The research spans human and aquatic toxicology, emission studies, life cycle assessments but also includes research on textile processing and textile analysis and testing. The SUPFES project also integrates dissemination of knowledge to industry and public bodies to maximize the use of the results created in the project. The SUPFES project will test the hypotheses that emissions of these chemicals are mostly generated as diffuse emissions, i.e. as small and large emissions throughout the whole life of the product, and that textiles are an important source of these emissions.
The additional goal for SUPFES is to better understand performance and environmental impact from alternatives to replace fluorinated chemicals which are harmful to the environment. Within the project a number of scientific and industrial partners collaborate to assess and explore if diffuse sources, with textiles as case studies, are a major contributor to the persistent flouorochemical pollution.

However, it is alleged that Michael Allen Meakin got into his van after leaving the Plumpton Hotel in Sydney&apos;s west and pursued Nicholas McEvoy, 30, who was on foot, and intentionally ran him over.
Mr McEvoy&apos;s body was found by the side of Richmond Road, Dean Park, in the early hours of February 21, 2014.
Meakin&apos;s defence barrister Grant Brady SC has told the trial Mr McEvoy&apos;s death was simply a tragic accident.
At the Sydney Supreme Court on Tuesday, Plumpton Hotel bouncer Brendan "Tiny" Wetere said he thought the conflict was finished once both men left the premises.
The argument between the two started during a game of pool between Meakin and a pub regular, Matthew "Chicken" Henshaw.
The court heard Mr McEvoy was barracking for Mr Henshaw as he played, which annoyed Meakin.
Mr Henshaw said Meakin eventually told Mr McEvoy to "piss off".
The court heard the exchange between Meakin and Mr McEvoy escalated and Mr Wetere asked both to leave.
CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Wetere coaxing Mr McEvoy out of the pub car park until he is out of sight.
Meakin then gets into his van and leaves.
"It is all over at this stage, isn&apos;t it?" Mr Brady asked Mr Wetere.
A regular drinker at the Plumpton Hotel, Kevin Loveridge, said the tiff between the two men was "nothing major" and that he tried to diffuse the situation by telling Mr McEvoy to "just

Arguably one of the most challenging ‚Äî and currently unsolved ‚Äî problems in marine imaging is the robust, consistent, and accurate reconstruction of lost colours and contrast in underwater photographs.
While large image datasets taken on land can be analysed with a plethora of computer-vision and machine-learning algorithms that can segment, recognise, count, and classify objects, underwater datasets do not benefit from the full power of these methods because water degrades images too severely for automated analysis.
Existing methods that try to recover lost colours perform inconsistently. According to researchers at the University of Haifa this is because these methods rely on an equation that inaccurately represents how light travels in water. They have proposed a revised equation that corrects these inaccuracies, and they are now developing a method to efficiently remove the effects of water from underwater photographs.
They study coral reefs in Eilat, in the northernmost tip of the Red Sea. For every dataset they collect, they must also measure or estimate attenuation coefficients corresponding to water conditions on that day, and they use these coefficients to remove the degrading effects of water from images. These coefficients can be measured in the water using specialised instruments, but this is costly and impractical, so they have turned to freely-available satellite imagery for the estimation of the optical parameters they need (Figure 1, top

Mr B had various x-rays, scans and unsuccessful pleural drainage procedures at hospital. He also had a painful TALC pleurodesis procedure with a biopsy, which sadly confirmed that he had mesothelioma. Following his diagnosis, Mr B did not think that he would be able to claim compensation because the employer that exposed him to asbestos, Thomas Edwards, was a sole trader.

The accident occurred during a weekday evening‚Äôs prime commuting hours. According to police, the accident involved a car that had stopped in the median near Exit 2, apparently because it was having mechanical troubles. That car was rear-ended by another car coming down the turnpike. A third vehicle might also have been involved in the crash, but police have not come to any conclusions yet.
Both drivers involved in the rear-end crash managed to walk away from the scene, though the full extent of their injuries is still unknown. Immediately after the accident, several other drivers stopped to help, which slowed traffic on the turnpike and made the accident scene look as if it involved many more drivers than just the two who actually crashed, according to the Nashua Telegraph.

Dr. Feinstein is a Professor at the Department of Internal Medicine, Rush Medical College.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) offers a new, safe, radiation-free modality to help problem-solve diagnostic questions in a wide range of clinical applications, according to an article published by researchers from the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at University of California San Francisco.
Ultrasound contrast agents have been in use throughout most of the world and have been used off-label in the United State for over a decade. In addition to the use of ultrasound contrast agents in cardiac imaging, the FDA recently approved their use in liver imaging for both paediatric and adult patients, and for use in the urinary tract (voiding ultrasonography) in paediatric patients for evaluation of suspected or known vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
The recent FDA approvals are likely to spur wider adoption of CEUS, says the article, which details the modality‚Äôs key advantages. Since the contrast agents are excreted by the lungs they are safe in patients with renal and/or liver dysfunction whom otherwise may not be able to undergo a contrast-enhanced evaluation. Also, CEUS provides unique advantages and can improve visualisation of blood flow and tissue vascularity.

The ultimate frontiersman, Kit Carson spent his career on the edge of the American frontier, exploring, taming, and conquering it. Guts and determination turned Carson from an illiterate runaway into a brigadier general. Fortunate to be friends with one of the greatest promoters of the American West, John C.

Christopher "Kit" Carson was born on December 24, 1809, in Madison County, Kentucky, the third son of Lindsay and Rebecca Carson. The family soon moved to Howard County, Missouri, which was considered the frontier at the time. Carson remembered in his autobiography that "for two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring." As a boy, Carson thrived on the frontier, learning to shoot, hunt, and protect himself. A quick learner, Carson seemed to have a bright future.
In 1818, when Carson was just nine years old, his father was killed when a tree branch fell on him.

While 2017 saw a record amount of precipitation, there wasn't as much flooding as in prior years because of the previous dry period, James said.
"The flow was half of what we saw in 1997," he said. "It was not a huge flood event on the Carson. It was between a 20-25 year flood event. We will experience larger floods in the future."
The Carson River is administered by the Alpine Decree, which means the river is fully appropriated. According to James, 95 percent of that use is for agriculture, with floodwaters going to the Stillwater Project near Fallon.
Because there is no storage upstream, Carson Valley relies on snowpack to store water for irrigation.
James compared flows on the East Fork from 1941 through 1974 with those across 1975 to 2009, and found that flows have increased in March, April and May, but have decreased

Let‚Äôs get to the website, prairieales.com, and see what they have to say about this particular brew.
Sounds like my kind of beer!!!!
This beer came in a 25.4 oz. bottle and it had an ABV of 6.5% according to the label.
It poured a hazy, yellow/golden/orange color. A well sized, fizzy white head was formed from an easy pour. It dissipated rather quickly and little to no lacing was left on the sides of the tulip. I saw quite a bit of sediment floating about the liquid as well.
The nose smelled of soured lemon and grapes with some excellent musty funk involved. Bready and yeasty tones along with some grassy and floral tones as well. This thing was very well balanced and harmonized. I liked the aroma for sure.
The taste also had a good deal of lemon citrus and soured grapes. Very white wine like. A slight acidity was present, but definitely not enough to distract. Some grassy tones and a bit of yeastiness actually helped pull it back a tad.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Crisp, bitey, sharp and dry. The carbonation was fairly lively and a very nice

In other circles, wokeness is something to be performed for an audience so that they might understand just how down with the cause(s) you are.
But in the case of two small, independent brewing companies, "staying woke" isn't either of these things. It's a flavor of beer you should want to drink.
Both The Veil Brewing Co., located in Richmond, Virginia, and Antagonist Ales, a NYC-based microbrewery, have produced small batches of craft IPAs dubbed "Stay Woke" that seemingly have nothing to do with social consciousness and everything to do with ham-handedly co-opting a phrase the companies thought sounded cool.
While Veil makes a point of noting its beer's dank, intense, hoppiness, Antagonist Ales takes things a step further by explaining that the decision on the beer's name was inspired by the "death" of the brewery's first attempt at making booze.
"Our first beer came up dead. [We] needed an awakening," Antagonist Ales' description of their Stay Woke version reads. "Bursting with Citra hops, Stay Woke claws its way up from six feet deep to provide a pale ale hell-bent on enjoyable consumption."
Given the fact that many people have used the phrase "stay woke" as a warning to others in the aftermath of brutal, racially-charged police shootings that have left black and brown people dead, one wonders whether the people at Antagonist Ales fully understood the gravity of the name that they'd chosen.

The crisp, hoppy beer was a blast of flavor the country didn't know it needed. It has become somewhat of the godfather of the brew ever since.
If you want a hoppy beer, a pale ale is like a punch in the teeth. Bitter and aromatic, this style of pale ale is almost truly an American invention, and if you're a fan, you'd put it right up there with baseball, the telephone and Chevrolet. Let's face it: All are of equal importance.
What Are the Characteristics of Pale Ale?
Made with pale malt, a pale ale is distinctly hoppy, more so than other ales or lagers. This high content of pale hops also results in a lighter color and a refreshing taste. However, pale ales, like tastes in most things, varies from North America to Europe. A British pale ale is fruity and malty, while the American pale ale is bitter and aromatic. So, whether you like smelling flowers or eating a plum, there are pale ale varieties for each individual's tastes. Pale ales also allow you a huge range of food options to indulge your inner kid, with burgers, chicken wings and pizza all mixing brilliantly.

Dubbed Airdale Brewing Company, the brewery is founded by Tony Clarke, a former Naval aviator with a passion for home brewing. ‚ÄúI wanted to be a part of the incredible craft beer scene here in San Diego,‚Äù says Clarke who worked as a flight instructor at NAS North Island on Coronado.
So what inspired Clarke to take this career chance? A combination of things factored in, from his desire to work for himself to his passion for craft beer to a need to challenge himself. But in the end, he simply wanted to create great craft beer. Armed with a self-written business plan, investment money from friends and family, a brewery to brew at, and an award-winning local brewmaster in brewer David Lusk, Clarke brewed Airdale‚Äôs first batch in August. And his gamble paid off. Now Airdale‚Äôs three beers‚ÄîAltitude (an American pale ale), Horizon (an American Hefeweizen), and Homecoming (a spiced holiday porter)‚Äîcan be found in more than a dozen notable local establishments, including the USS Midway Museum, Local Pub & Eatery, Point Loma Sports Grill & Pub, and Neighborhood.
Airdale‚Äôs success stems from the fact that Clarke and Lusk use only the finest malts and hops available, paired with premium yeast strains and water tailor-conditioned for each specific beer style. And San Diego serves as the perfect backdrop for such a launch, with its unbeatable aviation culture and more than 30 microbreweries and brewpubs located in the area. ‚ÄúI wanted

Common recyclables include paper, plastic, cardboard, plasterboard and wood- although skips don‚Äôt always contain these sorts of materials, therefore they have to be taken to the landfill site, where they‚Äôll be disposed of.

I also tried out a new workout I learned from Coach Fred Benlein, the director of the USATF Level One School I attended on Long Island last weekend: the Neuromuscular-Based Regeneration Run. The purpose of the workout is to develop the alactic energy system, and the workout is 20*(30 sec hard, 30 sec easy). Coach Benlein suggested that (150m hard, 50m easy) on the track turns out to be around 30 sec for each for most people, and it eliminates the need to stare at your watch the whole time, so I opted for this. Though it was not a problem to run 150m hard in 30 seconds (I actually ran all the repeats I did in 25-29 seconds), it was killer to run many of them in a row with only 30 seconds rest between them and I only made it through 8 reps, even with a break halfway through!

The two play lifelong best friends who are married but getting a divorce while still planning to remain best friends.
It's like the ultimate amicable divorce, though it doesn't ever feel like it's for particularly solid reasons and, as audience members, it becomes increasingly difficult to buy into the divorce because Celeste and Jesse are so good together, both because they work together as characters and because Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg have a delightfully playful and emotionally satisfying chemistry together.

A battery of tests showed the 50-year-old had a 10kg tumour in her abdomen, the size of a football. Doctors from SIMS Hospital in Vadapalani removed the mass in a challenging procedure performed earlier this week, and gave the woman a new lease of life.
Speaking on the surgery Dr S Rajasundaram, director and senior consultant - surgical oncology, said, "The tumour secreted a lot of jelly-like material which had engulfed the entire abdomen and caused significant breathlessness to the patient. After careful evaluation, we decided to perform a procedure called cytoreductive surgery with chemotherapy."
The procedure, performed over 10 hours, consisted of meticulously removing diseased portions in the abdominal cavity followed by circulating heated chemotherapeutic agents during surgery.
"This would ensure that drugs have maximum effect to control the tumour cells. The procedure results in prolonged survival of abdominal cancer patients," he said, adding that Rajam had recovered well and could go home soon.
