To locate the source of a leak it’s always best to start with a dry area, if at all possible. After removing the sink cabinet contents, I thoroughly wiped the water supply lines and the inside of the cabinet dry with a towel. There was also a tiny bit of mold forming so I wiped it off using a mold remover. Starting with a dry area allows you to easily see new drips.
I turned on the cold water tap and let the water run for about a minute. No leak. Next I tried the hot water tap. Ah hah – there it was!
I turned off the hot water tap, and with a dry paper towel, wiped off the current drips, then turned the hot water tap on again to see exactly where it was leaking from. My first thought was that the water was leaking at one of the connections between the faucet, the water softner and the water supply lines. As it turned out that wasn’t the case.
Upon closer inspection, the drips appeared to be coming from within the kitchen faucet itself. Like many people, I turned to the web for repair help, but the only leak repair instructions to be found were for dripping spouts or leaks at the base of the spout. My kitchen

The cold water faucet or valve must be turned on and fully open. Check the household faucet to see if the cold water faucet is turned on. Make sure to completely open the faucet for proper fill.
Check for any kinks in inlet hose, which can restrict water flow. If the inlet hose is kinked, it will get no water at all because there is only one inlet hose on this washer.
Replace inlet hose after 5 years of use to reduce the risk of hose failure. Periodically inspect and replace inlet hose if bulges, kinks, cuts, wear, or leaks are found.
There is an inlet valve on the back of your washer where the water inlet hose connects. On the inside of the valve, there is a screen to keep water contaminants from entering your washer. Depending on your water hardness, that screen can become clogged with sediment over time. This will cause the machine to fill slowly.
Check that inlet valve screen has not become clogged.
Whirlpool recommends that appliances be directly connected to the water supply for optimum machine performance. Using anti-flood devices can reduce the water pressure and amount of water entering the appliance.

●LED color changes according to water temperature.
●LED light is powered by four AA batteries, and will be activated once the water is turned on.
●No need to change the AA batteries in one year.
●AA batteries are not included in the package.
The LED faucet can add beauty to almost any sink and is activated through water pressure with the ability to turn off automatically. In addition, a light alert is there for telling the water temperature. The light will turn a red color from blue when the water temperature rises above 40 degrees centigrade. This makes the LED faucet great for kids, acting as a warning and thus, protection against too hot water. The light fits on many standard nozzles. It works as soon as water passes through, turning on the blue LED faucet lights.

Welcome back to ‘What’s Your Eddy IQ?’ This week we asked: A dripping faucet helps the pipes from freezing – True or False?
Most of us know the winter drill: run the faucet to protect the pipes. While seemingly obvious to many, taking this preventive step can really save the home owners expensive water damage costs.
Allow a slow drip to reduce pressure. It doesn’t matter how fast the drip is, the slower the drip, the less water wasted.
It is crucial to run hot and cold water on multiple faucets. Also, let warm water drip overnight, preferably from a faucet on an outside wall.
Don’t neglect to run the faucets in colder and more vulnerable areas of the home.
Don’t turn off the faucet even if the dripping stops. Ensure to keep your faucet turned on overnight regularly, as a safeguard measure.
Make sure to drip your faucets regularly this winter! For further information on frozen pipes and their devastating consequences, take a look at our most recent blog post, “Avoiding Frozen Pipes this Cold Season – Are You at Risk?” .

A faucet compression valve uses a stem that rotates when you turn the faucet handle. When you rotate the handle counterclockwise, the washer attached to the end of the stem compresses against the valve seat inside the faucet body, shutting off the supply of water to the shower head. Over time, the shower valve seat becomes worn, and the water cannot be turned off completely. Replacing the worn valve seat repairs the shower faucet and stops the flow of water.

Before Christmas, my husband and I sat down and made a list of all the home improvements we want to make to the house. Some things are small, like a fresh coat of paint in the living room and others are pretty big jobs, like a kitchen overhaul.
While redoing the kitchen can be a little intimidating, we decided we are going to tackle it on piece at a time. With our master list in hand, we can do one thing at a time and before we know it the kitchen will be done.
No one got hurt (too bad) and there was no fighting. I call that a successful home improvement project.
The first thing we tackled was new countertops. Since this isn’t our forever home, we decided to skip installing granite or a nicer counterop and, instead, replaced the laminate. Over the course of a weekend, we took off the old and installed the new! It’s already a huge improvement to our outdated kitchen.
Next on the list is a new sink and faucet! I have dreams of a farm house sink, but I know that will have to wait until the next house. Instead, I’ll take an updated faucet that will help give that feel to the kitchen.
I have it narrowed down to two faucets. The first is the Cardale Kitchen Faucet featuring a Sweep Spray (TM) that creates a forceful blade of water designed to sweep away stuck-on food from

According to Buzzfeed, Sophia has loved bugs pretty much her whole life. Her mom, Nicole Spencer, explains that her fascination began when she gave the child a bug-catcher when she was just a toddler. It was love at first bzzzz, and the little girl has been mad about insects ever since.
“Her best friend and her named themselves ‘The Bug Hunters’ — a name she still uses today,” Spencer shares. “For some reason I cannot explain, she has a connection with bugs.” Sadly, she had to separate from her bug-hunting best buddy when the family moved to a new town, meaning Sophia started at a new school.
Spencer says her daughter’s special relationship with bugs has other kids calling her a “weirdo” and taunting her in ways that would make any parent’s stomach turn. From being “dragged through mud” and hit, to a girl telling the other kids to stop playing with Sophia, the child has had a hard time adjusting to her new school. The most cringe-inducing instance of bullying? A boy who asked to see one of her bugs then stomped on it and killed it.

The 16-year-old girl was experiencing a shortness of breath after attending a One Direction concert. She decided that having been over excited and screaming over zealously she would sleep it off, thinking that her throat just needed time to recuperate.
The next day the teen woke up to find that she was still short of breath so she went to the Emergency Room. Initially, medical attendants thought little of the injury thinking that it was simply a sore throat due to the screaming at the concert. However, after closer inspection, they came to find there was something odd going on. Although her lungs sounded fine when doctors pressed down on her skin around her neck there was a weird feeling.
“It felt like they were crushing Rice Krispies beneath their fingers,” Dr.Slaughter Jr. stated, the resident of Emergency Medicine at the time.
This condition is called Crepitus which is caused when air leaks into soft tissue beneath the skin. When pressed upon the skin will make sounds similar to that of Rice Krispies cereal and milk. Having discovered this condition Doctors jumped into action and ran more tests on the teen.

She rolls from front to back but isn’t too concerned with being on the move. At this age, she is very into her surroundings, wanting to watch and touch everything. Also everything goes in the mouth, but no teeth to be found yet!
We started solids with her and are doing the baby-led weaning approach which basically skips the purées and goes straight to giving them very soft pieces of food and allowing them to use hand-eye coordination to self feed. Think: avocados, bananas, sweet potatoes, etc.
She had her very first virus which gave her her first ear infection in December.

Can I use normal water for rice cerelac instead of hot water?
Yes, you can mix infant cereal with formula no problem.
I don't believe there would be any real side effects or benefits from a 2 year old having infant cereal. If he wants some, I would only give a small amount to avoid spoiling his appetite for more nutritious food for him. Just one thing to be careful about though; babies and toddlers feeding out of a bottle for hours at a time can cause tooth decay. It is quite common unfortunately...

The musical, produced by Bay Area Children’s Theatre, was a high-energy production packed with fun songs and silly dances that had kids grooving in their seats.
The musical, with Book, Music, and Lyrics by Scott Elmegreen, is based on the beloved book series by David Soman and Jacky Davis. Ladybug Girl and Bumblebee Boy, the Musical is a touring show directed by Benjamin Hanna and choreographed by Khalia Davis.
The entire production was seamless and captivating, with bright costumes and non-stop excitement. Ladybug Girl (Khalia Davis) is on a mission to be big! She helps her friend, Sam, (Nik Duggan), discover his inner bug-power and, together, they go on imaginative adventures and recruit even more bug friends to form the Bug Squad! The new team, which now includes Butterfly Girl (Leah Sangitini) and Dragonfly Girl (Isabell To), must stick together to battle the Mean Alien in disguise as Ladybug girl’s brother (Kelvyn Mitchell). The actors were all fantastic. They were energized and enthusiastic, with strong voices and dance moves.
Davis’ Ladybug Girl is all parts adorable, funny, and confident, and started off the show with the empowering song “I Can Do It.” Duggan’s Sam was a perfect match with Davis. He sings about being a hero in “Pretend I’m Great” and then joins up with Davis to become Bumblebee Boy! Together they sing the super-charged “Nothing Can Stop Us” and head off to battle their imaginary villains. Soon the Bug

Mild-tasting, easily digested, and packed with iron, rice cereal is definitely the perfect first food for babies. That is, unless your perfect baby rejects it. Fortunately, even if your daughter continues to turn up her little nose and clench her tiny lips each and every time a spoonful of rice cereal comes her way, she won't go hungry. It's not the cereal your baby needs — it's the iron in the cereal. And while rice cereal is certainly an excellent source of that essential mineral, it doesn't hold a monopoly on it. In fact, because some studies have found high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice cereal, the FDA recommends infants (as well as children and pregnant women) eat variety of foods to offset any potential exposure to arsenic.
If your baby is bottle-fed, she's getting all the iron she needs from enriched formula. If she's breastfed, you can easily meet her requirement by giving her a supplement (ask your pediatrician for a recommendation). Besides, at this point in her dining career, solids are largely for the experience of spoon-feeding, not for nutrition. She's still getting most of what her growing body needs in liquid form.
But there are good reasons not to surrender when your baby rejects cereal. An older baby may become even more resistant to learning how to chew and swallow, preferring

For those of us living with our significant other it can often feel as if the only alone time we get alone is while we are in the bathroom. But, if you are in a relationship where you are actually ok with sharing that bathroom time, consider showering with your parter.
Not only is this a fantastic way to get close with your beloved, but it is a great way to conserve the amount of water you use. Plus, you use less energy heating your water, thus saving money on your energy consumption.
The skeptic would say that showering two at a time takes longer and may end up using the same amount of energy, but I can tell you from experience that it does not. In fact, I end up spending less time in there because I don't just sit under the running hot water meditating. If I did that, the my girlfriend (being out of the hot water) would get cold. And nobody wants a cold girlfriend.
So by showering together, we conserve double the amount of water and energy we would have used had we showered individually and we get to spend some more quality time together. Pretty cool that by taking showers with our beloveds we can help conserve the Earth's resources.

Peterson did not attend the meeting and did not provide a list of advisory committee members to the commission.
In Peterson's absence, Stotler and Commissioner Thomas R.

The Morgan County Courthouse was destroyed by an August 2006 fire, and the county government offices have been in trailers set up in the courthouse parking lot. The estimated cost for the new courthouse building is about $13 million. Funding has not yet been finalized.

But cooling a high-density data center and conditioning sophisticated laboratories without using a lot of energy is very challenging. Integral Group assisted NREL throughout design development in facing these challenges to create the world’s most energy-efficient data center to date.
We determined that in Colorado’s climate, compressor-free cooling could be used in the ESIF data center year-round. We designed low-approach cooling towers to supply medium-temperature (71°F) chilled water to the server rooms. The medium-temperature water cools both the high performance computing (HPC) system and the rest of the servers in the data center, eliminating the need for expensive and failure-prone chillers.
In the data center, Integral Group designed rear-door heat exchangers to cool the servers. These cooling coils trap the hot air exhausted by the servers and immediately cool it with the medium-temperature chilled water. As a result of this careful design, the ESIF data center operates at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.06.
ESIF’s office and laboratory areas were also designed to conserve energy as well. A moderate window-to-wall ratio, increased floor and roof insulation, and triple-element windows improve the Facility’s insulation value, and contribute to the thermal comfort of NREL’s employees. Additionally, the heat that is generated by the HPC is harvested and used to heat the offices and labs, reducing the heat load for the facility.

I defrosted a pound of turkey cutlets and then cooked them in the George Foreman (went a lot faster than I thought it would). Then I hand shredded it all into a pan filled with a jar of Prego Fresh Mushroom sauce. I served it over a bed of Bertolli bagged tortellini. I made two bags of the tortellini so that I could feed my family of three (Boy is on formula only) with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. It took me less time and mess than the hamburger, and probably is better for us! It was super tasty too.

With a little know-how, you can even replicate your favorite Hamburger Helper recipes from scratch and let your kitchen creativity shine.
Brown the hamburger on the stove. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat for five minutes. Add a small amount of cooking spray or oil to the pan, then immediately add the hamburger. Break up the meat as it cooks with a spoon or spatula.
You want the meat to cook until it is well-browned all over and no pink remains. At medium-high heat this will usually take five to seven minutes, but feel free to cook longer as needed.
Drain the grease from the hamburger. Depending on how lean your ground beef was, you may have just a little grease in the pan or quite a bit. There are a few different ways to drain it — see below for suggestions.
One easy option is to set a metal colander in a large glass bowl, then pour the contents of the pan into the colander. The grease will drain into the bowl, where you can allow it to cool and transfer to the garbage.

Retrieved Text: What colour should my ground beef be?
Many people in North America use the terms ground beef / Ground Hamburger / Hamburger interchangeably. For producers, in the US at least, there is a legal difference they must adhere to: any fat in ground beef must be the fat already adhering to the meat content they are adding; for ground hamburger, additional beef fat other than what was on those pieces of meat can be added.
When beef is ground, far more surface area is created on all the minute pieces of meat than existed on a single hunk of meat. Combine this increased surface area with the extra handling and equipment that the ground beef has had to go through, and the ground beef gets lots more chances to pick up bacteria during processing. The cow may have already had E. coli in its intestines, but the processing increases the chances of bacteria coming in contact with the meat.
Consequently, ground beef must have no pink inside when cooked. Colour alone, though, isn’t an indication of safety: sometimes hamburger can appear browned before it is safe to eat. It must reach an internal temperature of 71 C (160 F). If you’re nervous about this, instant-read meat thermometers are very inexpensive now.
Varieties of ground beef are now being sold as regular, lean, extra lean, super lean, etc.
But what does regular, lean and extra-lean mean? The labelling laws can be unclear.
In any other kind of food labelled 10g fat per 100g serving, the math would indicate that the fat content was

If you’re feeling sassy, chop up a few jalapeños and add them when you season the meat.

Ask your butcher for spider steak. Count on 5 ounces per person, 7 ounces for bigger appetites. Take the meat out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking it so that it’s at room temperature. Heat a drop of oil in a pan and sear the meat on all sides until it’s well browned. You may lightly salt the meat at this moment (not before, or the juices of the meat will escape during cooking). Remove the steaks from the pan, and add a knob of butter to the pan. When the butter is foaming, return the meat to the pan and turn it frequently to “nourish” it for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the meat rest for 3 to 4 minutes.

My usual example, from 30 years ago now, is the Applied Materials salesman chatting with a prospect at the then notorious Wagon Wheel in Mountain View. In the course of the conversation, the salesman claimed that Applied Materials' then arch rival, Hugle Industries, was in serious financial trouble and was rumored to be heading for bankruptcy. Unbeknownst to salesman or prospect, standing behind them and overhearing them was the founder of Applied Materials' rival, William Bell Hugle. That was a Friday evening. On Monday morning, a $1,000,000 trade libel suit by Hugle Industries arrived at Applied Materials' front door.
After a lot of lawyerly skirmishing, the case was dismissed with Applied Materials paying some legal expenses of Hugle Industries, a pretty unremarkable event. Had it gone to trial, the stakes were pretty large. If the Applied Materials salesman hadn't had good reason to believe the truth of his statement, a large judgement could have resulted. The libel was not merely of Hugle Industries products, where more latitude is allowed for "salesman's puffing", but of Hugle Industries business and financial reputation, where the rules are stricter.

A ride on a resort shuttle bus can be very educational. At least that has been my experience. We rode from our Grand Mayan resort here on the Mayan Riviera into Playa Riviera yesterday and the conversation turned to timeshares.
Timeshares and drinking before noon!
The man sitting behind me had been a timeshare salesman for Marriott in Hawaii in a former life. He talked about the timeshare salesman's life. He had worked for Wyndham before getting the job in Hawaii. He talked about beginning his job.
Marriott would not let me do any sales until they had "de-sleazed" me. They would send me around with other salesmen. If I even opened my mouth they would kick me under the table. Marriott prides themselves in being the gentlemen of the timeshare industry.
Is that true? I know that when we bought our Grand Mayan week (not a Marriott property), the sales staff began at the front desk and continued unrelenting until we made the purchase. I think we were lied to but I guess the experience is seen in the eyes of the beholder. In Puerta Vallarta the woman at the front desk is famous around the timeshare holders world.

Well, we can all believe now.
Chapman made history in last night’s loss to the Padres by throwing a 105-mph fastball. Check it out here.
As Steve Henson of Yahoo! Sports tells us, it was the fastest pitch ever recorded in a major league game. The previous record was held by Joel Zumaya, who threw a 104.8-mph fastball during a playoff game on October 10, 2006. Chapman’s pitch actually topped out at 105.1 mph, according to Brooks Baseball.
Chapman threw 25 pitches in total last night, all of them over 100 mph. In perhaps the most entertaining matchup of the night, Chapman got Adrian Gonzalez to swing-and-miss on three consecutive pitches in the bottom of the seventh inning that reached 102 mph, 102 mph and 103 mph.
In addition to his history-making heater, the southpaw touched 104 mph on three occasions.
Here’s what opposing manager Bud Black told Dan Hayes of the North County Times after the jaw-dropping performance.

Chie was out for most of the evening with Nozaki and Junchan, but I'd rather concientiously decided I ought to stay in and work, as this would be my last proper day at home to work on the thesis. It was a bit of a shame how things had worked out with Junchan - she'd come to stay in England for a month just as we were heading off to Japan.

When I arrived to Philippines in the middle of the night and after two stops and 21hours of flight, I began to wonder where I was going to spend the night. As I do not really plan when traveling alone, I sat at the airport to check out my “Lonely Planet”. Should I sleep here or should I go back to one of the 7100 islands of the archipelago?

My divert field was VFR, so I cancelled IFR and tuned the CTAF. I was number two for the airport until a bizjet called in on an umpteen-mile final and the guy in front decided to let him go first. Once I finally landed, I discovered a pleasant, well-equipped FBO and settled in to wait for the destination’s weather to improve.
Checking weather from the FBO lounge, it soon became clear the storm over my destination was moving off as it dissipated. But it also became clear it was moving toward my divert field. Wunnerful.
Another pilot, the guy who landed in front of me, was there for the same basic reason, so we introduced ourselves and swapped war stories. But I was growing restless. Soon, night had fallen, adding another element to planning my final leg home.

Everton, West Ham, Lyon and Marseille have all been linked with £25m-rated Les Bleus international.
"It's a determined no," says Wenger when asked if Giroud could still leave before the deadline.
Arsene Wenger has confirmed that he gave Olivier Giroud the chance to leave Arsenal this summer, but the powerful striker decided to stay put despite rumoured interest from a number of suitors including Everton.
Giroud proved to be the hero of the opening night of the 2017-18 Premier League season on Friday (11 August), demonstrating trademark strength to hold off centre-backs Harry Maguire and Wes Morgan to head home the winning goal in a thrilling 4-3 home defeat of plucky Leicester City.
Such an effort provoked scenes of sheer jubilation at the Emirates Stadium and came just two minutes after fellow substitute Aaron Ramsey looked to have rescued a point for the inconsistent Gunners after blasting in from close range.
Giroud's Arsenal future had been subject to considerable doubt after five years, with the £46.5m ($60.4m) club-record signing of Alexandre Lacazette expected to restrict his starting opportunities even further.
Ronald Koeman's Everton have been most heavily mentioned in connection with the £25m-rated 30-year-old, with the likes of West Ham United, Marseille and Lyon also credited with an interest.
However, Wenger insists that Giroud will remain in north London beyond the end of the transfer window despite being given the opportunity to move on and seek more regular football elsewhere.

After checking out various options in Spangmik, we arrived at Padma Home Stay. Since their rooms did not have attached toilet, so we decided to stay at their tents.
Situated only a short distance away from the lake, there were no tents or buildings between their tents and the lake. Hence unlike the other places we had checked out earlier, we had an unrestricted view of the Pangong Tso, of which we took full advantage of the next morning.
The tents themselves were fairly basic and each tent had 3 beds (a double bed and a separate single bed) along with the attached toilet.
Since the concrete structure on which the tents were made was built on a slope, it wasn’t properly leveled and was instead slanted. Due to it, be it the bed or the toilet, everything was slanted and that made sleeping on the bed a little comfortable. Then again, another luxury tent costing Rs. 2,500 I had seen a few minutes ago had a similar issue and the view from there was pretty bad.
The other issue was that their toilet seat was quite low, so you were actually squatting on it rather than sitting. However, there was running water and we did get hot water in a bucket early in the morning.

This demanded that she work from noon until 10:00 p.m. six days a week. Life at home was no longer normal, and it wasn’t long before they started to see changes in their son and daughter. Those changes became so pronounced that she decided her job was not worth the toll it was taking on her children. She gladly quit her job and returned home, deciding her children’s well-being was not worth the extra income. Everyone is much happier now. Most people think teenage children are fine with mom in a full-time job. Jana’s family proved otherwise.
In John 14: 3 Jesus told us, I go and prepare a place for you…that where I am, there you may be also. What a great picture of motherhood! Jesus didn’t go to prepare a special place for us and then leave a note on the counter saying, “I hope you enjoy your stay. See you later!” No! Heaven is special because we get to

Fluid retention around the eyes is one of the primary causes of puffiness. Although puffy eyes can affect you at any age, it becomes more of a concern as you become older because the skin around the eyes becomes thinner. Thin skin paired with fluid retention makes the veins around the eyes more visible. This creates the black-eye look of extreme puffiness. Puffiness occurs most commonly in the morning since the fluid builds up beneath the eyes as you sleep. Sinus problems and allergies can exacerbate the problem and make the puffiness more obvious.
Eye creams targeted for anti-aging help smooth the wrinkles around the eyes, which can temporarily reduce puffiness caused by normal aging. Choose a cream that smooths wrinkles, hydrates the skin and also contains elements targeted at reducing swelling and fluid retention.

The scouting moth circled the candle several times and came back with a description: The light was bright. Then a second moth went to examine it. He, too, came back with an observation: The light was hot. Finally a third moth volunteered to go. When he approached the candle he didn't stop like his friends had done, but flew straight into the flame. He was consumed there and then, and only he understood the nature of the light."

Why does the flame go out when the jar is covering it?
The substance that reacts with the candle wax is oxygen. It comes from the air. Putting the jar over the candle keeps oxygen from outside the jar from getting in. The reaction can only use the oxygen that is already in the jar. So, when that oxygen is used up, the reaction can’t keep going. Running out of oxygen makes the flame go out.
Another chemical reaction you probably know is the reaction between vinegar and baking soda. This reaction produces a gas called carbon dioxide. This gas can be used to put out a flame. Let’s try it!

I can’t think of a fire more common than a candle. We use them every day for light, for decoration, in churches or on cakes. But do you ever stop to think about what goes on inside a candle flame?
Well 17th century scientist Michael Faraday did, and he says, “There is no better…door to understanding…natural philosophy than by studying the physical phenomena of a candle.” In other words, we can learn a lot about fire science by looking inside a little candle flame.
To understand why, we need to know about something called the Fire Triangle. The 3 sides of a Fire Triangle represent the three things that you need to sustain a fire: oxygen, fuel, and heat. The three sides of a fire triangle are a bit like the three legs of a stool. If you have all three of them, the fire sustains itself and keeps burning, but if you remove one, the stool falls over and the fire goes out.
So where do the oxygen, fuel, and heat come from in a candle flame?
Well, the oxygen is the easiest. It comes from the air. The air we breathe is made of about 21% oxygen, and fires can keep burning in air with as low as 12% oxygen.
How about the fuel? Well, when we light a candle, we hold the fire to the wick,

Allow me to share a true story. While living in Dallas, I was experimenting with a single-LED flame effect. I had two candles: one (unmodified) was lit, while the second had the core removed so the wick could be replaced by a yellow/orange LED and a small SX microcontroller. I was comparing the light cast by each on a wall; I was looking for my artificial candle to closely approximate the real one.
At some point, the real candle went out. I reached for a match and instead of striking it on the box, I unconsciously touched the match head to the faux candle LED expecting it to light!

Retrieved Text: The number of home fires caused by candles has been soaring in recent years, and jumped a startling 20 percent from 1998 to 1999, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association).
Indeed, 1999 marked a 20-year peak; there were an estimated 15,040 home candle fires that caused 102 deaths, 1,473 injuries (a 33 percent increase over the previous year), and $278 million in damage. In contrast, in 1990, there were 5,460 home fires attributed to candles.
Candle fires are more common around the holidays, because more people use candles and decorations are often near them. Candle fires peak on Christmas day-they accounted for 10 percent of home fires on Christmas 1999-followed by New Year's Day and Christmas Eve. Home candle fires are more common in the winter months; in 1999, there were almost twice as many home candle fires in December as in an average month.
How does a little flame become so dangerous? Four out of 10 times, the candles were left unattended, abandoned or inadequately controlled. One in four times, something that catches fire easily was left too close to the flame. Sometimes children play with the candle. Sometimes someone falls asleep with one or more candles lit.
Four out of 10 home candle fires start in the bedroom, and two out of 10 in common rooms, living rooms, family rooms or dens. The most common item first ignited by a candle is a mattress or bedding, except in December when decorations are the most common first item.

I've come across my first instance with a solid black (red interior) reversible and was hoping for some wisdom. After studying miss cat's "Hoodoo Candle Magic..." book as well as reading the forum etc., I see that when the wax arcs out to form angel wings that means someone or the situation is being protected by an angel. Personally, I work a lot with both Archangel Michael and my Guardian Angels; however, how do I know if I am the person being guarded or if the person whom I'm reversing the work back to is being guarded? That person is a skilled enough practitioner to know that the work is being sent back.
That is a good question, but as i view it, the answer is somewhat encoded in the intention. If the wings had formed on a white candle dressed for blessing yourself, that would be a guardian for you. However, you are reversing to someone, not protecting from someone. The candle is directed at that person, not at you. Therefore, the wings represent the guardianship granted to the one whom you are attacking, not a guardian of yourself.
Thanks, miss cat. How this person could possibly have anything other than demonic entities guarding them, let alone an angel, escapes my and a bevy of other people's comprehension, but that is another topic.

Retrieved Text: Do I really have to trim the wick?
Yes, you really should trim the wick to 1/4 inch every time you light your candle. If you don’t, problems can occur. The wicks of all candles can “mushroom” at the top, causing excessive flickering and/or smoke. Keeping your wick trimmed keeps this to a minimum and makes your candle safer. Trimming also prevents your wick from curling back into the wax – a common problem with nonmetal-cored wicks. Because our wicks contain no lead, zinc, or metal of any kind, they are very easily trimmed before lighting.
My candle leaves a lot of wax on the sides of the container when I burn it. Why is that?
This is commonly called “tunneling.” This happens when a candle burns down the middle of the jar, leaving lots of wax stuck to the side of the jar. Tunneling can be caused by failure to keep your candle lit long enough before you extinguish it. Each time you burn a candle, try to burn it at least until the wax pool reaches the edge of the container. Our jar candles should be burned a minimum of 3 hours the first time they are lit to achieve this. On subsequent burns it is ideal for the candle to be burned for at least 2 hours, but never longer than 4 hours. If you must extinguish your candle early, plan to burn it a little longer the next time. This should prevent your candle from tunneling.

Using a gentle source of heat, they warm the essential oils and allow the healing properties of those oils to be inhaled and absorbed by the body, providing aromatherapy benefits. Because essential oils are available commercially, you can also create your own aroma lamp.
Use a perforated ceramic or glass tea candle holder with an open top through which the heat from the candle flame can rise. The perforations allow the candle to get air. It’s important to select a container that is flame resistant.
Find a small glass bowl which can sit securely on top of the tea candle holder. Very small dessert bowls work well. Ceramic tea cup plates, which have a well in the center, can also be used. Note that the thicker the glass or ceramic, the longer it will take for the candle to heat it. Again, anything you use should be flame resistant.
Place the tea candle in the holder, and the small glass bowl on top.
Put 10 drops of your choice of essential oils in the glass bowl (or tea cup well), then light the candle. The heat from the candle will warm the glass (or ceramic), causing the essential oil to slowly evaporate. Add additional oil as needed.
If the oil has evaporated completely, extinguish the candle and wait for the oil-holder to cool. Then add the additional oil.

The wax is a hydrocarbon similar to fuel that is used in vehicles. When the candle is lit, the surrounding wax begins to melt and is absorbed up through the wick. The heat of the flame will vaporize the liquid wax and that vapor is what is actually burning. When you blow out the flame, the resultant smoke that is visible is actually visible wax vapor. If the vapor is a continuous stream back to the wick, touching a lit flame will cause the candle to re-ignite.

It's been said he drank as hard as he worked, and while on a lecture tour in New York he collapsed after drinking heavily at the White Horse Tavern. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital and died several days later, on 9 November 1953.

Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, at the UCL Institute of Education, and Pennsylvania State University found that well educated parents of white children were most likely to allow their children to drink at age 14.
The study’s authors were keen to point out that while having better educated parents is generally a protective factor for children, previous research has shown that those who start drinking early are more likely to fail at school, have behaviour issues, as well as alcohol and substance problems in adulthood.
The study revealed that parents of white children who were employed, had more educational qualifications, and who drank alcohol themselves, were more likely to allow their adolescent children to drink than unemployed parents, those with fewer educational qualifications, and ethnic minority parents.
Parents who abstained from alcohol tended not to allow their children to drink, but among those who did drink, those fathers and mothers who drank heavily were no more likely to let their children drink alcohol than light or moderate drinkers.

A new study has found that heavy drinking can increase your chance of divorce—but only if one spouse is drinking significantly more than the other. According to researchers at the University of Buffalo, divorce rates are higher among couples that don’t share similar drinking patterns and that drinking the same amount as your partner is better for marriage whether you are a light drinker or a heavy drinker.
Lead author Kenneth Leonard followed over 600 couples through the first nine years of marriage, tracking how much each spouse drank and which couples suffered marital strife, separation, and divorce. He found that the divorce rate among couples in which one spouse drank heavily, 50 percent divorced in under a decade. The divorce rate among couples that drank similar amounts of alcohol was about 30 percent.
The study suggests that if both partners are light drinkers or if both partners are heavy drinkers, divorce is less likely. This could be because both partners have similar experiences with alcohol and have a greater tolerance for the negative experiences associated with heavy drinking.
Leonard warned that although his study suggests that heavy drinking by both spouses’ decreases the chance of divorce—it does not prove that heavy drinking means a good marriage. Drinking has been linked with domestic abuse, and heavy drinking by both partners could create a poor environment for children.

Ten pin bowling is the most fashionable form of bowling. In ten pin bowling, matches consist of each player bowling a game. Each game is divided into ten frames. A frame allows a bowler 2 chances to bang down all 10 pins. The number of pins knocked over in each frame is recorded, a running total is made beneath the specific frame score as each frame goes on, and the player with the highest score in his/her game wins the match. Scores can be greater than the actual number of pins knocked over if strikes or spares are bowled. A strike is scored when a player knocks down all pins on the first roll in the frame. Rather than a score of just 10 for the frame, the player's score will be 10 plus the total pins knocked down on the next two rolls in the next frame(s). A spare is scored when all pins are knocked down using the second roll in the frame.

Warm up: Count the bowling pins. Pick up two pins and put them behind your back. Ask “How many pins are left? Count together.
When bowling, younger students should stand midway on the mat so that it is easier to hit the pins. The younger students may find it easier to roll the ball from between their legs.

Materials Needed: tongue depressors (2), red and green paper, marker, circular object to trace, scissors, and a soccer ball.
1. Use a bowl or round object and trace a circle on each piece of paper.

For this very reason outside of the New England area Candlepins will be a difficult sell. Your job will be to educate your customer base about the game of Candlepins and how difficult it really is.

The game of Candlepins consist of ten frames (boxes) in which three balls are rolled unless a strike or spare is scored. Scoring can be done both vertically or horizontally. Scores are normally entered after three balls except in the case of strikes or spares.
In Candlepins the pins that have been knocked over remain on the playing field until the frame is over. Any fallen pin in the playing area may be used to assist you in knocking down the remaining pins. Pins that are in the gutter or out of play may not be used.

While bowling at Phillip’s Lanes, Knopp pulled off a trick shot nobody saw coming. He first released one bowling ball, which rolled along slow as can be, hugging the left gutter closely. Then, all of a sudden, he released a second ball, sending it down the lane at a much quicker pace.
The second ball beat the first ball to the bowling pins and knocked down all but one. Even if the stunt had ended there, Knopp would have been left with a possible spare. Not bad!
But then the first ball finally made its way down the lane and took out the remaining pin.
The end results sent Knopp running around and cheering. For good reason!
As you can imagine, this took quite a bit of time to master. But Knopp was willing to put the practice in to nail this shot.

Anyway, when my dad died over ten years ago, my awesome step-mother told me and all my brothers to take anything we wanted to remember Dad.
I wanted his bowling ball. Dad loved bowling and was on a weekly league for as long as I can remember.
So, last night, I carefully took the snazzy, silver ball out of its very old, leather bag. The zipper hadn’t been unzipped in a long, long time. I felt like I was exposing a tomb.
When I stood at the head of the long lane, holding Dad’s ball, one thought raced through my head.
“Dad had a smaller thumb than me,” I said to myself as I realized that my right thumb was a little snug in its hole. I hadn’t considered that potential problem. Perhaps I was a little caught up in the sentimental emotion.
But I let it roll.
And knocked seven pins down with ball one.
When Dad’s silver ball popped back up on the conveyor belt, I grabbed it and started back for roll number two. As I placed my three fingers in their holes, I noticed something funny in the thumb hole. It felt rough.
So I examined it. And couldn’t believe my eyes.

Bowling in Cambridge + Little Extra which will be towards the end of the video!
Ten-pin bowling is a sport in which a "bowler" rolls a bowling ball down a wood-structure or synthetic (polyurethane) lane and towards ten pins positioned at the end of the lane. The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible. Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball, and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages. The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine. While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries, the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world.
In Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, the game is commonly referred to as just "Bowling". In New England, "bowling" is usually referred to as "regular bowling", "ten-pin bowling" or "big-ball bowling", because of the smaller diameter, lighter weight ball used in the Worcester, Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880, and the similarly "small-ball" sport of duckpin bowling (conceived of by 1895), popular in the Northeast United States, as well as Canada's own sport of five-pin bowling, all three of which use smaller diameter, lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling, without the necessity for finger holes in them.

Twenty years ago, Ronald Phillips committed a horrific and unimaginable crime for which he was sentenced to death. He is forty years old now, and has spent half of his life behind bars. Now, Gov. John Kasich has delayed this evil man's long-overdue execution to see if the condemned man can donate a kidney to his mother.
The fact that this man is literally twice as old now as he was when he committed crimes worthy of death shows that the death penalty is a complete joke. The death penalty is meaningless when it is applied in such a manner. This man should have been put to death by the civil magistrate many years ago.
Almighty God makes it very clear in Scripture what He things of child murder and what He expects to happen to child murderers. God warns the nation of Israel in Leviticus 20:1-5 that those who sacrifice their children to the demon Molech are to be put to death, and that He will set His face against the Israelites if they do not execute those who commit this abomination. God further says in Jeremiah 7:31 and Jeremiah 32:35 that this crime is so horrible that it never even entered into His mind that men would do this.

The written history of Ving Tsun appears to have begun with a doctor named Leung Jan who lived in Foshan, a town in southern China. One of his renowned disciples was Chan Wah Shun, who in taught the system to Yip Man, who is considered the Grand Master of modern Ving Tsun. In 1949, Yip Man brought the style out of Fatshan, China to Hong Kong and eventually, through his disciples, to the rest of the world. In recent times, the greatest Master of the Ving Tsun system was the late Grandmaster Moy Yat, who was Yip Man's closest disciple for 15 years.
The Ving Tsun Kung Fu Clan now has the largest following in Hong Kong. The once little known style has become one of the most popular martial arts in the world today.
Since the death of Yip Man in 1972, there have been many who have tried to fill the void left by his absence. Where once there was only one ving tsun family, now there are many systems, each looking a little different from the rest, with most claiming to be "authentic" ving tsun (Wingtsun, Wing Chun, Weng Chun). This is not to say that all modern-day ving tsun is bad or wrong. True ving tsun is what is simple, efficient, and agrees with the principles on which that system is based. Anything else is wasteful, unnecessary and simply not ving tsun. Whether

In rural and urban settings, in work and leisure contexts and in spheres of social interaction in times of peace and war, man is always confronted with choices, and how choices are made. The book is further concerned with an artistic form through which man's behavior is best understood. In this regard, the ubiquitous use of imagery is intended to throw light on man's interaction with nature in the context of both the static (physical features and forces) and changing dynamics beyond man's control. Above all, it is also generally about how little winds of events, subtle warning whistles blowing in them, matter and lead to ultimate storms that may have been averted. From whatever angle life is viewed, man's resilience is dealt with rather implicitly in terms of how he deals with death, the height of man's gloom, and other tragic events, invariably evolving and transformed into man's cycles of hilarious and victorious moods.

Some of the dominant ideas in the novel involve (1) man's isolation, (2) man's relationship to the community, and (3) man's inhumanity to man. Many of these ideas will appear to be negative or pessimistic when viewed from the standpoint of the main character, Joe Christmas. But by focusing on Lena Grove at the beginning, Faulkner is first giving us a brief positive view. While it is true that Lena is now isolated and alone on the road, she almost instinctively knows that people will help her even though, as with Mrs. Armstid, some of them don't approve of her. Also, she will evoke positive and favorable responses from the community and will receive help from many people. In contrast to the bitter harshness which Joe Christmas evokes, Lena inspires kindness and compassion.
Basically, Lena is presented as a simple and relatively uncomplicated person with apparently a great strength and determination. She never complains of her lot and never asks help from anyone even though she willingly accepts assistance. She possesses a simple and basic faith in life. Her responses to life are the fundamental reactions founded on the concept of charity and hope. She believes that she will be with the father of her child when it is born.

So when the first holiday following Ger's death only heightened his family's grief, ARNI Foundation founder Nikki Linn decided the best gift she could give would be to carry out her half brother's wish.
Instead of exchanging gifts with her family, Linn began planning a trip to help rebuild Haiti, and along the way recruited the support of her friends and community.
Linn is teaming up with the Theophile Outreach Center of Brooklyn, which Andlinger's family designated to receive donations in lieu of flowers after Ger, a Connecticut resident, committed suicide. The nonprofit started its Hope for Haiti program in response to the January 2010 earthquake.
"He was the least likely kid you would think this would happen to," Linn said. "It was so bizarre. I still can't wrap my mind around it."

But like most of her charitable endeavors, Linn decided that if she was going to make the most impact, she would need to take matters into her own hands.

One of Ghirlandaio's best-known works, it is considered notable for its emotional poignancy. Its realism has been described as unique among the portraits of the Quattrocento.
The picture portrays an older man in a red robe, embracing a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds. Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage, and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown. It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence. The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.
An extraordinary feature of the painting is the deformity of the man's nose, evidence of rhinophyma. Ghirlandaio has presented the portrait in a naturalistic and sympathetic fashion, at variance with physiognomic theory of the era, which maintained a connection

Some of these survivors were utterly alone in the world. Others had family that had already arrived in Palestine, either before or after the war. My mother’s job was to deliver this second class of survivor to those relatives.
Mom, who had spent almost four years witnessing and experiencing Japanese atrocities, was left utterly shattered by one of these encounters. She knew that she was taking a young Polish man to his mother. Because of the language barrier, however, my mother did not know that the man’s mother, like her son, was herself a camp survivor who had arrived in Palestine only a short time before.

Dolezal could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted, according to KHQ.
Court documents allege Dolezal, who has legally changed her name to Nkechi Diallo, illegally received $8,747 in food assistance and $100 in child care assistance starting in August 2015 up until November 2017.
Investigators began looking into Dolezal's finances after learning she'd written a book, according to The Associated Press. Upon reviewing records, they reportedly found that she'd been listing her income as less than $500 per month.
However, subpoenaed records allegedly revealed bank statements showing Dolezal deposited nearly $84,000 into her bank account during the same period she was receiving public assistance. Those funds are believed to have come from the book, "In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World," and the sale of items like handmade dolls and soap on her website.
At one point, however, she reported a "change of circumstance" that disclosed she did a one-time job in October 2017 worth $20,000, court documents obtained by The Associated Press said.

Wasn't there a Ryan Smith return that was called back because he had originally called for a fair catch, the ball then bounced and he tried to return it??
Maybe, but that’s not a “fair catch” of a punt that bounced. What it is is a delay of game penalty I believe.
Correct. I wanna say Dudzik did this more than once.
I believe you might be referring to a play where he "motioned" and yelled at his teammates to get out to the way as the punt was kicked short and he ran up and caught and took off. The officials took his arm motion as a fair catch signal even though I don't remember his arms going above his head.

I remember that one clearly. I thought Phil Hansen was going to explode on the radio over that call. He kept saying it's common to wave off your teammate and he never had his arm up all the way.

Correct. A fair catch can only happen if the ball is "caught." By definition, a catch is gaining possession of a ball in flight. A recovery is gaining possession of a ball that has been grounded.

Catching a basketball the right away is probably one of the most important fundamental basketball skills that every basketball player need to learn. Why? Even if you're a great passer, your skills would be absolutely useless if your teammates cannot catch your passes and they turn the ball over to the defense most of the time.
As you can imagine, this would make it very difficult for you to successfully run your offense as a team, which would in turn decrease your chances of winning basketball games. With that said, let's examine the fundamentals of catching a basketball.
Fundamentals Of Catching A Basketball.
When you're trying to catch a basketball, you should not "fight" the basketball but relax your hands, shoulders and arms as much as possible and "give" with the basketball. Your hands should be out-stretched ready to receive the basketball and guide it to your body. The basketball should be caught with the fingers which are held cup shaped.
When a teammate drops a pass or fumbles the ball, it is usually because he took his eyes off the ball for a split moment in order to locate the position of his opponent. Hey may also be trying to receive the ball with one eye on the ball and the other eye on the opponent.
Instead, the player catching the basketball should "look the ball into his hands." And, it is only after the ball has been successfully received should he worry about his opponent or trying to score. Doing this would greately decrease his

The Poke Ball in original Japanese language versions) is a spherical device used by Pokemon Trainers to capture wild Pokemon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pokemon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pokemon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pokemon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily captured. Legendary Pokemon will resist being caught much easier, and will often require many Poke Balls or more powerful Poke Balls in order to catch them. If the player attempts to capture a non-player character's Pokemon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft, stating that it is illegal to capture a Pokemon already owned by a trainer.
As depicted in the anime and manga series, the Poke Ball, when not in use, is the size of a golf ball and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a baseball. The Pokemon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pokemon, a beam of red light converts the Pokemon into energy to reclaim it.

Once a defensive player has initially obtained a legal guarding position (feet on the floor, initially facing and there first), the defensive player may always move to maintain position and may even have one or both feet off the floor when contact occurs with the offensive player.
After obtaining a legal guarding position, the defensive player is allowed to move sideways, or backwards to stay in the path of the dribbler (but not directly into the dribbler).
Look to see who caused the contact! Dispel the myth.
A post player should be expected to be guarded as closely as possible from all sides. When a post player turns or rises to shoot and makes contact with a defensive player, who has obtained a legal guarding position, it is either a no call or a foul on the offensive player if the contact is such that an advantage is gained or the defence is placed at a disadvantage.
There is no restriction as to how high a player may bounce the ball, provided the ball does not come to rest in the player’s hand.

Q: What is the ruling if the ball hits the ground as it is pitched?
A: If a pitch touches the ground and bounces through the strike zone it is a "ball". If such a pitch touches the batter, he shall be awarded first base. If the batter hits such a pitch, the ensuing action shall be the same as if he hit the ball in flight.
Q: Is the hand considered part of the bat?
A: The hand is not part of the bat. Many people think that the hand is part of the bat and that a player shouldn't be awarded first if hit in the hand. This is incorrect. As long as the batter is attempting to get out of the way and is hit in the hand, then the correct call is to award the player first base.
Q: What happens if a pitch touches a players clothing but not the players body?
A: As long as the uniform is properly fitting, the batter should be awarded first base.
Q: What is the ruling if a pitched ball hits a batter and then hits the bat?
A: Once the ball hits the batter, the ball is dead and the batter should be awarded first base.
Q: Can a player be awarded Hit by Pitch (HBP) on a strike?

I am pretty sure that any player in the field (defense) can call a time out. Base runners? I would think if he has a base running reason like tying his shoe.
I’ve seen catchers call time to go talk to the pitcher on the mound.
And managers (the old looking guys that are in a baseball uniform but rarely come out of the dugout) can call time, usually to replace a pitcher.
That last is an interesting evolution that is not in the rule book. The manager calls time out. There is a place for each team, adjacent to the field that is called the Bullpen. Essentially just a long narrow area where pitchers can warm up while the game is in progress.
The manager gets to the mound and starts talking to the pitcher–many times the catcher also comes out to the mound. The pitcher is most likely holding the ball. So, while you cannot hear what they are saying out there, you keep your eye on the ball. If the pitcher gives the ball to the manager, that means he is being relieved. The manager then passes the ball to the relief pitcher, and usually jogs off the field (remember, they are usually old guys). Play continues when the Umpire signals it.

Coach Jim Huber, probably one of the best basketball curriculum producers in the USA, has developed a competitive game drill that will boost confidence, fun, and results to master finishing over helpside defenders off of a ball screen.
1.	Place two cones at the top of the key. The cones represent the feet of the screener.
2.	Player 1 has the ball on offense and starts at half court.
3.	Player 2 is on defense and starts opposite of Player 1 at the block.
4.	The drill is initiated when Player 1 hard dribbles downhill, fakes one way then gets even with the cones (the use of the ball screen).
5.	When Player 1 is dribbling downhill, Player 2 sprints to the opposite block then runs up to immediately help by contesting and defending Player 1.
6.	If Player 1 scores, they stay on offense.
7.	If Player 2 gets a stop, they then rotate and play offense.
To effectively use a ball screen, players must set up their primary defender by getting them below the screen. Once a defender is caught on the screen, it is difficult to get out.
If they do get out, the ball handler should go shoulder to shoulder with the screener, allowing no air space for the caught defender to escape. This leads to the primary defender getting beat and chasing from behind, leading to

For example, high school football enforces kickoff rules based on the field layout and ability level of the players.
Along with the general outline and markings on the field, an X is painted on the middle of each 40-yard line to indicate the location of the tee position for the kicking team. However, the kicker can move the tee to another location on the same line if he chooses. The kickoff marks the beginning of each half of the game along with the transfer of possession after a touchdown or field goal. Each team has to have 11 players on the playing field during the kickoff.
The kicking team is allowed to line up on its own end of the field behind the 40-yard line. The layout and positioning of the players can change as long as every player is behind the 40-yard line. As the kicker approaches the ball, he must kick the ball before any of the other players cross the 40-yard line.

Working on your fitness level is important of course, so jogging, aerobics and working out in the gym would be one option. Rope skipping is very good, because it improves both your fitness level and your coordination.
But there is a technical aspect to it. One thing you should learn is the split step. Next time you watch a tennis game on TV, do not follow the ball but watch one player all the time. You will see that whenever the opponent hits the ball, the receiving player seems to jump up a little bit. Actually, he pushes himself off the ground, lands with his feet a little wider apart and in a "ready-to-move" position. It is like a wake-up call to the muscles, making them ready for a sprint towards the next ball.
Another function of this split step is for the player to be in a balanced position facing the opponent, so that he is able to start in either direction. By properly executing the split step, you will never be caught on the wrong foot, and you will shorten your reaction time.
You have to extra work to do the split step, but the upside is you will have more time to get to the ball, thus reducing the amount of energy needed to reach that next ball.

The Italian player had no way of avoiding the ball.
To me clearly accidental offside yet the ref gives a potential game winning penalty decision.
Anyone else see this and thought it was wrong?
I saw one and I remember thinking "That looked harsh".
I remember Dellaglio commentating on a game about 2 yrs ago and the gist of his comment was "If the offside player didn't have time to react, [he] would always consider it accidental offside". It makes sense to me.
Not seen it, but what springs to mind in these situations is OB's concept that "not much happens at these levels that is accidental" or somesuch. The actual incident may have been accidental - but the player might have been there deliberately "just in case". I reiterate though I haven't seen the footage for this specific incident(s).
Why would a player deliberately put himself in a position to concede a scrum at best and a PK at worst?
Ie what possible advantage are they gaining?
you'd have to ask the players that did it. Though I'd offer as an possibility that its running interference so the team mate takes the ball cleanly and the defense cannot get to him immediately or get to challenge for the ball initially. Then the team mate knocks on and the ball hits him totally accidentally. so the knock-on and hitting him is accidental - but his presence there wasn't and was

Las Vegas — A Nevada state court judge overseeing a potentially $2 billion jury trial over the alleged bladder cancer risks of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.’s blockbuster diabetes medication drug Actos announced Wednesday that the drug company and two plaintiffs had tentatively resolved their claims, likely ending a trial that began in August and was expected to continue for weeks.
Judge Jerry Wiese told attorneys outside the jury’s presence that a tentative deal had been struck, and that the jury would likely be released on Monday pending final negotiations amongst the parties. Details of the deal were not disclosed in court. A Takeda spokeswoman confirmed a tentative agreement had been reached and was being finalized by the parties, and an attorney for the plaintiffs declined to comment.
The trial had been recorded gavel-to-gavel up to that point by Courtroom View Network.
The plaintiffs, a man who developed bladder cancer and the family of a man who died from the disease, chose not to opt into a $2.4 billion settlement agreement that will resolve most of the roughly 8,000 Actos lawsuits pending throughout the country.

Ghandri is also suspected of playing a role in two other attacks in Tunisia that killed 60 people, mainly tourists, in 2015.
According to a statement from judicial officials, during the court session Ghandri ran at the judge, managed to seize his gavel and hit him on the head. It was not clear if the judge was injured in the incident.
Earlier this month, a Tunisian court jailed seven people for life for their involvement in the two deadly militant attacks in 2015, one on a museum in Tunis and the other on a hotel in a Mediterranean resort. The assault on the Bardo National Museum left 21 people dead, while 38 were killed in the beach resort of Sousse, some 150 kilometres south of the capital.

Well Judge Brooks has finally gotten what was coming to him. On April 4, 2008, the California Commission on Judicial Performance issued a “public admonishment” of Brooks. They had threatened to do worse but let Brooks off light because he agreed to resign from the bench and never seek judicial office or assignment again.
This is great news. But what I’m really wondering is: what took the Commission so long to get this bad egg off the bench? Just think of all the people’s lives he ruined while wielding the gavel in the meantime. And what about all the other bad eggs that are still on the bench to this day? It looks like the Commission is willing to tolerate a lot of bad judicial behavior before they’re willing to finally step in and do something about it. The system is clearly broken. What is to be done?
Meanwhile, Ms. Reinglass has the distinct pleasure of now having to re-try an exhausting case from 3 years ago, thanks to Brooks. Let’s hope her new judge is a step up from Brooks.
Here’s a link to the Commission’s Decision and Order Imposing Public Admonishment in the matter concerning Judge James Brooks.
What ever happened to judicial temperament? This guy sounds like an extreme case–a fine example of a judge who doesn’t have that good stuff.

At 25, he had married Anne Dudley, 16, his childhood sweetheart. Anne had been well tutored in literature and history in Greek, Latin, French, Hebrew, as well as English.
The voyage on the "Arbella" with John Winthrop took three months and was quite difficult, with several people dying from the experience.

As Anne tells her children in her memoirs, "I found a new world and new manners at which my heart rose [up in protest.]"a. However, she did decide to join the church at Boston. As White writes, "instead of looking outward and writing her observations on this unfamiliar scene with its rough and fearsome aspects, she let her homesick imagination turn inward, marshalled the images from her store of learning and dressed them in careful homespun garments."

On the Slave Coast of West Africa in 1880, a land governed by witchcraft and superstition and where human life was cheap, torture by poisoning and boiling oil was the order of the day. Twins, believed to be children of the devil, were abandoned to die, and the mothers banished. But into that suffering came a woman who had been afraid to cross the street alone, who once refused to cross a field because there was a cow in it, who was terrified of crowds and public speaking. She immediately contracted malaria, responding with, “Heaven is now nearer to me than Britain.” Many times she looked death in the face—everything from crocodiles to angry witch doctors with cauldrons of oil. Meanwhile, she began saving twins from slaughter. If all the twins she rescued had remained alive, they would make up a big town, and it was her own money she used in all this endeavor. She said Christ had sent her with the Gospel and that He would look after the results.

The international perception of Nepal is often that it is a poor but happy society. But behind the sweet smiles of the women you may encounter on your Himalayan trek, is often a story of extreme discrimination, hardship, deprivation and abuse. Men, especially those from poor areas, with little education or prospects of a decent job, are apt to drink and take their frustration out on those of lower status than themselves – their wives and children.
Low-caste girls are at the bottom of the social heap. According to tradition, when girls start menstruation they are locked away in a darkened room for at least 7 days, and not allowed in the kitchen because they are unclean, nor to see the sun or a man because both are ‘god’.

Lately, I have been reading a lot of Italian fairy tales as a kind of inspiration and preparation for the new novel I am working on, a companion to The Innamorati.

Among the fairy tales I have been reading there appears a creature who is rarely ever seen for she is merely a place holder in the climatic tension of the story's finale: she is the bride the Prince almost marries, because he is too foolish, too enchanted, or too impatient (not waiting those seven years) and impulsively plans a wedding with the wrong woman. Of course, the heroine bride arrives in the nick of time, challenging the Prince to recall his vows of love. The Prince is chastened and then furious, turning to the almost bride (and sometimes just married bride) and denouncing her -- as if it were her fault he screwed up.

A discussion led by Ann Fessler, the film’s director, will follow the screening.
WHEN: Thursday, March 21, 2013 at 7 p.m.
DETAILS: At a time when “nice girls” didn’t get pregnant, women were expelled from high schools and colleges and forced to leave jobs as teachers and nurses before their indiscretion was apparent to others. They were rendered voiceless and invisible—banished to the towns of distant relatives or maternity homes to give birth and surrender their children.
For the past 30 years, Ann Fessler has focused on the stories of women and the impact that myths, stereotypes, and mass media images have on their lives and intimate relationships. Between 2002-2005, Fessler conducted over 100 interviews with women who lost children to adoption during the 28 years that followed World War II, when a perfect storm of circumstances led to an unprecedented number of surrenders.

Yes. A woman over 18 years of age has all the rights to buy property and full ownership rights on property bought by her or willed to her or gifted to her. She can sell or give it away as a gift or through a will.
These rights are not changed due to marriage.
What are the rights that daughters have over parents’ property?
Daughters have equal right of inheritance as sons to their father's property. They also have a share in the mother's property. This is true for property self-acquired by the parent. The rules, however, differ for ancestral property (inherited by the parent), based on whether the parent was alive as of September 2005 or not. For example, if the parent passed away before the Hindu Succession Act, 2005 came into effect, she cannot claim a share in ancestral property.
How about their rights over her husband’s and in-law’s property?
Marriage does not confer automatic rights to a wife over her husband’s property. She can inherit it only after his lifetime and that too only based on the will. In case of the husband’s ancestral property, there are no rights and she can only inherit it from the deceased husband.

The name of the syndrome is derived from a botched bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. In August 1973 four employees of Sveriges Kreditbank were held hostage in the bank’s vault for six days. During the standoff, a seemingly incongruous bond developed between captive and captor. One hostage, during a telephone call with Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, stated that she fully trusted her captors but feared that she would die in a police assault on the building.
The most infamous example of Stockholm syndrome may be that involving kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

The moments after exiting a helicopter can be among the most dangerous, as illustrated by the extreme vigilance of the Army soldiers after jumping out of a Black Hawk near Baghdad in 2005.
In April 2004, an Iraqi group kidnapped four Italian workers off the streets of Baghdad.
There were subsequent demonstrations in Rome, but not as part of a call for troop withdrawal; fortunately the kidnappers failed to follow through on their threat of further executions.
Several weeks later, the same group of kidnappers abducted a Polish worker from his company’s Baghdad office.
Intensive investigation by agents with the top-secret USAISA (U.S. Army Intelligence Support Activity), aided by information from Polish intelligence units, enabled them to track and tap the cell phones of the kidnappers and locate the compound where the hostages were being held near Ramadi, 80 miles northwest of Baghdad.
Additional surveillance enabled operatives to learn the kidnappers’ routines and time the rescue for maximum effectiveness and minimum likelihood of casualties.

The U.S. ambassador and the top American military spokesman held out hope the operation on the outskirts of Baghdad could lead to a break in the captivity of American reporter Jill Carroll, a freelance writer for The Christian Science Monitor who was abducted Jan. 7.

Conducting relations with “rogue states,” namely sovereign states who disregard human rights or other international norms, for example, raises the concern that we are helping to legitimize governments and practices we otherwise strongly condemn. Nonetheless, as some have argued, there may be an obligation to negotiate with such a state when it comes to grave security issues like weapons of mass destruction. How do the alternatives to negotiation impact the moral considerations involved in dealing with such states?
Like “rogue states,” non-state armed groups come in different forms, from political insurgencies to criminal organizations to millenarian groups. Often these actors are designated collectively as “terrorists,” a term for which there is no academic consensus—and which, it has been argued, hinders prospects for negotiation and fosters entrenched violence. Does negotiating with non-state actors, through official state channels or otherwise, undermine the international order by conferring a legitimacy and authority traditionally granted only to states? Or does legitimacy in some cases attain to non-Westphalian groups? How should states balance the risks of attributing legitimacy to unsavory actors against the possibility of escalated violence stemming from a refusal to negotiate?
When confronted with non-state hostage takers, many governments insist that they will not negotiate, but in practice exceptions abound. Recently, the Obama administration has indicated that it will no longer bar the families of hostages from paying ransom to kidnappers, despite the fact that the U.S. government will not pay ransom or engage

The captors, from Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, fled the southern island of Simusa Friday, bringing their hostages with them, said military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gerry Besana.
One Indonesian fisherman, Heri Ardiansyah, was rescued as the militants tried to flee, but another - Hariadin - drowned in the escape bid.
Another hostage, Malaysian Jari Abdullah, was rescued by Filipino troops a day earlier and is now in a "stable" condition with gunshot wounds at a military hospital, Besana told AFP.
"The island had been blockaded for the past 41 days. They (kidnappers) probably thought they could slip past us by swimming," he added.
Three of at least seven kidnappers who were with the hostages were killed in the operations, he said.
The military got wind of the hostages' location in late February and ordered the small civilian population on the island to leave, Besana said.
Abu Sayyaf is a group of self-proclaimed Islamic militants based in the southern Philippines who have engaged in bombings as well as kidnappings of Western tourists and missionaries for ransom since the early 1990s.
In recent years the group has also preyed on cargo ships, tugboats and fishing vessels in poorly policed waters of the region near the sea borders with Malaysia and Indonesia.

On May 27, 1768, Cook, then just a Royal Naval lieutenant, took command of HM bark Endeavour. Its voyage of exploration to the Pacific would last almost three years, record thousands of miles of uncharted lands and seas--including New Zealand, the east coast of Australia and many Pacific islands--and test all Cook's skills as a navigator, seaman and leader. Cook's three voyages were among the first to take civilian scientists, notably Sir Joseph Banks, and they would reveal to European eyes the lands, peoples, flora and fauna of the Pacific as never before, heralding a period of great change for the region. His voyages would also set new standards for scientific enquiry and exploration.
But while the figure of Cook understandably dominates the story of 18th-century Pacific exploration, his fame has often shadowed those who followed him on many voyages of science and exploration into the Pacific, depriving these explorers of the greater attention they deserve. Correcting this imbalance, Pacific Encounters reveals the European voyages that continued Cook's work not only of charting but also starting to exploit and control the Pacific. These voyages, by William Bligh, George Vancouver, Matthew Flinders, Malaspina, Lap rouse and Arthur Phillip, span a period that saw Britain becoming the world's leading maritime power, a situation well in place by the time that Charles Darwin's voyage in Fitzroy's Beagle laid the basis of even greater understanding

Retrieved Text: EVERETT, Wash. - Police in Washington state say new DNA technology led them to a suspect in the murders of a young Victoria-area couple more than three decades ago.
Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18, and her boyfriend Jay Cook, 20, were found dead near Seattle in November 1987.
Police in Snohomish County, Wash., said Friday they arrested William Earl Talbott, 55, from the Seattle-Tacoma area and he has been booked on one count of first-degree murder in the death of Van Cuylenborg.
Officers said they expect to charge the man with Cook's murder once the investigation into additional evidence is finished.
The high school sweethearts were on their way to Seattle by ferry to pick up furnace parts for Cook's father when they disappeared. Their bodies were found in separate locations outside the city days later.
Skagit County Sheriff Will Reichardt said the work detectives did in 1987 documenting the case and storing evidence led them to the arrest.
"It's been 31 years since this horrific crime took place, today we are one step closer for justice for Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg," he told a news conference.
Talbott was expected to appear for a first court appearance in the Skagit County justice centre on Friday.
Police said DNA collected at the scene of Van Cuylenborg's murder was used to identify Talbott's ancestors, which then led them to him. Officers say once genealogists made the connection, police acquired a DNA sample from a cup Talbott had used.
Genetic genealogist CeCe Moore, who worked on the case alongside Virginia-based genetics company Parabon NanoLabs, said she built

It breeds in burrows on forested ridges and steep slopes, and ranges in pelagic waters around New Zealand, and in much of the tropical and eastern Pacific Ocean. The population of this species is estimated at 670,000 individuals. Although it had greatly declined in the past because of depredation by rats and cats while nesting, predator control and eradication programs have helped to stabilize the large nesting population on Little Barrier Island. Because this species is still potentially threatened by introduced predators and climate change, it has a conservation rating of Vulnerable.

Cook's Petrel was formerly more numerous than today. Numbers were affected by predation by introduced mammals and Wekas. Populations have started to recover as rats and cats and other introduced wildlife are removed from breeding islands.

Rather than subjecting the participants to "normal" pain, the authors used a trick known as the thermal grill illusion. The thermal grill illusion is not the latest in BBQ technology, but an unusual – and well validated – phantom pain effect.
When the skin is subjected to an alternating pattern of harmless coldness followed by heat, it creates a sensation of "burning coldness", but does no damage to the skin. It is something akin to the burning sensation felt by anyone placing cold hands under warm water after a snowball fight.
The researchers applied hot and cold sensations to the ring, middle and index fingers to create phantom pain sensations in volunteers. The phantom pain reduced in some people when they crossed their fingers.
This artificial phantom set-up means the findings probably don't apply to most real-life experiences of pain. Would a woman crossing her fingers during childbirth feel some benefit, or would someone who has just hit their thumb with a hammer? Probably not.
We shouldn't get too hung up on the crossed finger idea, though. The concept behind it is more interesting. The study tentatively showed that pain might be influenced by how our bodies are organised in space and relative inputs from different parts of your body.

Lemon juice is filled with Vitamin C and contains skin lightening properties, which is a great recipe for removing those dark under eye circles. So here is what you do: Take a cotton ball and squeeze lemon juice on it. Apply it around the contours of your eyes. Let it sit there for roughly ten minutes and then rinse off.

For a cyclist out hammering in the sun, five beats is the difference between cruising and crossing his or her lactate threshold. And on summer days when heart rate is already elevated by the heat and humidity, keeping a lower heart can ensure that an easy spin provides necessary recovery.
The study observed eight volunteers on indoor trainers working at 50 percent of their aerobic capacity under a heat light while consuming either cold, warm, or hot water. The test ran for 90 minutes, with three water breaks during the workout and one at the end. Skin temperature was also measured, but only a small difference between the cold and hot water groups was found. The big change researchers was that the hot water group averaged 129 beats per minute, while the cold group was at 124.

Speaking to NBC News on Monday, Zarutskie said she had heard from locals that swimming with nurse sharks was risk free. “My boyfriend’s family was freaking out when I went to swim with the sharks and I was like, ‘It’s fine,’” Zarutskie said. She jumped into the water on her own, without any sort of tour guide.
The University of Miami student visited a local clinic following the incident, but decided to fly back to Florida the next day after learning shark bites carry a high risk of infection. “[The doctors] now believe that I still have pieces of the shark teeth in my arm and I will forever have a scar,” she said, slightly concerned for her modeling career.
Earlier this month, a woman on vacation in Dugong Bay, Australia, experienced a similar ordeal with a tawny nurse shark. While feeding

Although she was not invited, the evil fairy appeared there and stood before the little one’s cradle, invoking a curse, saying that on her 16th birthday the girl would prick her finger on a spinning wheel spindle and die.
The curse was heard by a good fairy, who performed an enchantment to avoid the terrible vexation. The enchantment was that, instead of dying, she would sleep for 100 years and only be woken by the kiss of a young prince.
As the years passed, the girl grew into the most beautiful young woman in the kingdom, and the king ordered that all spinning wheels be burned so that she would not prick her finger. On her 16th birthday, the girl went to a place in the kingdom thought to be uninhabited, and there she found a woman spinning yarn who offered to show her how it was done.
It was in this moment that the girl pricked her finger and fell to the floor. No doctor or wizard could wake her.

Johannesburg – A Kagiso woman has been charged with murder after her husband was found unconscious and unresponsive in a bathtub filled with hot water. The man, whose entire body was badly burnt, clung to life for three days.
Police initially opened an inquest case but began suspecting foul play when they took a closer look at the evidence. The wife, Lungile Ntuli, was arrested on Wednesday, more than a month after her husband’s death.
Ntuli appeared at the Kagiso Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
Speaking to The Star, Kagiso police spokesperson Warrant Officer Solomon Sibiya said the woman told them that on October 3 she left the house to go grocery shopping at around 11 am. According to Ntuli, her husband told her that he was planning to take a bath while she was away.
Sibiya said Ntuli told police she arrived home around 4 pm and was startled to see water seeping from under the kitchen door. Ntuli allegedly opened the door, shouting her husband’s name and following the watery trail to the bathroom.
“She said when she arrived there, the taps were closed but her husband was inside the bathtub and that it looked like he had been burnt by boiling water. She said she ran outside and screamed for help. Neighbours responded and found the husband inside the bath with burn injuries.

It wasn't how it was supposed to happen, but it was still perfect.
"This was a blessing. For all the negative stuff that goes on over here, around here, this was truly a blessing," said Donald Robinson.
Robinson captured video of the moments right after the birth of a baby in the 5200-block of South Green Street. The mother lay on her back on the cold concrete sidewalk, her baby boy in the warm embrace of strangers.
"Oh, they ran out their houses. That's what we do on this block. We are a family over here," Robinson said.
Robinson said he was driving past the intersection of West 52nd Street and South Green Street when he encountered the woman, a complete stranger, lying on the ground and screaming in pain. Neighbor Jasmine Williams came running out to help just in time for the woman to give birth.
"And the baby came on out. And all I was thinking was, 'Cover him up.' That's why I ran to my trunk to get some coats and stuff," he said. "I ran, and I don't do no running. I ran to my car."

Some of the players, including my son, played hard until the final whistle blew. Others, however, gave up the game when the other team began to dominate. Some even demonstrated a downright negative attitude, fouling out of frustration.
It was interesting to see this mixture of distinct attitudes among the players in response to their situation, in part because I witness the same attitudes among job seekers facing tough searches.
These people are a pleasure to assist. They wear a smile on their face, despite how they’re feeling inside. Even when they don’t hear back from an employer after spending hours on an application — even when they make it through three rounds of interviews only to lose to someone who is a “better fit” — they trudge on.
When he finally landed a job, I asked him how he had felt during his search. Not surprisingly, he told me there were times when he felt despair and wondered if he would ever get a gig. And yet, he never gave up.
He is so grateful for the services I and others offered him at the career center that he speaks to our networking group regularly. He also lets us know when there are openings at the company for which he works.
It shows on their face. They say they’ll never land a position. They lose sight of the bigger picture. Like my son’s teammates, they walk through their job search rather than run.

#1: As is the case with so many issues in parenting, we do well to begin with a gut check. “How am I doing with managing my own anger?” While hypocrisy is an upgrade over disengagement, our credibility is enhanced when we walk our talk. Moreover, if I’m losing it with some regularity, I could be significantly contributing to my child’s problem with anger control.
#2: Also like so many issues in parenting, proactive strategies usually work better than reactive ones. We all lose IQ points when we’re angry (i.e., the more primitive parts of the brain take over), so if I wait until my kid has lost it to do my interventions, my odds of success are not great, and I may end up loosing it as well. I do better if I think ahead and imagine which situations could be challenging and prepare my child (and me) with a plan.
#3: Anxiety and anger are incompatible with a relaxed body. The first step to doing this is to belly breathe (instead of chest breathe), comfortably but deeply, both in and out. With anger and anxiety, the breath rises up and becomes shallow. With peace and relaxation, the breath drops and becomes deeper. The next thing is to relax all of the muscles.

How tragic indeed that this angry man’s rejection to the Prophet’s advice has been recorded for all times. Instead of heeding the advice, the man’s anger overcame him.
Remembering Allah helps us to monitor our speech and our actions as well, since so often the first lowly instinct is to speak ill, to curse, or to raise one’s hands in retaliation. The reminder to turn to Allah at the onset of anger in reality reconnects us with Allah at a moment when it seems we are being overpowered by Satan’s temptations to anger.
When you feel the onset of anger, in addition to seeking refuge in Allah from Satan, you should shift your posture so that you attempt to regain some sense of control of yourself and regain your composure.
It is reported by Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “If any of you gets angry and is standing, let him sit down, [so his anger will go away;] if it does not go away, let him lie down’” (Abu Dawud).
By focusing on yourself and your inner thoughts enough to change your posture and position, you prevent yourself from saying or doing anything rash in a fit of anger. There are positive physiological effects as well from changing your position, all of which lend to a more calm state of mind and body.
As youth and young adults, you must practice the art of self-restraint.

An unpleasant emotion, anger triggers the release of adrenaline, increases heart rate, and causes sweating, blushing, and sometimes “the crazy eyes.” But while unwholesome, the emotion or feeling of anger keeps our needs met, our boundaries uncrossed, and our interests protected.
People who cannot summon or use anger judiciously are destined to become doormats, inmates, or just plain miserable people. So this article really isn’t about how to get rid of anger, but how to manage anger in a healthy manner.
Anger will get the best of you from time to time—that’s just being human. But if you’re often suffering regret after mindlessly running your mouth, if your temper is harming your relationships and the people around you, then you’re a great candidate for anger management. Of course, if anger has ever led to violence or arrest, well, then you should certainly seek treatment. Your local hospital or department of health are great places to find out what is available in your area. They’ll be able to hook you up with a solid doctor too.
Express, don’t repress. Many people repress anger. This can lead to massive eruptions of anger and rage, or prolonged periods of seething, stewing misery. When you feel yourself getting angry, regain your composure before addressing the person you’re angry with.

Nine Inch Nails made a dramatic entrance Sunday night at The Q. "Pinion" announced the arrival of five silhouettes enveloped in theatrical fog.
During "Love Is Not Enough," frontman Reznor howled: "I've gone all this [expletive] way / To wind up . . . back at the start!" Truer words were never uttered by an industrial-rock icon who launched his career in Cleveland in the 1980s.
"Lots of memories for me here - some good, some not so good," Reznor wrote in a pre-gig post on NIN's Web site.
The concert began with the band behind a translucent veil, which promptly was raised for a seething "Wish."
In short order came "Terrible Lie," "March of the Pigs" and "The Wretched," with one ditty darker than the next. You could imagine Darth Vader seriously digging this stuff if he had an iPod built into his helmet.
The sonic blitzkrieg was complemented by a brilliantly conceptualized light show - pale whites and dirty yellows at first, with more colors creeping into the palette later.
By the time Reznor, guitarist Aaron North, keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, bassist Jeordie White and drummer Alex Carapetis got a cyber-funk groove on for the lustful "Closer," they were bathed in a bordello-red afterglow.
The stage veil came down again for "Eraser" and "Right Where It Belongs," doubling as a screen for images of bacteria, insect close-ups, rabbit X-rays and other ninth-grade biology outtakes.

Retrieved Text: Many physical symptoms signal that there are emotional, mental or spiritual imbalances. Stuffed down emotions, such as anger, grief, hopelessness, sadness and fear, especially when repressed for a long time, take a toll on the body. For example, fear affects the stomach and anger heavily impacts the liver.
Even when we are told to keep our emotions in check, repressing or suppressing what we feel is not a smart approach to, for example, anger management. If we want to live in harmony with ourselves and others, we need to find a way to feel our emotions and let them flow through us, while expressing them appropriately, without offending or hurting others.
Psychosomatic studies have determined the link between our feelings and the body’s major organs. When we live in anger and resentment, the liver produces an excessive amount of bile. Because this is something the organ would not produce in its natural state, the surplus bile causes acidity in the stomach; thus, we start experiencing headaches and an overall state of depletion and toxicity. The liver is the body’s second largest organ, and it regulates the digestive system, our metabolism and the body’s capacity to detox. The liver stores essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals, produces vital protein elements of blood plasma and sustains the immune system.
As the liver begins to malfunction due to a prolonged state of anger, the entire body struggles to maintain its essential functions. To regain a natural state of health, we can do a liver cleanse and an emotional cleanse at the same time.

I started coughing and sneezing before I could finish my breath. After a moment I regained my composure and when back for a more reasonable whiff.

The cucumber and lime are definitely the predominant flavors in this beer when its drank. After swallowed however the habenero takes hold and pokes the back of the tongue with its spiciness, followed up by a burst of fresh cucumber.

And this time around, it's even better, allowing for nostalgia since nothing has changed about the show. (If only they'd bring back Man Oh Man).
The thing is, I've always secretly fancied the idea of being a Gladiator. Once you've regained your composure after falling off your chair laughing, the idea isn't as far fetched as it might sound. For a start, everything on the Gladiators set is padded, which is more, regretfully, than you can say for the real world. There could be a sort of "Gladiators Lite" for the wet, weak and weedy, like me. The challenges could be based around modern difficulties for pasty chubby office workers...first to learn to cut corners using a new database, most pints drunk at lunctime, most tourists elbowed on the way out of the train.

Here’s a very simple tip for saving water that I never did until it was pointed out to me: when filling the tub for a bath, close the drain before turning on the water. I find that most people adjust the water running out of the faucet to the temperature that they want it to be before closing the drain. You can save water by closing it immediately and realizing that the small amount of freezing cold water that comes out of the faucet when you start it will be completely offset by the warm water your run afterward resulting in perfect temperature bath water with less wasted water.
Along those same lines, when filling a pot to boil on the stove, unless the recipe absolute demands it, don’t wait for the water to get hot before putting it in the pot, just fill with whatever comes out of the tap. Put a lid on the pot while you are bringing the water to boil and you will never notice the time difference from starting with warm water or cold water.
Bathe the children together – once my infant was able to sit up on his own, I actually used his big sister – then 5 – in stead of an infant chair or bathtub. I plopped them in the tub together and she helped me out by being another set of eyes and hands keeping him safe in the tub!

What about trying to turn the water on, pick up your child and put soap on their hands all at the same time? Does that sound like an everyday occurrence? This nifty device solves that problem.
Note: I received the faucet extender at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.
I love the faucet extender and it is perfect for the kiddos. I admit I was skeptical about how this would attach to the faucet and once attached would it even work for the kids. I was shocked how easy it was to attach to the faucet. In a matter of seconds the extender is installed and ready to use. No tools needed, just slide it onto the faucet where it fits snuggly. Once attached to the faucet it would not be easy for a kid to remove it without an adult helping them.
I love that water does come out in a regular flow just in an extended manner. The curve in the extender really helps to control where the water is dispersed. The water does not come flying out at the kids but it flows in a downward yet angled motion that helps to reach little fingers.
What is cool about the design is that smaller children can feel independent when washing their hands. The great part is that parents still control the knobs

What are the ways you use to save water? I'm looking for as many different ways to save on our bill as possible Thanks!
Oh, all the usual mthods that you can get from your water company's website, probably. Use the dishwasher and washing machine only when it's full. Take showers instead of baths, and run the water in the shower to dampen and rinse your hair and body but leave it off when soaping it up, conditioning hair and shaving. If you can stand it, use the old water-saving toilet adage "if it's brown, flush it down...if it's yellow, let it mellow!"
Get low-flow faucets and spigots on everything, have drip irrigation for landscaping (or better yet, xeriscape so your yard can survive on the natural rainflow anyway), and have low-flow toilets (if they are old, just put a wrapped brick in the tank to take up some of the space for water). Have a dishpan of soapy water in or near your sink so you can drop used dishes into it and let them soak before putting them into the dishwasher, which saves the water you would normally use rinsing each item before putting it into the dishwasher.

Among the best dressed on Sunday night’s most anticipated red carpet event, were a few of our Men’s Health Cover guys. Their tuxes took on added personality with velvet being one of the biggest trends. Here’s how these stylish men represented the Men’s Health HQ.
For Aquaman’s first Oscars appearance, he took a bold approach to the award season’s more formal affair. Jason wore a pale pink velvet suit by Fendi with a matching hair accessory, a fashion moment we won’t forget for years to come.
Gone are the days when we were told not to wear navy and black together. The Creed II star stood out in a sea of classic tuxedos, donning a midnight blue velvet blazer, black pants, and polished evening shoes. His was a look for the books.
The leading man took crisp and classic to a whole new level, the A Star Is Born actor Bradley Cooper looked like Hollywood royalty in a traditionally tailored suit by Tom Ford.
Captain America was only there to present an award, but his appearance alone deserved an Oscar for Most Impeccable Tailoring. Chris wore a teal blue velvet blazer which fitted him like a glove. A firm favourite on many best dressed lists this year.

Cufflinks are usually related to the wearer’s profession, passion and even humor.

In addition to trick-or-treating, one of the activities that was took place at the soiree was dancing, in which the world was gifted with Barack and Michelle Obama dancing to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”…and probably forever embarrassing their two daughters, Sasha and Malia.

Streetwear — for lack of a better term — was essentially outlawed for players showing up to games or practices. Baggy clothes were outlawed, as were ball caps, headphones and gaudy jewelry. The new rules were almost immediately met with skepticism and protest from players — and with good reason. The guidelines seemed rife with racial undertones. In Stephen Jackson eyes — no stranger to controversy, himself — the league was trying to avoid becoming “too hip-hop”.
Eventually, though, players embraced the dress code and made it their own, and have become increasingly involved in fashion over the last decade or so. NBA players have always been inextricably linked to sneaker culture, but the dress code unwittingly forced players to take a broader interest in contemporary fashion. LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Russell Westbrook are frequent front-row attendees at marquee fashion shows — and those are the “old heads”. There was a time when rookies came into the league in comically oversized suits and cringeworthy outfits, but, now, the kids are alright. With so many fashion-forward players, it begs the question: Who’s the best at getting fits — not shots — off?
Amar'e Stoudemire's famous 4-button suit/coat (left), Allen Iverson's on and off court site was often at odds witih the NBA's top brass and was part of the reason a dress code was brought in.

The rise of the modern trend of "dress casual" [almost an oxymoron] gives rise to that age old question; why do we dress up?
The history of Western dress culture is one rich with trends of formal dress codes and etiquettes of style so intricate and precise, that to the modern un-refined eye, they look absurd. The stories of sumptuary laws, red heels and regimental lace, makes the masters of Europe look like jealous fops, not dignified rulers.
Yet today, living in the cultural void that we do, where to see a man in a nice suit puts him in the upper echelons of style, and sometimes into over dressed category eliciting questions such as "what are you all dressed up for", when less than 50 years ago, that style was de rigeur.

Abdel Amine Elkhezzani, 37, was walking from West 46th Street to West 47th Street around 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 23 dressed as a marijuana plant, when he was “harangued, harassed handcuffed and arrested, then assaulted and thrown to the ground” by police, according to a lawsuit filed against the city and the Times Square Alliance in Manhattan Supreme Court Friday.
The costumed character, who suffered a cut to his forehead during the incident, was “bleeding and in pain,” but was taken to the Midtown North Precinct to get photographed and fingerprinted before being taken to Mount Sinai West for treatment, the suit says.
After his stop at the hospital, Elkhezzani claims he was taken to central booking, but the department wouldn’t accept him because of his “physical complaints."
He was ultimately held in a central booking area reserved for “special cases” until 11 p.m. the next day and “maliciously prosecuted” after that, the suit says.

We ask: Does formal clothing display appropriate respect for God? What attire is appropriate to wear in the presence of God.
Advocates of wearing jeans emphasize what Jesus and His disciples wore during His time here on earth. Of course, jeans hadn’t been invented, but most of the disciples came from the jeans strata of society. (Matthew, Zacchaeus, and Nicodemus would have been exceptions.) We have every reason to believe that Jesus dressed appropriately for the audiences he spent most of His time with; a Son of Man who had nowhere to lay His head was rather unlikely to wear upper-class or royal robes. Some say it is appropriate to dress as Jesus did when reaching the lost and training His disciples—and as His followers did in His presence.
Meanwhile, suit advocates emphasize that that Jesus is now glorified. They would advocate that formal clothes are far more appropriate to honor Jesus as He is now than casual clothing.
This might surprise anyone who knows the extent to which I’m a fan of traditional quartets (and matching suits), but I’m not entirely convinced by the second position.

This flat tire repair system is as simple as pushing a button. I was able to fix my flat in 7 minutes in snowy weather. I was sold. It was safe, easy and fast. Best of all, the Slime product, unlike others, is one that is NOT flammable and can be rinsed out with water by a tire tech. Now everyone’s happy.
Sure it’s best to replace the flat tire with a spare tire, but the Saftey Spair was great because it includes a powerful 12V air compressor that fully inflated the tire. It seals punctures up to 1/4″, includes a safety light in case your flat is at night, the repair is guaranteed for up to 500 miles and it doesn’t harm tire pressure monitoring systems.
This is a perfect gift for any driver and I have one in each of my cars. I found mine at Target for $49, but check your local stores and online for great prices.

Often a long wait, great service though.
Wouldn't you know it, as we're driving around amongst these battlefields and whatnot, we get a flat tire. Who gets a flat tire on vacation? (Raises hand.) But we didn't just get a flat tire. We got the flat tire to end all flat tires. See pic, if it's still here. The flat was caused by a drill bit, nearly six inches long (worn down), and perhaps a quarter inch across. How it got on the road, and then into our tire, I have no idea. Regardless, we stopped at one place and though they had our tire, they were getting ready to go to lunch. Uh, really? You go to lunch rather than fix someone's tire? At least they pointed us elsewhere, and when we got there - er, here - they actually had a loaner car for us, so we could go to lunch. Sweet. Now I hate that we had to pay a relatively expensive price for the tire, but what can you do? The service at least was good, and they got us back on the road fairly quickly. No complaints there.

Most blowouts are caused by too little air pressure, allowing the tire to flex beyond elastic limits until the rubber on the tire loses the bond it has to the internal fabric and steel cord reinforcement. But when it comes to staying safe and getting back on the road as quickly as possible, what should you do?
Flat tire season is May through September due to heat and increased travel.
Flat tires and tire blowouts are estimated to cause more than 78,300 crashes annually.
Total annual sales in car tires: $32.1 billion.
The average driver will experience up to 5 flat tires in their lifetime.
7 tire punctures occur every second in the U.S. – that’s 220 million flat tires annually.
There a few common reasons that your tires could blowout, and they are all related to the main theme of not taking care of your tires for either maintenance and tire rotation, or avoiding putting air in them when pressure gets low. Sometimes, tire blowouts are the cause of other underlying issues.
There are simple and convenient measures you can take to prevent a tire blowout from ever happening. A routine inspection to check for proper pressure, any leaks, or the tread of wear and tear is important.

There are many hazards that can make tires less effective and more of a danger to drivers and passengers. It is not uncommon for a sharp stone, nail, or other pointed piece of debris to puncture a tire. Because flat tires are dangerous to use, it is advised that motorists only drive on them in extreme circumstances, such as when they need to reach safety from a busy highway. It is also important to note that the longer a driver uses a flat tire, the more unlikely it becomes that a tire repair service can be performed. This is because riding on a flat tire for too long can cause irrevocable damage to the tire. As the tire deflates, the wheel will come into closer contact with the ground, potentially damaging the rim. It is important to understand that tire repair is time sensitive. The sooner you are able to bring a lightly to moderately damaged tire in for repair, the more likely it is that the tire can be saved.
Why Should You Have Tire Repair Services Performed at MK Discount Tire Center?
The methods used by our service staff to repair a tire comply with the Rubber Manufacturer’s Association (RMA). The RMA states that a flat tire can be repaired if the puncture is ¼ inch or smaller and if the puncture is located on the tread of a tire. They recommend that the tire repair

While it may seem like your vehicle is just “dead,” in some cases a professional tow truck driver can diagnose your vehicle’s problem more accurately. Knowing what’s really wrong with your vehicle is especially helpful when trying to relay the situation to a mechanic. Depending on the problem, your tow truck driver might even be able to do something about the issue right away, preventing the need for your vehicle to be towed. For example, if your vehicle’s battery is drained, a professional tow truck driver can usually jump start your vehicle for you, as you’ll see below.
One of the most common problems that will prevent a vehicle from starting is a drained battery. Many towing companies in Tyler provide jump starts as well as towing services. Most towing companies supply their drivers with professional jump starters, so customers won’t have to worry about getting cables. Another benefit of jump starters is that they usually allow you to see what level the battery should be charged to, and how much energy is transferred. This information can help you determine if your vehicle needs a new battery or not.
Another service commonly offered by towing companies is changing flat tires. If your vehicle has a functioning spare tire, a professional tow truck driver can quickly change your flat tire out for your spare. However, if you are missing a piece of necessary equipment, such

In 1966, General Motors developed a product called Driver Aid Information and Recruiting (DAIR) system. To test the system, General Motors had Walter Cronkite try it. “As I drove the test car, DAIR navigated for me,” he said, “telling me when to go straight, turn left, turn right, and so on. Speed limits and other traffic signs flashed onto the panel activated by low-power transmitters along the way.” This system was a fusion of proto-GPS and roadside communications, a precursor to GPS. In those days, though, the system did not use any computers. Instead, it used punch cards. Yes, a punch card. To use the DAIR, a driver would insert a punch-coded card into the device, sitting in or near the center console with an on-top-of–the-dashboard display. The holes in the card would translate to mechanical movements in the car itself, directing the driver.
Like today’s GPS devices, DAIR was designed to “assist the driver with his peripheral functions so that he can concentrate his attention on driving.” Additionally, the system could deliver alerts about upcoming road signs or changing speed limits. It could also telephone help if the vehicle got a flat tire or was involved in an accident, much like OnStar does today.
By the late 1960s, though, DAIR was already replaced by more modern route guiding systems. These

Many experts say driver safety begins with tires, as they are the only thing connecting a car to the road. To help teens and young adults stay safe on the roads this summer and all year long, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company and the National Organizations for Youth Safety (NOYS) offer these tire safety tips.
• Check tire condition. Damaged tires can shorten tire life and even cause tire failure. Visually check tires for cuts, cracks, splits, punctures and bulges. If any of these conditions are spotted, or if there are any doubts about the condition of the tires, have them professionally inspected.
• Check tire pressure. Proper air pressure improves fuel consumption and helps prevent uneven wear of tires. It also offers drivers better control, which is important for those with less experience behind the wheel. More than 50 percent of American vehicles have at least one under-inflated tire, according to a Rubber Manufacturers Association survey.
To test pressure, wait until tires are cool — a minimum of three hours after driving. Then, remove the tire’s valve cap and press the top of a tire pressure gauge firmly on the valve stem. A reading will pop up on the gauge. If the reading is lower than the recommended level, add air and check again. Once the recommended pressure is reached, replace the valve cap.

Almost half of all drivers â€” teens or otherwise â€” don’t know how to change a flat or balding tire, according to a study by Flexed. Additionally, 44 percent of teens aren’t familiar with the steps needed to check the tread on their tires, and 32 percent don’t know how to check their tire pressure.
In order for your tires to have a longer shelf life and to prevent accidents, there are several easy ways you can maintain them in both the short and long term. The first and most obvious step is to buy high-quality tires. While your teen may be tempted to go the cheap route, explain to them that buying low-quality, inexpensive tires will likely mean having to replace them more frequently.
Additionally, your teen should know how to check their vehicle’s tire pressure, tire tread and wheel alignment. With this in mind, you may want to buy them a pressure gauge â€” these can be found at most gas stations and car parts stores â€” and show them how to use it.

Truck drivers have some options for changing the tire. They can radio dispatch to find the nearest truck stop and let them know they’re driving there with a flat tire, or they can attempt to change the tire themselves on the side of the road. Semi-trucks have several tires and can allow the truck driver to reach the nearest truck stop without any problems on the road. Truck stops are typically located about every 40 miles or so on the interstate. Therefore, a truck driver won’t have to drive too far to get help with their tires.
If the truck is in a remote area away from the interstate, this might require the driver to change the tire themselves. Most truck drivers should have a tire changing tool, which can break the bead seal that holds the tire in place and prevents the air from escaping. The bead seal is a small groove on the inner edge of the tire which rests on the wheel. When the seal is broken, the tire on the truck can be removed without lifting it. You will also need to remove the nuts. At this point, you would take the damaged tire off the axle and put the spare tire in its place. But

The Continental Tires tested here are no exception: The ride was comfortable, pricing is better and the safety factor can’t be beaten.
But potholed roads are also why run flats get a bad rap: they are known for a rough ride, especially over potholes.

The apex court has asked the filmmakers to screen PM Narendra Modi for the Election Commission of India and let the poll body decide on the ban after watching it. The film's release was blocked by the poll body in view of Lok Sabha Elections 2019. 'PM Narendra Modi' Movie Release Stalled By Election Commission, ECI Says No Political Biopics Will Release During Lok Sabha Polls 2019.
The makers of the film had moved the Supreme Court on Friday after the ECI had blocked the release of all political biopics during General Elections 2019. The ECI, in its ban order, had said, "Biopics are a kind of surrogate promotions."
The movie was supposed to open in theatres on April 11, which again was a release date postponed from April 5. The movie, titled PM Narendra Modi, stars Vivek Oberoi playing the titular role.
Earlier this month, the court had left the decisions on stalling the release of the film to be made for the Central Board of Film Certification and the Election Committee to make. The court had said that the latter should decide whether the film violates the Model Code. Following this, the EC had stalled the film's release and the filmmakers had brought the film back to the apex court. It now remains to be seen as to what the ECI decides after watching the film.

So often movie-based games seem only to exist because every kids' movie and action movie has to have a videogame, and you can tell they were rushed to market because they're barely playable. This one, fortunately, doesn't fit that mold.
There are two ways to play the game: play the story, or go straight for the mini-games. The story starts before the movie does—spending an entire (tutorial) section on preparations for the flight from Madagascar, whereas the movie starts with the plane about to take off. There are quite a few mini-games, all of which (I believe) are incorporated into the game and also available from an "arcade" selection on the game's main menu. The story game is single-player (with multiple saved games available, so several people can play separately), and includes a lot of basic platforming and puzzle-solving, but also some very creative bits involving the movie's main characters—from Marty the zebra having to kick suitcases into cargo containers to Melman the giraffe rolling a spherical boulder back and forth to squash scorpions and knock other boulders to cover steam vents. The penguins are handled very well, with a lot of derring-do to find things to repair the plane—I was laughing at both the game and the cut scenes.

The movie is the true story of former Planned Parenthood director Abby Johnson, who later became pro-life. The film ended the weekend at number 5 behind high budget Dumbo, Us, Captain Marvel and Five Feet Apart. It actually outperformed Captain Marvel in per-theater revenue.
Unplanned has had a hard go at even being shown in theaters. With PG-13 content, the film received an R rating because of a computer generated image of a sonogram portraying an abortion.
Over the weekend, Twitter was forced to reactivate the account for the film after it was censored from tweeting out about the film’s success. In addition, ads were blocked from being run on the networks Lifetime, HGTV and the Hallmark Channel. Even the radio network KLOVE banned ads until www.metrovoicenews.com ran a story announcing the action and KLOVE listeners responded by bombarding the KLOVE Facebook page and corporate switchboard with messages supporting the film.
But those actions can’t stop a good movie. Reviews from Christian movie critics have been strong as well as those of moviegoers.
Strong turnout for movies and high per-screen revenue are what keep movies in theaters. Unplanned’s success is hoped by the those in the pro-life community to continue to grow to reach those who are undecided about the issue and young people who are bombarded with pro-abortion messages in mass media and social media.

In 1925, the Terminal was renamed the Metro, after a new and much larger Terminal Theatre opened across the street at 3315 W. Lawrence Avenue.
The theater was noteworthy because it was only one of a couple of movie houses in Chicago designed with “reverse auditoriums”, where the audience entered at the screen side of the auditorium, facing the rear wall of the auditorium.

Point of view is the relationship between the photographer and the bird (or subject). Point of view is important because getting the best angle for the bird impacts the story your image tells. If you want the viewer of the image to instantly connect with the bird, take an image at eye level with the bird looking straight into the lens. The viewer will connect with the bird; there will be an emotional response and the viewer will “like” the image.
There are various ways to situate yourself in relation to your subject. Below, I offer insights into how to photograph birds.
If we’re standing up and shooting down on birds, the overall story of the image might be that we’re superior or above them. When a movie director wants to make a character seem weak, they shoot from above; if the director wants to make a character seem strong, they shoot from below, looking up at the actor. Shooting eye level doesn’t add an element of superiority or weakness – it’s neutral.
In this image of a Horned Grebe, I had my tripod fully extended and I was standing up on a dock that was a couple of feet above the bird, so I had about eight feet of height from the camera to the bird. When I look at the image, I don’t learn that much about the bird, and I don’t connect with it.

Last year marked a new chapter in cinema history, as Samsung’s world-first Cinema LED screen was unveiled, ushering in the next generation of movie theater technology. The sensation of watching a movie on the backlit Cinema LED screen – with its High Dynamic Range (HDR) picture quality and infinite contrast ratio – is unlike anything experienced before and the screen has been installed in different cinemas around the world.
Now, with increasing interest in the technology from movie experts and enthusiasts, Samsung has announced the launch of Samsung Onyx Cinema LED, a comprehensive cinema screen and sound solution for movie theaters.
Inspired by the gemstone of the same name, the Samsung Onyx brand is an allusion to the Cinema LED screen’s true black colors, offering the audience a detail-rich and vivid cinema experience. Samsung Onyx invites movie-goers to experience a next-level viewing environment with the comprehensive solutions, Onyx VIEW, Onyx 3D and Onyx SOUND. As Samsung Onyx is unaffected by ambient light, Onyx VIEW upholds consistent and distortion-free picture quality that keeps audiences engaged and furthers realism. Featuring high brightness and picture quality, Onyx 3D takes realism to the screen and offers an immersive 3D experience. With support from JBL by Harman Professional’s sculpted surround sound system, Onyx SOUND expands the audio sweet spot within a given theater.

The book carries a powerful story within it, anyone who has read it knows that. Though fictional, much of what lives on those pages pertains to heartbreaking true stories that residential school survivors in Canada have lived through.
Also, to the racism that still lives and breathes in our society. As for the optimistic view that racism is almost a thing of the past, let’s not kid ourselves.
We’re still handling it like a hot potato, which is why Richard Wagamese’s books and others like it are needed. Moreover, they are vital.

I’d definitely recommend it to others. My brother told me to see it in theaters, and he was absolutely right. It’s meant for the big screen and 3D. We’re still about 1 year away from that kind of 3D in the home.
In my area I had a choice between RealD 3D, Dolby 3D (sometimes called Digital 3D) and regular 2D. The closest IMAX theaters are 3 hours away, and although I have been to the one in Kansas City, it wasn’t solely to see a move (The Dark Knight). I did some digging to see which 3D is best. As usual, there wasn’t an obvious answer. From what I found, IMAX 3D is the most immersive. The drawbacks of it are that because it is so immersive it can cause fatigue and headaches because of the length of the movie. I think I still would’ve gone for it if it was in Wichita.

Even mine arrived DOA, but I managed to get a replacement driver board. So for now, it is working just fine.
Anyway, I read on this forum somewhere that it is brighter than a car's headlights, so I thought I would test it the same way. I simply drove along and hung the torch out the driver's window as I was going along. Not very scientific, but a reasonable test, I thought.
It surprised me - the torch is FAR brighter on low beam than both of my car headlights put together. In fact, when you turn the torch off, the car's lights seem rather sad.They're also very yellow, which you don't seem to notice normally.
On high beam, the lights are about the same. Pretty much the same coverage, but again the SR3800 is a lot whiter, so it stands out a lot better. I think the high beam on the car has a wider spread, which is the main differnce.
Anyway - a good test. If my headlights ever go, I could very happily drive home using just the torch!
I did the exact same thing with mine. That is what got me interested in warm white and neutral tints. When i turned off the skyray and turned the headlights on I saw how good the natural subjects looked with a warmer tint.

Answer:- According to theory of relativity, it doesn't matter whether you are travelling in the car or observing the car from a distance, you will observe the light from the headlights travelling at same speed. Thus, an observer inside the car travelling near the speed of light will observe the head lights functioning normally, and will be able to see everything ahead of the car, whereas the observer standing at a distance will observe the car and light from headlights travelling at same speed, so he/she will observe that car's headlights are useless for the car driver as the light from them is not illuminating anything ahead of the car.

You might not think much about your car's headlights until they burn out or appear less bright as your car gets older, but as Consumer Reports explains, headlights are an important safety feature that needs maintenance just like the rest of your car.
Of all of the tests that Consumer Reports perform at its auto test track in Connecticut, this one might be the most unusual.
CR tests the headlights, analyzing things like brightness indoors and how well they light the road ahead on moonless nights.
"We're looking for things like how do the low beams and high beams give you visibility straight ahead are they bright enough, is the pattern uniform or streaky and will they cause glare to an oncoming driver or someone that you're following?" said Consumer Reports Car Expert, Jennifer Stockburger.
But if your car isn't new, you might have realized your headlights aren't in tip-top shape. Sun and the UV exposure can cause the plastic coating to become clouded or yellowed, giving off far less light that they had when you first bought the car.
"You may find cars are more susceptible to this clouding if you are in an area where there is a lot of sun - a hot state," said Stockburger.
"You have kind of two choices. You can replace the headlight," said Stockburger.

Even though a car's alternator plays a vital role in the operation of the vehicle it is a comparatively simple car component with just a few parts. The alternator keeps the battery charged while also helping to keep electrical accessories, including the lights, going while the car is running. Alternators are efficient at charging the battery at low revolutions per minute. As cars run off a DC current the AC output of the alternator is converted to DC by rectifier diodes.
Problems with the alternator may manifest themselves in a range of symptoms, from slow starts to a completely dead car. As the alternator is connected to other systems within the car a great many car problems can adversely affect the alternator and may cause some difficulties in diagnosing mechanical problems.
If a problem develops with the alternator you may notice the ALT or GEN warning lights on the dashboard. This may begin with a brief flicker of the warning light for a second of two.

Underneath the custom body and chassis is a 350 small block engine sourced from a 1969 Chevrolet Corvette. It comes stamped and legally registered as a 1968 Ford Mustang. Along with the registration, it comes with LED headlights, brake lights, turn signals, and floodlights, all of which are DOT approved. There are also six white LED strobe lights attached to the car. Also illuminated the car's appearance is the live pyrotechnic setup that is installed, which provides a variable length flame. When sitting inside, the driver or Batman impersonator will be greeted with three screens that are connected to three different cameras. There is also the ability for the driver to open up the roof, making it the only replica Tumbler to be able to do so. The roof is comprised of carbon fiber, like the body, and it provides the driver with easy entrance into the cabin. This

I think about it every time I drive past a first-generation CLS, which was very cutting-edge when it came out in 2005, but now looks like the kind of thing an emerging Russian luxury brand would've created during the last days of the Cold War. Seriously: the original CLS has aged so badly that you half expect to see them driving around with stick-on fender vents, missing hubcaps, and huge "SALT LIFE" decals in the back window.
1. They're changing the headlights and front bumper so that people who leased a CLS three years ago can tell their friends they now have "the new one."
2. They're adding that stick-on infotainment screen everyone seems to hate, except for actual Mercedes owners.
3. They're coming out with a base-level, V6-powered CLS400 model in an attempt to increase annual North American sales from 27 units to 36.

However, ever since buying this car, I noticed one thing: the headlights are aimed too far to the left compared to what I was used to with Z-beam and "up sweep" headlight beam patterns. There is no doubt in my mind that this was intentional from the factory in order to meet DOT regulations. In a nutshell, DOT regulations requires sufficient "hotspot" luminance to ideally light up overhead road signs but also limit upwards luminance in the upper right side of the lighting area to limit excessive driver side mirror reflective glare of other cars.
The headlights are marked "DOT VOR", meaning you aim using the right side of the beam pattern's horizontal cut off line, with zero degrees of declination. As shown in the diagram above (courtesy/copyright of Mazda), the headlights are aimed to where the flat cut off line meets the down sweep point. The result: the down sweep to the left side horizon cut off line is far to the left.
I want even better lighting performance, safely, however. The European (now UN) standard had tighter glare controls, except for driver side mirror glare of passing cars. This is no problem in many countries because aside from USA, Canada, and Australia, convex driver side mirrors are allowed and in common place. Convex mirrors have a minification factor in what's in view, thus light dazzle is greatly reduced/controlled. Flat driver side mirrors (what is only allowed here) cannot

Clean and clear headlights might make the difference in spotting oncoming hazards.. Just like any part of your car, headlights can lose their luster and performance with age. Here are some ways to return your dim and dirty headlights to the brightness needed for safe winter driving.
Tip: It is important to note that headlights dim through a natural oxidization of the lenses, not just avoidable dirt and grime.
Homemade Remedy: While this solution is a bit more inexpensive, the effectiveness in cleaning your headlights varies from car to car. In order to remove this headlight 'rust' you'll need a gritty solution for polishing.
1: Use dishwashing detergent to wash away the residual dirt from the headlights. Then wipe dry with a towel.
2: Mix baking soda and toothpaste, knead solution thoroughly.
3: Apply paste to headlights with a towel. Rub in circular movements. Apply pressure to grind away oxidized particles.
4: Rinse with water and baking soda.
Store Bought Remedy: There are many products available at auto shops that claim they can brighten headlights and polish lenses. While they vary in price, their effectiveness varies as well. It is a good idea to read product reviews or talk to a service professional before purchasing these products. They provide a solution that you apply to your headlights similar to the homemade method.

Not so great. One way to avoid costly repairs is to focus on proper vehicle maintenance. Here are a couple basic steps to follow that will make your life as a car owner easier.
Perusing your driver manual is perhaps the easiest way to stay informed about your vehicle. All new cars come with this handy booklet, which contains information on all the features and operating parts of your car as well as proper maintenance tips (including the recommended type of oil, tire pressure, and more).
Keeping your car well-maintained isn't necessarily rocket science. There are a few key inspections that you can do yourself to make sure your car is operating in good shape. Checking things like fluid levels (e.g., oil and coolant) and tire pressure can ensure the good condition (and mileage) of your car. Additionally, keeping tabs on the condition of basic equipment such as windshield wipers, tires, and headlights can mean a world of difference when it comes to driver safety. These small inspections take a short amount of time and go a long way towards keeping you safe.

I always considered myself pretty lucky. My baby would eat anything and everything. Getting enough vegetables into her diet wasn’t an issue. Then one day (seemingly overnight) all that changed. My daughter was now an independent toddler and she had her own ideas about what she wanted to eat and even more ideas about what she didn’t. The only thing I could count on her wanting to eat was cheese.
Okay kiddo, we get it….you like dairy, but one cannot live on cheese alone. What about vegetables for heaven’s sake???
I tried all different varieties and prepared them in just about every way under the sun and yet she refused to even put them to her lips. I was about to throw in the towel when I thought of one more idea to try. Below I am sharing with you my own idea, as well as a couple others from friends. Hopefully between the 3, you will find something that works for you and your kid(s)!
A Popsicle (or Smoothie). What’s more toddler friendly than a Popsicle, right? Well much to my relief it actually worked! She lapped them up and even begged for more! Whenever she was hungry she would run and point to the freezer and plead for her beloved “waco’s” (as she called them).

As parents of a smiley, yet very particular baby girl, we are so grateful for the teachers, assistant director and director at WCC - Cedar Creek. Our daughter is small for her age and there was concern over her slow weight gain for the first 6 months of her life. She is very sensitive to who is feeding her, how she is being held, and the temperature of the breast milk. WCC staff have done everything possible to ensure our daughter takes in as much as possible. If she refused her bottle, they would try a different position, a different teacher, etc. It was so comforting as a worried parent, to see how much WCC cared and the lengths they would go to in an effort to help our daughter eat.

Many are going as far as refusing to eat foods that aren't white or are only eating chips, toast or fried food every meal of the day.
Childhood nutritionists are saying they are seeing a spike in the number of frustrated parents and children attending their clinics in a desperate bid to solve the anti-vegetable crisis.
It's the worst they have ever seen it and backs up Australian Bureau of Statistics data that shows only 5 per cent of Australian kids are getting their daily recommended intake of vegetables.
While fruit consumption is on the rise, vegetable consumption has fallen.
Just 5.4 per cent of 2-18-year-olds were meeting the minimum five serves of vegetables a day in 2014-15.
This was down from 5.7 per cent in 2007 and one in four Aussie kids is now considered overweight or obese with childhood obesity on the rise.
Paediatric dietitian and founder of Child Nutrition Miriam Raleigh said "parents are tearing their hair out" over their kids' aversions to vegetables.
She said her client base relating to vegetable aversion was growing and parents were at a loss for what to do.

Now, that little girl didn’t like not liking vegetables. It bothered her that others were enjoying something that she could not. She felt left out…like she was missing some big secret. She especially felt left out in the fall, when her parents and sisters happily ate their roasted acorn squash. They really, really liked the green and golden treat. But try as she might, the little redhead really, really did not.
Years passed. Bit by bit, the little redhead came to love her broccoli and cauliflower and kale with a passion that was quite indecent. The girl who once turned up her nose at anything green (save, oddly enough for lima beans), now thought that roasted brussels sprouts were comfort food. She grew bushels of tomatoes, chard, peppers, and more in her garden. And her vegetable drawers in her fridge were always stocked to overflowing. She was, decidedly, an odd duck.
By the time the redheaded girl had grown into a woman, there were only three vegetables she did not like: beets, spaghetti squash, and acorn squash. She knew there was nothing to be done about the beets or the spaghetti squash. They were horrid things, surely not meant for human consumption. But acorn squash…that gave her pause.

Questions › Category: Feeding Children › My 5 yr old won’t eat fresh fruit, I keep trying different times during and between meals but its a firm no!
It’s really common for young children to refuse to eat certain foods and fruit and vegetables are often top of the list of disliked, or rejected, foods.
In relation to fruit, many children nowadays will eat fruit pouches or pots of fruit but won’t eat fruit in its raw form. In order to increase your child’s willingness to eat fruit, you need to keep offering fruits to her at meal and snack times. Do this over a period of time (weeks and months) and try to offer the fruits in different ways, for example, some of us love tinned peaches (in natural juice) but are less keen on fresh peaches with their skin on. This process of exposure – or repeated offering – can take time, so keep at it but never force or pressure her to eat a food. However, gentle encouragement to pick up, smell, lick or try a food can all help children to be more willing to eat it.
The Child Feeding Guide has developed a free ‘exposure monitor’ to help caregivers keep track of how many times they’ve offered a food and whether it was eaten or refused. If you might find this helpful, you can access it here. There are also lots of other

Most Thai meals consist of meat, rice and vegetables. I know this is a generalization but I am talking about most of the meals. For meals like this you will only be given two utensils, a spoon and a fork. There are also fried noodle dishes that are also eaten with spoon and fork.
The spoon is used to eat with and the fork is basically a shovel used to push food on the spoon. The meat will cut in bite size pieces so there is no need for a knife. Once you get used to it, it is a very easy way of eating.
A knife is only needed if you order something like a steak or have some bread that needs buttering. But, this is not Thai food.

October 1999, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. It was a normal day at the hotel, and in typical fashion, the human resources office was welcoming new job applicants and assisting them to fill out the employment forms. In the office, several tables and chairs were set up to allow the job candidates space to fill in their applications. And on that particular day, the competition for jobs took a serious turn for the worse.
At approximately 11am, a woman walked in to the human resources office with her 4-year old son, as she apparently could not find a babysitter to look after him on that day. She inquired about vacancies in the housekeeping department, and proceeded to sit and fill out an application. A few minutes later, another woman entered the office and applied for the same position.

Mind, Body, Spirit consists of three pictures. The artwork representative of "Mind" shows a woman in a wheelchair wearing a red beret, bright yellow smock, and holding a paintbrush in one hand and a palette in the other. The frame around the seated woman is composed of ovals of one color enclosed in squares of the opposite hue. The woman looks directly at the viewer and sits squarely in the center of her chair and the image. Although enclosed by a thick border, the woman’s feet, and the brushes in her right hand and mouth break out past her boundary.
The depiction of "Body" maintains the same layout template. Here, however, the woman seated in a wheelchair is wearing yellow flippers, a yellow bathing cap on top of which sit goggles, and a red swim outfit. On her lap is a floatation device - a swimming tube - that the woman covers with her folded arms. Four colors comprise the background: blue, green, aquamarine, and purple; these are grouped into shapes evocative of waves in water. As in "Body," the seated figure, although enclosed by thick borders, trespasses beyond; in this picture, her flipper-encased feet challenge the confines of her space.
"Spirit" makes use again of the same template. Here, the background is given perspective and is representational of grass and sky. The blue-green colors are restrained and soothing. The woman meditates in a wheelchair, and is visually balanced with symmetrical positioning of hands, arms, and feet.

The 21-year-old victim first told officers she did not want to get Corey Huffman in trouble. She later said they were arguing and she tried to leave the residence. She said she went to the front porch and Huffman followed her, grabbed her and pulled her inside, placed one hand over her mouth and used the other hand to choke her, according to the Ocala Police Department report.
The woman told the officers that three weeks ago Huffman put a 20-gauge shotgun under her chin and ordered her to shut up. She said she did not call 911 because she is afraid of him, the report states.
Huffman told officers he and the woman argued and said he did pull her inside, but grabbed her shoulder so she would stop screaming. He said he accidentally put his hand around her neck. He denied the incident involving the gun.
Officers found a shotgun and took it. Huffman was arrested for domestic battery by strangulation and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He remained at the Marion County Jail on Thursday, with no bail.
Police said that since children were at the northeast residence at the time of both incidents, the Department of Children and Families was notified.

In April this year, a drunk Tatt went to the woman's home near Toowoomba.
He "violently banged” on her front door and she refused to let him in, Justice Peter Flanagan said on Thursday.
Then he lifted up the garage door and went around to the back door.
"Finally he seemed to calm down and the victim let him in,” Justice Flanagan added.
Then he got angry, swore at the woman, and she asked him to leave.
Justice Flanagan said Tatt grabbed the woman round the throat with his left hand and put his right hand round her nose and mouth.
Struggling to breathe, she bit his hand and he let go.
Tatt then "grabbed the victim around the throat again and squeezed,” the judge said.
Justice Flanagan said a court previously heard choking was a recognised warning sign of future "domestic violence or even homicide”.
Tatt was accused of choking the woman when he was on bail and awaiting trial for other offences that he later pleaded guilty to.
While incarcerated in May, Tatt sent letters to the woman, landing himself in further trouble.
Justice Flanagan said "an unacceptable risk of re-offending” existed with Tatt.

What do your customers hear when placed On-Hold?
An average of 7 out of 10 callers are put On-Hold when contacting a retail store. Is there something you could be telling them about sales, specials, and how much they are appreciated, rather than have them listen to elevator music, dead air, or even worse, a radio station with messages from the competition?
Always remember that a phone is at the ear of the caller. When the caller is placed on hold, you have a captive audience and a unique opportunity to promote and reassure. Our exclusive service provides each customer and potential customer with important information about your location, hours, or even specials and sales that are being offered. The On-Hold promotion tool allows you to talk with the caller, rather than relying on more expensive forms of marketing....all at a fraction of conventional costs.

“Please stay on hold for the next available representative. We’ll be with you momentarily.” Ever found yourself in a situation similar to this video?
We bet you got annoyed quite a few times listening to endless phone beeps and pitches of how important you are to people whom you’re calling. Your customers get annoyed too! Turns out the whole waiting thing has a fancy name to it and can actually be pretty useful for business. It’s called On Hold Marketing, and it does not have to be annoying to your caller!
On Hold Marketing or messaging is a service used by businesses and organizations of all sizes to deliver information to their callers waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. According to studies, 80% of calls are put on hold every time they call a business. And callers wait up to 70% longer when they hear interesting information on a product or service.
An On Hold Marketing System is not just a cost-effective way to promote your business. It’s the most inexpensive targeted marketing solution available.
In Atlantic OnHold, we will always find a right approach to your audience. If a caller has an issue, they would be less receptive to an announcer with a higher or vibrant pitch to their voice. For a younger audience, a deep or commanding vocal style might not be the right choice to captivate your caller. We will record your marketing message in the tone and pace that would be right for your business.

There are two types of transfer methods. Consultative and Blind Transfer.
A CONSULTATIVE Transfer allows you to put the inbound caller on hold while you call the intended end users extension. Once you have made contact with the intended end user (or their voicemail) you can speak with the end user and discuss the next action, which is to patch the call through to the end user, or not.
To patch the inbound caller through to the intended end user, simply press the "transfer" soft key or hang up your phone.
If the intended end user does NOT want to accept the call, they will end the call by hanging up the phone or pressing their "end call" soft key.
This will put the inbound caller on hold on your phone. At this point you can resume the call by pressing the "Resume" soft key, and let the inbound caller know the intended user is not available, or you can transfer the inbound caller using the "Transfer" soft key to another extension, or the intended callers voicemail.
A BLIND transfer, transfers the inbound caller away from your phone to the new extension you have entered immediately, thus completing the transfer.

Whenever we ask companies to gauge their average on hold time or rate of caller abandonment, they will dodge the question or mask their answer with terms like “callers in cue” and “delayed calls” – then quickly change the subject. More often than reality would permit, they'll even indicate, even insist, that they never put anyone on hold.
It’s time to acknowledge the “call center in the room” and embrace on hold time – only then can you transform “waiting” into something proactive, educational, and beneficial for your company.
Because, whether you like it or not, almost every business and call processing system, automated or not, will ultimately have callers on hold.
Some companies go beyond thinking their are no callers on hold to advertise that they don’t have on hold time, and that there will always be a live representative waiting to take your call. Though this is ideal, this promise creates an expectation – and when callers discover that their expectations aren’t met, they are even more frustrated on hold, and caller abandonment increases.
First, it is important to understand that hold time is not indicative of non-responsiveness – most callers understand that major corporations receive thousands of calls a day, even if they groan and complain. It is the silence, the transfers, the unknowing that makes customers antsy.

The announcement follows an investigation by The Daily Caller News Foundation that showed neither the DHS, nor the Office of Government Ethics properly examined major ethics violations related to his fast-tracking of visas for a company run by Hillary Clinton’s brother.
DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday that Mayorkas is leaving the agency a couple months early — before the Obama administration comes to a close and a new administration takes over.
“I am writing to inform you that my last official day as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security will be October 28th,” Mayorkas said in an email obtained by TheDCNF.

Authorities say the 31-year-old woman walked into the park on crutches on June 19 and read a statement about homelessness and mental health issues. Moments later, she set herself on fire. Some bystanders attempted to put the fire out, though Sagal later died from injuries.
Sagal was best known for her horror game “Homesick,” which follows the story of a woman searching for her friends inside the house where her family was murdered. She also made headlines in 2013 when she ran an Indiegogo campaign that was ostensibly for metal poisoning treatment. But, according to Eurogamer, the money was instead used for gender alteration surgery.
Sagal’s friends tell Oregon Live she had physical difficulties and struggled with mental illness for many years. They also said she was the target of a persistent online bullying campaign by Kiwi Farms, which the New Yorker once described as “the web’s biggest community of stalkers” that “specializes in harassing people they perceive as being mentally ill or sexually deviant in some way.” The group allegedly began harassing Sagal on various social media platforms after the Indiegogo campaign.

Most of us like to think that we’re compassionate people – that, given the opportunity, we’d recognize another’s pain and be moved to help. But in the midst of our daily lives, how compassionate are we, really? And is this something we can change about ourselves?
These questions were at the heart of a recent study led by Paul Condon, a graduate student studying social psychology with Dr. David DeSteno at Northeastern University. The experiment offered participants eight weeks of meditation instruction. Meeting for two hours each week, half of the participants were taught techniques to foster mindfulness, and the other half were trained in compassion. A comparison group of people who were also interested in learning meditation received their training after the study was complete.
After eight weeks of instruction, participants took various cognitive tests, believing that the experiment was measuring the effect of meditation on things like attention and memory. However, the real goal was to understand changes in compassionate helping behavior. This is where the experiment got elegantly clever.
The set-up went as follows. When a participant arrived for their cognitive testing at the end of the study, he or she entered a waiting room to find three chairs, two of which were occupied. Unbeknownst to the participant, the two other people in the waiting room were “confederates” – colleagues who were part of the study, but posing as bystanders.

His own case – at a young age, he had developed a kind of hip joint degeneration where the doctors insisted that nothing could be done for him apart from a hip replacement. He would not be able to walk normally without a surgery since the cartilage was all gone as well. He was patched up with plates and screws and could only walk with crutches.
6 months later, this young man could walk normally without crutches. He visited the old doctor who was on his deathbed. When our young man walked in and stood there, an obvious testament to what Dr. Phatak’s homeopathy had achieved, the old doctor just smiled and joined his hands in the old Indian greeting. He passed away the next day.
This young man narrated another incident where a lady had a ping-pong ball sized brain tumour. The homeopath (don’t know who) laughed and guaranteed that he’d make it vanish. And that’s exactly what happened, much to the disbelief of the allopaths.
Such feel-good true stories and wonderful confidence is truly heart-warming.

In 1871 when Edward J.

Amongst the shipment was a long case clock called a Spocken Regulator valued for its high tension balance springs key to Dent’s super accurate timepiece that was destined to become the standard G.M.T and key to the synchronising of the British Empire at the time.
As Dent began work on his clock and sorting through his various shipments he noticed that the crate of the Spocken Regulator had a hole on one side, quite unusual and he feared that his precious springs may have been damaged but upon emptying out its contents everything appeared to be in order. Upon opening the Spocken Regulators front case though Dent’s blood ran cold, at the bottom of the case was a small pile of empty monkey nut shells, Dent had inadvertently imported a Horological nightmare, Pendulum Pandas.

Part of this, I suppose, you have to chalk up to Slovakia's recent independence: since the Czech Republic got to keep the capital city, it also kept all the museums there. So maybe they did go around to Slovak babushkas, asking them to scour their attics for collectables.

Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world.

PC gamers are truly spoilt for choice these days. For all the news about the latest and upcoming consoles from both Sony and Microsoft, there’s still no beating the sheer variety – not to mention performance – that’s available to PC gamers.
Furthermore, NVIDIA’s Pascal cards represent one of the starkest improvements in performance over the previous generation in a while. The GeForce GTX x60 cards have long been a bastion of mainstream performance, so while they offered fairly good value for money, there was a silent acknowledgement that you couldn’t expect too much out of them either. For instance, probably no gaming at resolutions beyond 1080p.
That’s changed now with the GeForce GTX 1060, which quite literally redefines what we think mainstream performance means. With performance more or less on par with the GeForce GTX 980 – one of the previous generation’s flagships – it’s no longer fair to think of mainstream cards as delivering generally mediocre performance.
As is usual, manufacturers have chimed in with their own custom takes on the card. This means more powerful cooling solutions, additional power phases, and factory overclocks, all of which translate into a slight performance edge over the Founders Edition model.

My whites weren't quite at the firm peak stage but others had started to pipe their batter out, so I took the bowl off the mixer and folded the yolks in gently, followed by the flour. We piped the mixture into four discs the size of our cake rings, as well as into ladyfingers. Chef suggested we pipe them close enough so that they were touching, kind of like a fence. Making individual ladyfingers might be more traditional, but it's much more difficult to assemble the cake. After dredging the tops with sugar, into the oven they went. Unfortunately, Chef overbaked some of the trays. Mine came out just right, but quite soft.

After school, Alex would often head to her home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, together they would pass the afternoons cooking and baking, particularly before Shabbat. “She was never a cook who had just one option for [Shabbat] dinner,” or dessert, he says. There was often a cake, dried fruit and nuts and sweets like chocolate chip squares, which Alex likens to blondies speckled with chocolate chips and topped with meringue. Those recipes and experiences “became part of my culinary spirit,” he says.
There was also always a simple three-strand challah. “In the 80s it wasn’t so easy to find challah in the store the way it is today,” he explains. So, Martha made her own. A custom Alex believes she started when she lived in Brookline, a Jewish area outside of Boston. She evolved into an accomplished homebaker, becoming a source of information for Craig Claibourne, the legendary food editor at the New York Times.
For her challah, she would start with three eggs, a third of a cup of this and that. Feeling her way through the recipe, Alex recalls, she would add flour until the dough reached the consistency she was looking for. The bread wasn’t always the same. “Sometimes it would taste almost like a cake,” Alex explains. Still, it always graced the Shabbat table.

When Kish took over cooking the holiday meal, she upgraded the classic side with a decadent coconut custard that offsets the earthy sweetness of the dish. The custard will set as it cools and slices beautifully at room temperature.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut a small slice off skin side of each squash half so they will sit flat while baking. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet.
Drizzle squash with oil, and season with kosher salt; sprinkle evenly with sage. Roast until squash is tender and begins to brown, about 40 minutes. Let squash cool completely, about 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.
Whisk together coconut milk, cream, egg yolks, sugar, pepper, orange zest, and fleur de sel in a large bowl until well combined. Pour coconut mixture evenly into well of each squash. Bake at 300°F until custard begins to set and jiggles slightly like gelatin, about 55 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. (As squash cools, custard will set up further.) Cut squash halves in half; transfer to a platter. Drizzle brown butter over top, and sprinkle with toasted walnuts.

SAN JOSE (KGO) -- Deputies in San Jose said they searched for a stolen car suspect after a high-speed chase ended in a crash on I-680 and McKee Road.
The pursuit began around 3:20 Monday morning after police say they started to pursue a suspect in a stolen two door Honda Civic. Authorities said the car was stolen out of Milpitas. The pursuit went through Tully, King and Capitol Expressway at speed in excess of 80 mph. Deputies used spike strips that shredded a tire of the stolen vehicle. Police say the driver entered I-680 going northbound in the southbound lanes. The car crashed on I-680 near the McKee exit, where the suspect bailed on foot, police said.
A female passenger remained in the car and is being questioned by deputies. Dogs searched thick brush surrounding the highway, but they did not find the man. The suspect is described as a light skinned Hispanic man in his 30s or 40s, 180 pounds, about 5'9", wearing blue jeans, black shirt, red and white shoes and black glasses.

Lawyers say the decisions are the first two cases at the Court of Appeal that deal with the police’s power to search an abandoned vehicle under the Highway Traffic Act.
“It’s really significant in terms of the idea of when the police can seize a vehicle as being abandoned,” says Mark Halfyard, a lawyer with Rusonik O’Connor Robbins Ross Gorham & Angelini LLP, who was not involved in the cases.
Dunkley was arrested after he ran away from the police outside a gas station when they approached him, leaving his car behind. The police searched his car without a warrant and found a handgun as well as a Taser. In his trial, he applied to have the evidence excluded under s. 24 of the Charter.
The trial judge found the police had reasonable grounds to detain Dunkley and to search his car.
The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed.
Hourigan said the police had reasonable suspicion but not the reasonable grounds required. Hourigan added that the search could not be justified under S. 221 of the Highway Traffic Act, as there was no indication that Dunkley had abandoned his car, which was parked in a the gas station parking lot.
“When the officers confronted the appellant, he took off on foot,” he said.
The court allowed Dunkley’s appeal, the evidence was excluded and he was given an acquittal.

It is the first time a curfew order has been given for the illegal dumping of waste.
Magistrates last week handed 41 year-old Wayne Barras a four-month curfew for dumping 15 tonnes of construction waste across four sites in Leeds.
As well as being banned from leaving his home between the hours of 9pm and 7am, Barras also has to wear an electronic tag so police can keep track of his movements.
The prosecution was the result of a year-long investigation by Leeds City Council environmental enforcement officers.
Leeds Council environmental protection member Steve Smith said: "We are delighted that the Magistrates Court has shown that it supports our efforts to crackdown on those who willfully damage the environment by handing out such a tough punishment."
The court heard how Barras was employed by a property developer to dispose of its waste.
However, he didn't have a license to do it legally and instead knowingly dumped it across four sites in the southern area of Leeds.
As well as the curfew order and offender's tag, Barras was ordered to pay £1410.72 costs to Leeds City Council.

Pietermaritzburg (SA): Reliving history, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today retraced Mahatma Gandhi’s train journey in South Africa as he travelled to a railway station where Gandhi was thrown out of a train compartment that proved to be a turning point in his life.
On the second day of his visit to South Africa, Modi boarded a train at Pentrich and travelled to Pietermaritzburg, a distance of around 15 km, paying tribute to Gandhi’s fight against racial discrimination.
On 7 June 1893, while Gandhi was on his way to Pretoria from Durban, a white man objected to his presence in a first-class carriage, and he was ordered to move to the third- class compartment.
Gandhi had a valid first-class ticket and refused to obey the orders following which he was thrown out of the train at Pietermaritzburg station in a winter night.
He had stayed at the station that night in shivering cold and the bitter incident had played a major role in Gandhi’s decision to stay on in South Africa and fight the racial discrimination against Indians there.
The Prime Minister visited the spot where Gandhi was offloaded from the train.
Modi will also visit the Phoenix Settlement, which is very closely associated with Gandhi.
“PM travels from Pentrich Railway Station to Pietermaritzburg. Train resembles the one on which Gandhi ji travelled,” the PMO tweeted.

They agreed that the reunion was to take place the next year in the north of the Netherlands on the Ijsselmeer.
From that moment on, a reunion took place every year. The location alternated between the north and south of the country. The ships that travelled north or south to the reunions tried to form convoys. The winter reunions became events.

In ancient Japan, small communities worked together to maintain rice farms. An obligation existed for each small community to help each other in time of need in order to ensure the survival of the community. So, if one farm needed help in some way the community would work together to help that farm. Later, the farmer being helped would be obligated to help others in the community. From this was developed a strong sense of social obligation to maintain harmony in order to keep balance in social relationships. If someone were to help you, you are obligated to help them in return.

The Bible tells us that some people are gifted or called to the role of evangelist. It is an “office” of the church like pastor, prophet, apostle and teacher as mentioned in Ephesians 4:11. Many of us could name people who have filled this role and in doing so affected the lives of hundreds, thousands or maybe even millions. In modern times, Billy Graham is the most recognized name to have filled the role of evangelist.
One of the dangers of recognizing people who are called or gifted as an evangelist is that we tend to abandon our own responsibility to evangelize the world. I have frequently mentioned that evangelism is not one of my gifted areas. I do fill the role of pastor or teacher, but have never felt like I was an evangelist.

Yuli Edelstein, the speaker of Israel’s legislative body, said last week that he may skip the event if the prime minister will speak at it. In previous years, prerecorded messages from Netanyahu were played at the torch-lighting ceremony.

Many members and followers of ecosurety might have seen our recent pledge to help reform the PRN market published in the CIWM Journal. Over 13 years’ working with producers and re-processors has convinced us there must be a better way to increase transparency in the system.
This year we believe we have a way forward, a new solution for the PRN market that will introduce greater transparency and investment opportunities for producers and re-processors.
We will introduce this during an exclusive launch event in September at the Grand Connaught Rooms, London. The event includes dinner and networking opportunities, and importantly it is free to attend as we believe all stakeholders in the PRN market should have the opportunity to be there.
Our new solution is called Circularety. It will empower obligated producers and re-processors to revolutionise the PRN market, introducing unprecedented levels of transparency and investment opportunities in a giant step towards a circular economy for the waste industry.
After a presentation there will also be an opportunity to network with other producers and re-processors, as well as key influencers and industry commentators.
The free places are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, and we have already received significant interest – so please register soon if you want to be sure of a ticket. To secure your place, please use the link below.

For people who tend to think negatively, social anxiety can be even worse. However, by following an approach based on cognitive behavioral therapy (see below), it may be possible to adopt a slightly more positive outlook.
It has been five years since a 28-year-old man in Fukuoka Prefecture became a civil servant. Although he currently works in an environment where he is able to consult his boss whenever he is unsure of something, at his first workplace he was overburdened with problems he felt obligated to resolve on his own. Unable to take his mind off his troubles, he started feeling anxious and stress built up.
"Whenever I started to change my clothes to get ready for work, I would get pains in my chest. Putting my shoes on and stepping out the front door felt as terrifying as if I were jumping off a roof," he recalls.
Around the end of his first year, he took leave. Although he returned to work, he was unable to do his job again after just a few months.
The man consulted Misuzu Nakashima, a clinical psychologist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy, in December 2014 for workplace counseling. She said, "Unless he can analyze the causes of his stress and find ways to cope, the cycle of leave and work will repeat."

It is normal for both brides and grooms to get cold feet—a feeling of anxiety about the upcoming wedding. Caught up in the tempest of wedding preparations, you may start feeling nervous and uncertain about the event. This is a natural feeling and usually passes away quickly.
However, sometimes cold feet indicate that you may be worried about something seriously wrong in the relationship: your fiancÃ©’s negative behavior, violence, deceit, difference of opinion over major issues etc. Don’t continue with such a wedding just because you’re afraid to cancel it.
Most of the time, getting cold feet is very common before a wedding. The stress of planning the event can often lead to little fears and anxieties.
A wedding is a happy occasion, so avoid getting too stressed about it. Take a break occasionally from wedding activities and spend some time doing yoga or running. Hang out with your friends and family, watch a movie or play games.
Sharing problems often lightens one’s burdens. Speak to a close friend or family member about your fears. Talk to a married person who may be able to share his or her own experience of pre-wedding nerves.
Speaking to your beloved is also a good option. You may find that he or she is going through the same thing. Don’t be afraid of hurting or angering them. Understanding and sharing are an important part of a happy

One of the important rituals, especially in context of the bride, comprises of 'Mehndi' (commonly known as henna). As a part of this ritual, the powder of henna leaves is mixed with water (and many-a-times, oil and lemon juice as well), to form a paste.

Even if you pride yourself on rational thought and consider all of this mumbo-jumbo, it's probably a good idea to heed these superstitions just in case!
It is bad luck for the bride and groom to see each other on the day of the wedding up until the ceremony starts. This idea harks back to the era of arranged marriages where parents would be nervous that the couple might bolt once they got a good look at each other!
The mere sight of a pig or a hare in general or a lizard running across the road will bring bad luck to your marriage. Stay away from zoos, farms and desert landscapes as a preventative measure!
If the groom drops the wedding ring on the ground during the ceremony, matrimonial happiness is doomed. Probably a good idea to keep the ring with the best man or ring bearer until the last minute. Then, when it's time to receive the ring and slip it on the brides finger, you might want to think about coating your fingers with an adhesive spray if you think you'll be extra

In the beginning, I loved helping the bride in any way I could, and I especially loved feeling valued enough to be asked to be involved in such a special day. The first three times brides popped the question to me, I excitedly said, “Yes, yes! A thousand times, yes!” while giddily hopping around. Back then, being asked to be a bridesmaid meant that I got to be up close to the magic of weddings and that the bride cared for and trusted me.
As a result, the effort I threw into those first three weddings was probably the most selfless work I have ever done. It was all about doing whatever I could to make things easier for the bride and groom. I would block out all of my weekends to run errands with the bride.
Most of the brides were very hands-on and Pinterest-obsessed, so we would spend weekend after weekend visiting every corner of Seattle to find the best possible deals without sacrificing the “dream wedding.” This meant that the bridesmaids became mini wedding planners. We would take a weekend to haggle at Pike Place with the flower vendors for our bouquets and boutonnieres. The following weekend, we would travel all over the many districts within Seattle looking for the perfect venue. My favorite weekend was the dress one; we’d city hop, visiting

According to court documents, Carrillo told police he spanked the 2-month old because the infant grew fussy as he watched him in his Pontiac street home. He claims he tripped with the baby in his hands, falling, causing the baby's head hitting the floor causing severe injury.

When we look back, on these times, we learn how hard life can be for people like him, as a baby. Thankfully he grew out of this problem and thrived.
The two children grew up and did well, at School and in life, and Ron got ill, heart trouble in his 40s**, which caused him two serious Open Heart surgeries and lived to be 82 years old and 3 leg surgeries.

The 48-year-old man has two biological children who are not yet 35 years old, the age he designated that they will have access to the trust, so he legally adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend as his daughter, which would entitle her to one third of the assets in the trust.
His civil trial and criminal trial for DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a crash for an accident that left a 23-year-old man dead are both scheduled to begin in March. He could face a lengthy prison term if convicted, and wants to protect the assets in the trust for his children.
The court hearing the lawsuit has ruled that the trust assets cannot be considered part of the man's assets in the event punitive damages are awarded. The family of the accident victim thinks that portion of the trust should be available for the lawsuit since the man effectively has control over that money.
The man's attorney maintains that the adoption is not illegal, and that the only reason he did it was as a safeguard to protect the trust -- which started more than 20 years ago with a $1.5 million investment and grew into the hundreds of millions of dollars -- for his children. A

Hamburger has not been convicted of a doping offence and the DIF subsequently finds it untenable that agreed-upon Olympic selection demands are to be deviated from on the sole basis of suspicions and circumstantial evidence,” said a DIF statement. Hamburger formally met the selection demands by placing sixth at last year’s Worlds in Hamilton, Canada, and was hugely surprised when the DCU decided not to nominate him for an Olympic place earlier this month. “It feels like I’m fighting an enemy I can’t see. I’m defending myself in a case that isn’t a case,” the Acqua e Sapone rider said at the time. Since then, he has encouraged the Danish sporting authorities to test him at any time, and has furthermore provided the relevant parties with a detailed plan of his whereabouts leading up to the Athens Olympics.

Can you believe it?? Hamburger Mary’s is 40 years old! Yes, the very first Hamburger Mary’s was open in 1972 in San Francisco!
Hamburger Mary’s was a success! A bar was added on the one-year anniversary, and soon the owners expanded to add locations in Portland, Hawaii and Seattle. Pretty soon, there were Hamburger Mary’s up and down the West Coast (some had licensing agreements, others were just copy-cats). In 1988, the loosely-knit group of restaurants were molded into a true franchise organization.
Partners Stan Sax and Darren Woolsey opened the original franchised location in Palm Springs, and soon after took over the helm of Hamburger Mary’s International. Under Stan and Darren, Mary headed eastward and franchises opened as far and wide as Fort Lauderdale, Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Washington DC, Phoenix, West Hollywood, Denver Kansas City and Chicago.
Under Stan and Darren, the first efforts were made to come up with common menu items and recipes. But staying true to the spirit of the original Hamburger Mary’s, the new franchisees were given free range to incorporate mismatched dinnerware, colorfully framed artwork (hung in crooked collages), and boldly painted walls. Walking into any Hamburger Mary’s is like walking into Mary’s home, with each location a little unique in its eclectic décor (yet all the same, “very Mary”).
Although the original locations in San Francisco and Hawaii had long closed, by the mid-2000’s Hamburger Mary’s had reached a peak. There were eleven locations nationwide, but many franchisees were

As I was looking around for new printables to illustrate, I made an unfortunate discovery: Just like their namesake cuisine counterparts, all the online hamburger paragraph printables were of poor quality. Cheaply produced clipart illustrations slapped onto Word documents. I decided to mend this problem, by drawing a high-quality hamburger that would actually make your mouth water. Out with the McDonalds, and in with the Long Horn! And now I present to you my creation: Tim’s Printable Hamburger Paragraph Worksheet, sponsored by the kind folks at Dutch Renaissance Press, for your child’s intellectual consumption.
Now you can show you kids and students the layers that make up a strong paragraph. Beginning at the top, we’ve got the topic sentence / top bun. This is the main message of the paragraph. Next we have the supporting sentences, represented on the hamburger by the tasty topping: lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions, bacon (Mmmm….Bacon). Then, to wrap it all up, we conclude with a conclusion sentence that connects the supporting details with the topic sentence, visually shown by the hamburger’s bottom bun.

I left the egg yolk off and they turned out perfectly fine. Without the egg yolk, all you need to do is use vegan margarine instead of the butter, and soy milk instead of regular milk to have a vegan version. Easy!
The rolls were soft like regular hamburger buns but they also had some of the chewy texture of bread. They were delicious and held up well with all of the messy condiments. Dave has to have everything on his burger--mustard, ketchup, vegan mayo, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes--so store bought buns usually disintegrate. This buns were nice and sturdy but also soft and puffy. I'd love to make them again.

In fact, people often filer posts on social media apps like Instagram with the help of emoji search. However, not every smartphone and OS manufacturer uses the same emoji design. They make small modifications to create their very own and unique emoji.
The cheeseburger or hamburger emoji was approved as a part of Unicode 6.0 way back in 2010. However, it was added to the emoji1.0 just two years ago in 2015. Freedom was given to the developers to decide how they want to render their own burger emoji and that is why Microsoft, Google, Apple and even Samsung have its very own customized burger emoji.
A couple of days ago, a simple tweet by Thomas Baekdal regarding Google’s burger emoji created quite a storm on the internet! Thomas questioned the way Google showed the ingredients inside the burger and Sundar Pichai responded that he plans to alter the emoji design soon. Let’s explore what exactly is wrong with Google’s burger emoji.
First of all, you must know the ingredients of a burger- two buns, cheese, meat patty, tomato, and lettuce, and sometimes mayonnaise and ketchup are also used. So, the issue with the Google hamburger is the way these ingredients are placed inside the two buns.

They’re also a great way to keep insects out of the drink at picnics, and to keep unwanted things out of your beer or soda while you’re at the bar or a party. A pack of 10 Linden Sweden Bottle Caps in assorted colors is $6.57 from Amazon; Prime shipping is available.
My understanding is that once opened…..there is no way to “keep the fizz in” unless you re-pressurize the carbonated liquid with carbon-dioxide. Even those pump gadgets will not work because it is pumping in an air mixture containing 21% oxygen.
Jimmy, I wouldn’t think these would be suitable for anything other than keeping your drink covered while you finish it. It might slow down the loss of carbonation, but it’s not going to keep the contents bubbly for days after opening.

Polyethylene caps are very easy to bend by hand. The push on caps found on some milk jugs are made from polyethylene.
Polypropylene caps are very rigid and difficult to bend by hand. Screw on caps are made from polypropylene.

Two different plastics are commonly used for the production of plastic bottles. The thin, transparent plastic bottles used for water, soda, shampoo and some cooking oil bottles are made from polyethylene terephthalate (plastic #1) whereas the harder, more rigid, plastic bottles used for washing detergent and milk jugs are made from high density polyethylene (plastic #2).
When people generally think of recycling, they imagine an item of waste being broken down into its raw material and then that raw material being used to make a new item of the same product. They imagine a closed recycling cycle. However, most plastic recycling in the US does not work like this.

It is even more dangerous when the bottle is kept with leftover sports drink mix. The longer you keep them untouched, the greater the danger they pose to your health. It is essential that you keep them fresh and clean more often than you think you should so you can enjoy your water bottle for more years of use.
Here are some helpful tips you need to consider to keep the grime and the germs off your water holder and the liquids that you drink while on the go.
Wash them after every use. Just as you would want your drinking cup or glass thoroughly cleaned before and after using them, you would never want to drink from a water bottle that you have missed to clean. You can’t be sure what you leave on its lid every time you open the bottle as you ride and drink. If you don’t have soap and water at the moment, even just rinsing the bottle will do.
Wash the bottle with your hands. The easiest way to clean your water bottle is to use your hands to rinse or wash it with soap and water.
Use a bottle brush. It is easier to clean hard to reach parts of the bottle with a long-handled bottle brush. This can remove the sticky residue better and easier than just rinsing the water.

Education is a popular topic in the 2016 presidential election, focusing on urban education. Eastern Michigan University is giving attention to this topic through the new Urban Teacher Pathway Program.
This program takes middle and highs school students from urban neighborhoods who are interested in teaching and creates a pathway to help prepare them for the College of Educations’ curriculum and then places them back into the districts they originate from. This idea came from a pair of town hall style meetings last summer, with teachers from Ypsilanti Community Schools and Detroit Public Schools, where they told Sayler, the dean of Eastern’s College of Education, what they wanted out of teachers and the school districts.
Problems addressed included a lack of teacher retainment. Teachers will come to their home districts to work but they disappear fast because of district conditions or the lure of higher pay in the suburbs and rural communities.
This new program is designed to help “non-traditional” students succeed in the program through a combination of financial aid, an expedited admittance process and social services.
The program will guarantee the students a future interview with the school district they came from.

While most of this attention focuses on students’ mental health needs, it is also essential to explore ways of supporting teachers and school staff who often experience high levels of stress.
Relative to professionals in other sectors, educators experience significantly more stress and suffer more often from mental health problems. In fact, 61 percent of educators reported that their work is “always” or “often” stressful. Failing to address the mental health needs of teachers (concurrent with our focus on student stress and trauma) may affect their ability to address critical needs among students. Teacher wellness has been linked not only to teachers’ physical health, but also to stability in schools and to teaching effectiveness and student achievement. Moreover, teachers’ emotions and stress levels have been found to influence those of students and other teachers. In Child Trends’ preliminary research on creating healthy school environments, students, educators, and policymakers all mentioned teacher wellness as an important factor in the overall health of a school.
Research points to several key sources of stress that can undermine teacher wellness: high-stakes job demands, limited resources and professional autonomy, and negative school climate. Heightened attention to student test scores in recent years has placed teachers under increased scrutiny, as their professional success is measured in large part by student performance on standardized exams. They must also navigate challenging student behavior and complex parent and family needs.

The thing is, there’s nothing wrong with observing lessons, work scrutiny or any of the other practices used to peer inside the black box of teaching quality, the problems stem from how the information gleaned is then used.

And, all too often I see teachers resort to all types of crazy classroom management plans trying to get a handle on student behavior.
Unfortunately, many of these classroom management plans involve elaborate systems of rewards and punishment. For example, writing students names on the board with check marks added next to the name for each inappropriate behavior. Not only is this degrading, but the effectiveness of this classroom management plan is short-lived at best. In fact, often times this classroom management plan can have the exact opposite effect on student behavior.
Likewise, rewarding students for behavior that is expected of them sends the absolutely wrong message. Teachers should not reward a student for acting appropriately in class. Rewarding appropriate behavior is not effective classroom management, it is bribery and the students will come to expect it. Don’t get me wrong, I am not speaking about a pizza party or movie after a week in which the students worked well in class. That type of reward is fine as long as it is unexpected. The type of rewards that are bad are the ones in which the teacher promises upfront that if “you behave today, I will give you a piece of candy.” No, the student should behave in class because that is what’s expected. Little Johnny will not throw his pencil across the room, because it disrupts the learning of the other students and can be dangerous, not because he will get candy!

Specifically their grade-redistribution, a system mirroring that of Scandinavian countries, has come under scrutiny. This bell curve system unfairly redistributes grades, covering up the poor work ethic of lower performing students and giving them hand out grades they don’t deserve.
The students supporting the Socialist cause argue that, if they curve was removed, UCF’s educational foundation would be reduced to “Crony Academia.” This flawed structure claims that forming study groups and attending professors’ office hours entitles students to higher grades.

If a teacher provides frequent feedback on the blog, permitting students to rewrite posts, most of the writing process steps are covered (brainstorming, outlining, rough draft, revision and editing.

Lavine, already a controversial figure at the Medill School of Journalism because of the curricular changes he has instituted since 2006, came under scrutiny in a Feb. 14 Chicago Tribune article after a column in Tuesday’s Daily questioned his use of anonymous sources.
In last spring’s alumni magazine, Lavine wrote an introductory letter that quoted an anonymous Medill junior talking about an advertising class.
Columnist David Spett contacted the 29 students in the class, but none said they had made the comment to Lavine, via e-mail or in person.
“The quotes (Spett) wondered about are what students told me,” Lavine said in a written statement to Medill faculty Thursday, adding that the letter in question included a link to a video with students saying similar things.
The letter is still online in the archived magazine, but the video was no longer available.
“There was no shortage of material from students for these quotes,” he said.
Earlier this year, a professor at the University of Missouri was fired as a columnist for the university paper after it was revealed that he had taken quotes from a story reported by a student.

There was a kindergarten teacher that I thought would make a great first grade teacher. She was reluctant to move from her K-5 class to first grade. First grade is a critical grade for children and there is a high level of expectation on results. First graders need to end the year as strong readers. That’s critical for their success for the rest of their academic career.
As a last resort I tapped into the Hawthorne effect as a motivator to get the teacher to sign on to first grade. I told her that we would create an “advanced first grade class.” We would identify the brightest students in the kindergarten classes and shepherd them into an advanced first grade class, and she would be the teacher. I explained that while this was an experiment I had high expectations of this class, that they would be super-performers. The teacher jumped at the challenge, as any good teacher would.
Needless to say, near the end of the school year, when the standardized test scores came back, her class significantly outscored the other five first grade classes. Not a small feat given that the rest of the first grade classes all scored one to two grade levels above the national norm. The funny thing, of course, was that there really was no “advanced” placement done by administration. We didn’t hand pick any of the students in her class. They were just

Such factors include the teacher’s use of eye contact, the grouping of students, the layout of the classroom, and the amount of time the teacher and students talk, as well as building rapport with students and maintaining discipline within the classroom. Ultimately these factors are important for a teacher to understand as they have the propensity to determine learning outcomes.
This post was written by our TEFL certification graduate Sarah L.
The teacher’s use of eye contact, gesturing, voice clarity and projection are all important considerations within a classroom setting, as they allow a teacher to build rapport and convey meaning. The use of these can ensure students become engaged, encouraged and interested in the class - such as if a teacher gestures to add visual interest or employs voice variation to encourage attention, - and are therefore an integral part of a teacher’s arsenal. Such techniques can be used incorrectly however which may lead to poor learning outcomes. This can also risk students feeling intimidated, disinterested, and otherwise adversely affected within the classroom, which ultimately hinder the learning process. For this reason it is important for teachers to understand how such techniques can be beneficial in their classroom and to employ them effectively.

I used something similar to the Kagan structure of “Stand Up, Hand Up, Pair Up.” Students would walk aimlessly around the classroom on my command, and then pair up with somebody close by on my command.
I explain this method in greater detail below, but first I want to explain WHY I loved this strategy so much that I used it several times a day.
•	One of the biggest benefits is that students get to stand up and walk around. Almost all elementary teachers would agree that students are expected to sit way too much. Whenever I saw my students getting restless or antsy, I would have them walk around and pair up. It’s a short brain break/movement break that doesn’t waste any class time.
•	Another huge benefit is increased engagement. When you have students partner up to answer a question instead of calling on just one person, then at least 50% of your class is actively engaged.

The social media post allegedly made by the New Mexico teen threatened "BHS students,” the same initials as Bayonne High School. Bayonne school officials say about 500 students were pulled out of school early.
And in Nutley, a supposed threat made against a school last week resulted in a student being banned from the school.
Essex County officials say that Joseph Rafanello, 18, is charged with creating a false public alarm after posting a video to Instagram depicting gun violence.
Nutley schools were closed this week for winter break. School officials say that they plan to add new procedures to ensure safety.
All of the incidents come in the wake of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen students and teachers were killed after a former student opened fire inside the school on Valentine’s Day.

So imagine this: A student arrives in school in the morning and answers five questions that will be calculated in a customized algorithm to figure out what she'll be doing that day. That algorithm will decide which teacher she'll work with, her level of learning based on what she learned the previous day, and her specific activities.
The system completely subverts the traditional classroom model of one teacher for 25- 30 students per classroom. And each student learns in different modalities throughout the day: individually with computer software, with groups, with a virtual tutor, with a live tutor, and so on.
"There are so many ways that kids can learn," Rush said. "It could be the best way is with a teacher, but that's not the only way. There have to be choices."
Based in three public schools in New York, the School of One system is ripe for scaling -- but only when the algorithm is as smart as it could possibly be, Rush says.
"We have to build in time to try new things," he said. "Some will work and some won’t, and that's okay."

Assuming I'm interpreting your question correctly: As far as I understand, on campuses with deferred recruitment for freshmen, this refers only to how long you've spent on campus. If you are a first-semester freshman, you are restricted from participating in recruitment. More challenging classes do not affect this in any way.
My school just recently switched to deferred recruitment, so the "time spent on campus" definitely has been a topic of conversation, especially if any girls had transferred/will transfer. As far as my university is concerned (and I believe most with which I am familiar, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong), a PNM needs at least 12 credit hours from an accredited college or university, after high school graduation. Advanced Placement (AP) and Dual-Enrollment courses/credits are not accepted.

Having found a book of Kwee’s writings in a second-hand bookshop in Indonesia in 1962, Anderson describes his surprise that no one could identify the pseudonymous author, who wrote what Anderson considers to be “the greatest piece of prose written in the first half of the 20th century by anybody in Indonesia.” For years after Kwee’s death, Anderson explains, details of the journalist’s life and work were forgotten. It was only recently that Anderson was himself able to write about the author, in the process considering the role of cosmopolitanism in the life of the colonial subject.

Throughout his life he was addressed as Maestro and is probably the most complete all-round talent ever measured as a performer, lyricist, musician, orchestrator, arranger and producer.
The Barry White story is dramatic right from his debut as a piano prodigy at four-years-old to a spell in prison at 16, to father of four at 18 and then ten years of often-menial struggle to finally make it as a global superstar. In 1974, he was briefly the world’s biggest selling musical artist.
The book is incredibly detailed and an in-depth study of not only the man and his multi-faceted life but also his music, some 35 albums in a 30-year career.
His music was all about love and from 1973 until the end of the decade, the birth rate in the United Sates went up five per cent. An article in the New York Times in 1976 attributed it to Americans making love to the sound of Barry White’s music.
Not all aspects Barry White’s life were particularly pretty and the book details his early years as a youth when he took to a life of crime and ended up in prison for seven months for grand theft. He was later re-arrested as a suspected murderer. He reformed after listening to Elvis Presley’s It’s Now Or Never in prison.

Born in London, Chesterton’s career began when he verbalized his first story to his aunt Rose at the age of three. He experimented in the occult as a young man, returned to the Church of England, and converted to Catholicism later in life. His thoughts on religion influenced much of his writing.
Chesterton was also amazingly prolific—he wrote fast and barely edited what he wrote. He considered himself largely a journalist, and he wrote 4,000 newspaper essays; he also wrote some 80 books (covering fiction, criticism, literary biography, and theology) as well as several hundred poems, 200 short stories, and many plays. He made his points with wit and paradox, his large body of work contains a plethora of quotable material.
Chesterton is best known for his stories about Father Brown, a crime-solving Roman Catholic priest who seems awkward and inept—he regularly misplaces his umbrella, falls asleep during police interrogations—but knows more about crime than the criminals. Chesterton got the idea from observing Catholic priests, who listen to confessions all day long, but know more about depravity and corruption than do anyone else in society.
Chesterton novels include The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904,) a political satire that many readers consider his most entertaining work. The Man Who Was Thursday (1908,) widely considered his best fictional work, is presented as a detective story but its surrealistic turns and unworldly characters

None of his books were particularly successful. In 1853 he married the American Lucy Anne Weatherall and the couple had six children.

One of the first novels ever written, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719), the classic adventure story of a man marooned on an island for nearly 30 years, is part of our culture.
Dafoe wrote Robinson Crusoe when he was nearly 60 years old, and it is widely thought that he drew from the real-life experience of a marooned sailor, Alexander Selkirk who survived four years on a Pacific island off the coast of Chile.
Our copy of the 2001 Penguin Classic Robinson Crusoe edited with an introduction and notes by John Richetti includes a biography of the author whose real life was a bit of an adventure. He travelled widely in England and to Europe as a merchant. Dafoe also served as a secret agent at two different points in his life. He was also a political journalist. At one point he was pilloried and spent a year in prison for writing an ironic satire on High Church extremism.

While a biography is usually about a real person, it may also be about a fictional character. As opposed to a profile or curriculum vitae, a biography develops complex insight and highlights different textures of personality including intimate details of experiences. A biography is more than a list of facts like birth, education, work, relationships and death. It also delves into the emotions of experiencing such events.

Isaac Asimov (c. January 2, 1920 – April 6, 1992, IPA: /ˈaɪzək ˈæzɪmˌɔf/) was a Russian-born American author and biochemist, a highly successful and exceptionally prolific writer best known for his works of science fiction and for his popular science books. Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation Series, which he later combined with two of his other series, the Galactic Empire Series and Robot series. He also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as a great amount of non-fiction. In fact, he wrote or edited over 500 volumes and an estimated 90,000 letters or postcard and has works in every major category of the Dewey Decimal System.
Asimov was a long-time member of Mensa, albeit reluctantly (he described them as "intellectually combative"). The asteroid 5020 Asimov is named in his honor.

It’s unclear where the Crown of Thorns, considered by some to be the French equivalent of Britain’s Crown Jewels, was stored in the heavily damaged church. Notre Dame spokesman Andre Finot told reporters that several of the church’s prized items were stored in a vault that he believed would be safe from the fire’s ravages.
Saint Louis’ tunic is a relic made of linen that belonged to King Louis IX, the king of France from 1226 until 1270. He carried the Crown of Thorns into Paris in 1239 while possibly wearing the tunic.
The recovery of the artifacts is the latest bit of optimism for French officials and Notre Dame aficionados around the globe, who have been watching intently since Monday’s fire laid waste to large swaths of the church’s heavy timber construction.
Initial reports from French leaders painted a dour picture of the 12th-century Cathedral’s chances for survival. More than 400 firefighters battled unusual and grueling conditions that defied modern-day firefighting techniques, experts said.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the indictment hadn’t been publicly announced yet, told The Associated Press that a grand jury would indict 21-year-old Dylann Roof. The move has been expected since Roof’s arrest after the June 17 shootings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston.
Federal officials have previously said that the shootings generally meet the legal requirements for a hate crime and that federal charges were likely. Roof, who is white, appeared in photos waving Confederate flags, and survivors told police that he hurled racial insults during the attack.
Roof already faces state charges including nine counts of murder. State prosecutors have not said whether they’ll seek the death penalty.
Hate crime cases are often challenging for the government because it must prove that a defendant was primarily motivated by a victim’s race or religion as opposed to other factors frequently invoked by defense attorneys, such as drug addiction or mental illness.
Last year, a federal appeals court in Ohio overturned hate-crime convictions against Amish men and women accused in beard- and hair-cutting attacks against fellow Amish who were thought to have defied the community leader. The court held that the jury had received incorrect instructions about how to weigh the role of religion in the attacks and that prosecutors should have had to prove that the assaults wouldn’t have happened but for religious motives.

After several years of struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and mastering the techniques of Satyagraha based on non-violence and truth, Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and straightaway joined the struggle for independence of the country.
Gandhi’s first experiment with Satyagraha in India came in the year 1917 in Champaran District of Bihar.

The District authorities ordered Gandhi to immediately leave Champaran. Gandhi defied this order and agreed to face trial and imprisonment.
Fearing a backlash, the British authorities did not try him and withdrew the earlier order and appointed a Committee of Inquiry on which Gandhi was also nominated as a member. Finally, the disabilities from which the peasants were suffering were reduced considerably and Gandhi won his battle without much resistance from the British authorities.

Munich mayor Dieter Reiter said on Wednesday that the city authorities would issue a decree ordering the the owners of the Uhrmacherhäusl (watchmaker's cottage) to rebuild the house, the Süddeustche Zeitung (SZ) and other media report.
Reiter said that, if possible, the house would be rebuilt with the original materials.
“I found it outrageous that a piece of Giesing history was destroyed in a moonlight action,” Reiter told the SZ.
In early September the owners of the 180-year-old listed building defied the city authorities by moving a digger in to pull down the building before police could stop them.
Residents of Giesing had organized in the weeks afterwards to hold regular memorials in front of the house. Local politicians meanwhile demanded that the city authorities throw the book at the developer.
A Tweet from September 5th noted that "over and over again people stop here, look at the gap, and curse. The people of Giesing won't be pacified so easily."
The property owner reportedly had plans to construct a much larger building on the site, which could have been a lucrative venture, given Munich’s tight rental market.

The indictment, handed up by a Morris County grand jury, charges Jose R. Feliciano, 64, with two counts of murder, robbery, hindering his own apprehension, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon — a knife — for an unlawful purpose.
The 61-year-old Rev. Edward Hinds, who suffered 32 stab wounds, was slain in the rectory of the church on the evening of Oct. 22, allegedly by the man who served as the church's maintenance man for 17 years. Authorities have said the killing likely was preceded by a conversation or argument between Hinds and Feliciano over the janitor's continued employment at the church.
Kenneth Mullaney, counsel for the Diocese of Paterson, said Tuesday that he also has been led to believe that the killing was probably over the issue of Feliciano's job. The parish did not find out until after the killing, but Feliciano had kept a secret for 21 years — that he was wanted in Philadelphia for failure to answer to charges of corruption of minors and indecent assault.
Mullaney said the Catholic Church, beginning in March 2009, was making a concerted effort to see that every employee and volunteer who worked with or around children completed a special, three-phase program.

A hair and scalp analysis is performed for a thorough follicle examination through a microscopic lens to assess the condition of the scalp. The units are cut and colored to look just like the patient's natural hair. The prosthesis wears more permanently because a medical grade adhesive is used to attach the wig to the scalp.

In this story, Christ was invited into the home of a Pharisee named Simon, who had not treated Him like an honored guest was to be treated in that day. The customs of the time would call for him to have his servants wash Christ's feet and anoint His head with oil because He was considered by many to be a prophet, but neither was done.

But in a survival situation, the condition of your hands and feet can spell the difference between life and death. And if you're wearing a wedding ring… a ring stuck on finger injury can go from bad to worse very quickly. Check out this trick on removing a stuck ring with plastic wrap before the condition gets worse!
Editor's Note: I want to thank Nick for sending this video. Getting a ring stuck is a big fear of mine and I hadn't seen this trick done before.
As your finger swells, the ring cuts off circulation. If you don't get the ring off fast, you could lose a finger. This is why “ring stuck on finger” injuries are so severe, and you need to act fast to prevent further damage.
“Every now and then a ring gets stuck on my finger and it’s pretty scary. I live about 20 minutes from an ER, but I also don’t want it cut off.
Have you ever wondered why a ring that you easily put on your finger has so much trouble coming off?
The reason is if the ring is too tight, it will cause your finger to swell slightly, making removing the ring difficult.
It's important to wrap the elastic as tightly as possible. Once you reach the ring, use your tweezers to pull the elastic through.
Then grab the end of the elastic

Re: How should an engagement ring fit?
Sounds as if the ring has been sized correctly. I would wait until the weather heats up in July-August and our skin expands before making a final decision.
If at that time, it still rolls around on your finger, take it back for slight tightening.

I created this video to walk you through the process of measuring your ring size. You’ll also find some more tips for getting an accurate measurement below.
Always use a ring sizer that is approximately the width of the ring you are buying. Use a wide sizer for wide rings and a slim sizer for slim rings.
Start with a large size and move down- if you start with a size that’s too small it may get stuck and cause your finger to swell, leading to an inaccurate reading.
Remember that the “-” marks mean “and a half”. So an “8-” is a size 8.5.
You know you’ve found the right size when you can take the ring on and off with some difficulty (but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable to wear), and another person can’t pull the ring off your finger.
Lots of factors can affect your ring size- room temperature, salt intake, hydration level, hormones…you get the idea. If possible, measure your size on several different days to get the average. This is especially important if you are buying a ring with stones all the way around as it may be difficult to adjust the size.
Gents, if you’ve never worn a ring before it’s probably going to feel weird at first. You may think it’s too small, but you’re probably just not used to

Retrieved Text: Many factors affect the size of fingers, from temperature to stress, from activity using the hands to pregnancy. The size can vary drastically from one day to the next. Before being fitted for a ring, ideally you would take a measurement when your finger was larger so the ring would always be comfortable, but that is usually not the case. Over the course of time, rings can become dangerously tight. The goal is to remove the ring before that time comes.
You should be able to turn the ring in a circle around your finger. This means that the ring is not stuck to your skin underneath it. This also allows the skin underneath the ring to breathe. If you cannot turn the ring, ice your finger with ice pack for 10 minutes, then allow your finger to dry. If you can comfortably move the ring after icing, the fit is OK. If you still can't move the ring, it is too tight.
Being able to move the ring upwards on your finger indicates a good fit. Ideally, you should be able to take it off from time to time to allow the finger to breathe, but that's not always possible, especially after years of wearing the ring. If the ring won't budge, try icing the finger as above, then apply some olive oil or body wash to the skin around the ring. If this doesn't work, then seek the help of your doctor.
Your finger with the ring should feel just like your other fingers. If it feels

Now what's so dangerous about these fret wipes you guys are asking yourselves... well, not the wipes, THE CONTAINER.
So I open the package and I find the neat wipes, I take out the black cover of the container, peel off the protective sealing, take one corner of the first wipe and make it go through the whole in the center of the black plastic cover. Then I carefully put the cover back in it's place, making pressure on top.
I proceed to take the wipe, and pull off it's corner, and instead of one, two of them come through the damned hole. It seems they are like toilet paper, they are joined together. Almost 2 whole wipes out of the plastic hole, and I say, "Ok no problem, I'll tear them appart and I'LL PUT THE EXTRA ONE BACK INSIDE THE HOLE".
As soon as I pushed the damned wipe back into the container, pushing with my finger through the plastic black hole I realized it was a BIG mistake. The hole was very narrow, made by cutting the thick plastic into little triangles, that pointed to the middle of the damn thing. When I pushed my finger inside the whole, the triangles bent slightly to the inside, with the finger.
It was a MORTAL TRAP. My finger got stuck with no remedy. I couldn't do anything because when I pulled back, the damned

Retrieved Text: On Off is one in a series of recent Sans Mind products by Nicholas Lawrence. here, the performer places a ring on his pinky and then seemingly separates the pinky from his hand, pulls it away a few inches and then re-attaches it a second later. It is similar to the thumb removal trick that your Uncle used to do to you when you were five, but this is for audiences of all ages and it will really fool you. It is incredibly visual and when done with fluidity it will get a great reaction and often freaks out the spectators. Be expecting to hear “Do it again!”.
The basic effect of “On/Off” by Nicholas Lawrence is that the performer removes his or her finger in order to remove a ring. It’s a visual, convincing and unexpected effect. It’s also only a slight variation of an effect published almost 25 years ago.
The effect itself is fantastic and looks great. The plot of removing one’s finger to remove a stuck ring is delightfully absurd and surprising. And the idea of solving the problem of a stuck ring by removing one’s finger is just the sort of solution a real magician might come up with. It’s a far cry from the standard card and coin effects one typically sees performed. The method itself is clever, convincing and most of the handlings are impromptu. Either as a quick “one off” effect, or as part of a longer routine, this is a great piece of magic.

The relevance of these state functions for predicting the direction of chemical processes in isothermal-isochoric and isothermal-isobaric ensembles, respectively, is derived. With the various state functions in hand, and with their respective definitions and knowledge of their so-called natural independent variables, Maxwell relations between different thermochemical properties are determined and employed to determine thermochemical quantities not readily subject to direct measurement (such as internal energy). Armed with a full thermochemical toolbox, we will explain the behavior of an elastomer (a rubber band, in this instance) as a function of temperature. Homework problems will provide you the opportunity to demonstrate mastery in the application of the above concepts. The final exam will offer you a chance to demonstrate your mastery of the entirety of the course material.

My blog post earlier this week about my studio packaging corner was tied in with square prints from Artifact Uprising, and this memo board just had to have some of those prints too.
I originally wanted to paint the pallet, but in the end opted to keep it natural for a more rugged feel. I hammered in the sewing pins with my kid’s toy hammer (worked like a charm) and used them as “nails” to hang the binder clips from. A much more prettier option! I also used the pins to secure the cork pad onto the pallet.
The test tubes were hung using rubber bands and skinny wood sticks. On the backside of the pallet, I placed two skinny sticks on top of each other, wrapped a rubber band around them multiple times, pulled one end through a slit in the pallet, and slid the glass test tube under the rubber band. It creates a snug fit that way, but still allows you to remove the tubes for cleaning.

Elastics in orthodontics. This patient was referred for a second opinion because her orthodontist had been trying for three years to move both palatally erupted second premolars using elastics attached to the arch wire. These teeth did not move at all during three years. We agreed that the braces should be removed, the second premolars extracted and dental implants placed.
Orthodontic spacers are rubber bands that are typically placed between molar teeth. They are used to create room for orthodontic bands that are cemented around these teeth when braces are placed. This photo shows one spacer being removed with a dental explorer.

There's always a bag of them in our junk drawer, and I also make sure my office drawer has a plentiful supply, too. But just how versatile is that modest rubber band?
Well, I thought I'd do a little digging. Myscha listed 8 great ones already. I have my own uses of course, and they represent a good chunk of the following list. But I wanted to know how other people use them. I was genuinely surprised at some of the responses I got.
So here then are 52 uses for rubber bands, ranging from the tiny one that hardly fits over a marker pen, to the giant one that you swear could double as a timing belt.
1. A hair tie. Something I still remember from my days in the mosh pits. In college, when money was tight, I didn't want to blow money on hair ties. A simple rubber band does the trick, but it can take a few hairs with it as you pull it out.
2. A diversion. So, you want someone to look the other way, maybe so you can sneak out, hide a present or just pull a prank. Fire a rubber band across the room and aim for something that will amplify the sound as it hits. As your victim turns to look, move and strike.
3. An eraser. Hey, it's made of rubber after all. Grab a few rubber

One possible solution to this issue is to place stoppers at the ends of the dowels to eliminate the possibility of them coming loose.
Rubber Stopper - This stopper requires no hardware and has a strong enough grip that the dowel can't be pulled out without a very large amount of force. However, it is very large relative to other options and is also the heaviest.
Rubber Clamp - This stopper gives a strong clamping force on the dowel if it is a size or two smaller than the dowel diameter (1/8" clamp to 1/4" dowel as shown). However, it does require hardware, and is relatively heavy.
Vinyl Clamp - Much like the rubber clamp although slimmer and cheaper, it gives a sufficient clamp force and does require hardware.
Rubber Band - The looped rubber band is the cheapest and lightest option, and also gives a grip force very similar to the rubber stopper.
Nylon Clamp - While lighter and cheaper than its metal counterparts, the nylon clamp provides less grip force and requires hardware.

Knots fall into two categories: permanent and temporary.
Permanent knots are the most commonly known knots to tie balloons, and there is really only one type of permanent knot: the simple overhand. Permanent knots are usually pulled tight so they are not un-tieable (hence, their name). When playing any balloon game that requires balloon popping, be sure to stick with permanent knots.
Inflate the balloon (duh). For best results, inflate so that 3/4 of an inch to an inch of uninflated neck remains-- overinflated balloons are difficult to tie.
Hold the balloon's neck as close to the inflated body as you can, in your left hand. Stretch the neck of the balloon with your right.
Wind the balloon's neck around two fingers (or three if you have the length to spare) and secure the neck against your index finger using your thumb.
Tuck the rolled lip of the balloon under the loop around your fingers.
Grasp the lip and pull through the loop. Extricate your left hand fingers from the loop and pull the knot tightly.
Important: When pulling the knot tight, it is advisable to slide the knot toward the balloon's body, and not away. Sometimes, especially with older balloons, the friction of pulling the knot will tear a hole in the balloon's neck-- if the hole

Omitting the finish on the FOB rubber and the paint on the key ring both give the fob a stable and non-shabby look. It might be black but consistent color is preferred above an unevenly deteriorated look. This is a detail, but the fob is in non-car settings a representation of the car somewhere else. The car shape is doing a good job, but the finishes unfortunately not.
Implementing this would costs less in the production and reduce a cheap look of the fob.

Exhaustion! He did spring up once more to remove the 42" x 48" mirror that used to sit over the vanity before heading off to shower, followed by a stiff G&T and two Alleve.
Down to the studs - cement board in the wet areas removed at last! That stuff is nasty, dusty and wicks water on to the wood - especially if you didn't use a liner between it and the joists. Instead of leaving a 1/4" gap between the shower base and the board so the board doesn't sit in water the last contractor had gone for a generous 3/4", which meant water had poured through the space - and down the stairs! See that gloopy grey stuff on the floor? That's where the tiles were mortared directly onto the plywood subfloor. This will be smoothed down when I get new pads for my trusty hand sander - and a few more dust masks!
Surprise! The Guy uncovered an electrical outlet behind the sheetrock in the shower. This is what I have been wanting for five whole years - a light in the shower. Can someone please explain why this was covered by board and tiles? Here's hoping the electricians can transform it into a wet location approved light without too much drama.

EXPOSED AGGREGATE - You achieve this finish by removing enough surface material to expose the underlying aggregate in the countertop mix. You will need a professional hand polisher to best achieve this look.

try putting oil on the needle and see if it will not stick on that. Are you using a sewing machine or sewing by hand?
I'm trying to use a machine but it looks like hand may be the answer. I can then oil it more frequently.
If you have a stainless steel needle, you can try wetting it and the thread with water. Duct tape adhesive doesn't stick well to wet surfaces. Also, you can wipe the needle and thread with isopropyl alcohol. I personally prefer the alcohol method using 91% or higher concentration isopropyl alcohol. You need to be aware that excess alcohol can dissolve some or all of the adhesive on the tape where the needle passes thru. That being said, I agree with other posters that a self-adhesive velcro tab may be a faster and "cleaner" method for a duct tape closure. If you use isopropyl alcohol for a prolonged time, use protective gloves and a well ventilated location for your project.
I have a duct tape purse/messanger bag, my daughter made. I am trying to put a velcro closer on it.
Wet the needle before you sew.
Why do you need to sew tape, it is super sticky.
Keep the tape cold? Thats a good question :) Is the duct tape stuck to anything, or just other duct tape? Duct tape relies on a rubber-cement type adhesive. Goof-off should clean the needle occasionally.
