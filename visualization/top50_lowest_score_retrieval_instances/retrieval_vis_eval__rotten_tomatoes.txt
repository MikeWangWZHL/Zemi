I don't know what it was about this morning's run but it was a really fun one. Does anyone else have that happen sometimes? Most runners who have been running for a long time know that sometimes there are runs that are just fun, but if you're thinking "I've never had a run feel fun..." then this post is for you!
Today I'm going to share with you, some ideas of how to make running fun for you if this is something you wish enjoyed more. Here are a few things you need to have to make your run fun.
A favorite running outfit. Something comfortable. You can't have fun if you're not comfortable. Favorite shoes too. For me, this means a tank top and my favorite compression shorts.
An easy pace. Running hard runs are fun in a different way (because they are challenging and it's fun to see where you are compared to where you used to be). But most other fun runs, at least for me, are easy paced where I don't worry about how fast I'm going and I can just enjoy moving and giving myself some me time. It is the only time of the day that I focus completely on me.
A good attitude. Yes, running can

Hello girliefriend - of course, you're right :-) Pattern adjusted to make it clearer. Thank you for pointing it out!
Those are the prettiest fun fur scarves, I've saw. Never used the stuff. The horror stories were enough to keep me away.
Sorry to be a nuisance, but I still don't understand at which points you use which yarns. Do you alternate them, or hold both together for all but the first and last rows, please?
You do one row in acrylic yarn - all DCs - cut the yarn, weave in your tail. The second row is with the fun-fur: you go back to the start of the row and do a row of SC along the top in fun-fur. Cut the yarn, weave in the tail. Turn your work, do a row of DCs in acrylic into the SCs in fun fur below.
Basically alternate: acrylic / fun-fur / acrylic / fun-fur, one yarn after another and not together. Does that make sense (i.e. every second row is in fun-fur)?

The only thing that sours it is the sudden revelation at the end that you have, effectively, been watching a VW advert. Sure it’s only ‘an initiative of Volkswagen’, but this implies that they have funded it and therefore expect their brand image to be enhanced by association with a fun project. Just like we may have to get used to product placement, corporate sponsorship is, no doubt, here to stay. Admittedly, their involvement doesn’t make the project any less enjoyable to watch but still, I can’t help but wonder whether VW could have spent their money more wisely (on green technology, for example).
My main criticism of fun theory, though is that fun is transient. People get bored. Sure, the musical stairs are fun now, but that enjoyment will start to wane pretty quickly for everyone over the age of 10. This video may prove the theory that fun can lead to better habits, but sustaining that fun is much harder on a practical, day-to-day basis.
“If it’s not fun, it’s not scouting.” OK this adage does not tell you what fun is. However it implies that fun does encircle an activity. It keeps you sane and intact. It enables you to smile and realise the human condition- like the Mona Lisa confers beauty on top of contentment.

I understand that my approach to collecting is not without detractors. I often get asked (or criticized sometimes), “but these notes have no value.” That always strikes me as an interesting observation. First, they actually do have a real collectors value. Customers often ask me for some obsolete fun notes that were only issued a couple of years ago. Many fun notes have limited print runs. Some are as low as fifty notes, while others print close to a thousand. There are some that are more widely available, but this is rare for fun note collecting considering that the industry is still in its infancy. The fun note artists (starving artists – yes) can’t afford to tie up thousands of dollars in a single design. Many of the artists I know, once a note is produced, can’t wait to work on the new one and get it printed.
Some of my fun notes have increased in value ahead of my real banknotes.

I never had an answer. I didn’t like the question. I understand now, that the word ‘fun’ is the problem here.
The literal meaning of ‘fun’ is from hoax or practical joke. Fun is a source of enjoyment or pleasure, but it can sometimes occur at the expense of other people’s feelings. The enjoyment that fun brings is not lasting and can often leave one with a feeling of emptiness. A certain amount of playfulness or fun is important in life, but the constant search for fun is not. Therefore I can now understand why having “fun” is not high on my list of things to do. Don’t get me wrong I do have lots of fun, but I don’t look for it and I often feel deflated when the fun has passed.
More important is the search for happiness and joy. I would much rather be asked “What brings you joy?” or “What makes you happy?” These two questions I can answer.
Joy quite literally is the intense and especially ecstatic or exultant happiness and the expression or manifestation of such feeling. Happiness is a feeling of well-being, the absence of fear and a feeling of contentment. It can range from this feeling of well-being to the intensity of joy.
What brings me these feelings? The unconditional love of my family and friends, watching my children become mature and wonderful adults, my

Striving not only to be her best, but to be better than everyone else. She may train at a frequency and intensity to reach that goal that others do not understand, but she loves it. She thrives in an environment where she continually pushes herself and is pushed and challenged by teammates. An environment where performance and ability drive opportunity and playing time.
Now consider the friend who loves to play and the camaraderie that comes from being on a team. She rarely trains on her own but usually makes regularly scheduled pick-up sessions or games. On this team everyone plays and team activities are often followed by social events, coffee or an EPL viewing at the local bar.
If they were to switch teams would they still have fun?
Each child is an individual, with already clearly defined ideas around what they find fun, and what must be endured (tidying their rooms, for example!). For lots of kids, it’s the commitment to reach for a goal that they find fun.

The objection to funner was originally grammatical, and the Copyediting post does make an appeal to grammar. The argument goes like this: fun is properly a noun, not an adjective, and as a noun, it can’t take comparative or superlative degrees—no funner or funnest.
This seems like a fairly reasonable argument—if a word isn’t an adjective, it can’t inflect like one—but it isn’t the real argument. First of all, it’s not really true that fun was originally a noun. As Ben Zimmer explains in “Dear Apple: Stop the Funnification”, the noun fun arose in the late seventeenth century and was labeled by Samuel Johnson in the mid-1800s “as ‘a low cant word’ of the criminal underworld.” But the earliest citation for fun is as a verb, fourteen years earlier.
As Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage notes, “A couple [of usage commentators] who dislike it themselves still note how nouns have a way of turning into adjectives in English.” Indeed, this sort of functional shift—also called zero derivation or conversion by linguists because they change the part of speech without the means of prefixation or suffixation—is quite common in English. English lacks case endings and has little in the way of verbal endings, so it’s quite easy to change a word from one part of speech to another. The transformation of fun from a verb to a noun to an inflected adjective came slowly but surely.

David Gardner explains how companies can benefit from incorporating more enjoyment into their practices.
Everyone likes having fun, and some companies are better than others at making this an essential part of their vision.
In this clip from the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner talks about how companies that create an enjoyable atmosphere or product set themselves apart from the competition and inspire repeat customers.
David Gardner: Number five, what else characterizes the businesses that win for me? The ones that create, one of my favorite words, a three-letter word: fun. The businesses that create fun.
Who doesn't want more fun in our lives? Whether you're for-profit or not-for-profit, when are you looking at stock or you're an entrepreneur, I think having more fun, creating fun, putting fun in your product or service, surprising people -- lots of people like pleasant surprises, that equals fun for me. The companies that really are about fun, it's really hard not to win if you do that well over long periods of time.
Two quick examples that come to mind, these are completely different businesses, but how could I not lead off with Disney, which I think has a better sense of fun and has created more fun for more people living today than any other company, possibly by far? This is a great example of the businesses that win.

The first trailer from the film has arrived and we'll let you decide whether or not it's an assault on your childhood.
If you're wondering how director Shawn Levy and writer Rob Lieber extend such a simple premise, the 'Alexander and the Terrible...' trailer gives us a clue or two: the young title character isn't the only one in his family to have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. In fact, this movie looks to be composed of several, terrible horrible, no good, very bad days, each with their own terrible, horrible, no good, very bad flavor. We don't know yet if this will make for an entertaining film, but, hey, there's something admirable about finding any way to extend such a simple story to feature length.

Violetta appears on Bertrice’s door step to collect on Terrible Nephew’s TWO YEARS of unpaid rent, which she intends to keep for herself. Bertrice does not want to make his life easier by paying his debts, so she proposes instead that they make his life miserable and then she will give Violetta an agreed upon sum. Violetta, having been sacked just shy of earning a pension, needs the money. They set off for London and embark on an adventure to make a terrible man’s life miserable.

Mullen is a “cheese influencer” — yes, really — and is the brains behind the Instagram @ThatCheesePlate. Side note: How does one become a cheese influencer? Need to know.
She was on a cross-country JetBlue flight on Jan. 11 and figured what better way to pass the time than to assemble a plate of cheddar, gouda and other dairy-laden products? Yeah, we can’t think of anything, either.
First things first: The “Savor Up” box. It comes with hummus, pita chips, bean dip, crackers, biscotti and pitted olives. That, complimented with the “Party Up” box — complete with popcorn, Fig Newtons, and salami slices — provided her with the most beautiful plate of airplane cheese we’ve ever seen.
She even got the flight attendants on board (literally) — they even snuck her a box with the salami!
Special shoutout to Shayla, the real MVP of the flight.

When one make a video game and the focus is the story, one must make sure that they are telling a story that benefits from the medium. Alternatively, and even better: a story that could only be told through that medium.
I am pleased to say that Deráciné falls into the first of these categories, that is, while its story could have been told through prose or film, it would have been poorer for it. This alone is such a rare feat that it is worth celebrating.
Déraciné uses the gimmicks of time-travel and supernatural powers to explore the themes of fate and mortality. However, the thread that connects this is one of intimacy – an intimacy that the game builds by letting the players explore the world on their own, uncovering little tidbits of information about each character, like digital archeologists.
Indeed, this approach could be replicated, let’s say, in literature. One could write a novel where now and then a paragraph would be written in code, and it would be up to the reader to figure it out.
However, it does flow much better in an interactive setting, and doubly so through virtual reality, where the process of shuffling through drawers or peeking under the gap of a closed-door feel much more physical than in a first-person or point-and-click adventure. It also helps make the characters feel much more human and alive, even

I appreciate that the author spent more time developing his characters in this book than he did in the first, but I can’t say I like Kit Livingston any better …well maybe just a little; at least he stopped whining.
As for our antagonists, Burleigh and his Burley Men, even after the authors continued development, I would have still liked to have spent a little more time with him than I was given; it might have helped me get a better handle on what it is that motivates him, other than greed and a inflated sense of self.

Design is more than just pretty packaging. It’s actually one of the main influences on how we perceive value (sometimes even more than what’s actually under the hood). And we’ve got the science to prove it.
No matter how much you love smooth jazz, it’s what you see that occupies most of your brain’s time—more than all your other senses combined.
While no one has managed to pinpoint an exact number, high estimates say visuals account for 83% of the perceptual data in our brains. Even the lowest estimates cite that over 50% of the surface area of the brain is devoted to processing visual information. Do the math, and you see more neurons are devoted to sight than hearing, taste, touch and smell combined. That must explain why we’re six times more likely to remember something with visuals than without.

With administrative burdens first on their minds, sales ops personnel simply don’t have the bandwidth to create meaningful missed opportunity reports that are customized and delivered quickly to each sales role in the organization.
To help pharma companies address this issue, Optymyze offers Missed Opportunity Consulting – an innovative mix of software and services, powered by our sales performance platform. Missed Opportunity Consulting helps sales reps and managers zero in on healthcare providers with potential for growth, helping reps spend more time selling to high-priority targets. We collaborate with your sales operations team to develop a repeatable, successful reporting structure based on nurturing sound business processes and serving the needs of all plan participants.

For a new evaluation you have likely blocked off the time of a physical or occupational therapist on the schedule, and if the patient does not show up for the evaluation the time slot is likely not able to be filled. Cancellations and no shows have consistently plagued therapy practices. Therapists become concerned about productivity measures, and practice have taken to placing reminder calls to patients the day before, as well as using text message appointment reminders.
The question of charging for a missed appointment often comes up when practices are managing patient no shows and cancellations. Can you charge a patient when they miss an appointment and don’t cancel in advance? You may be surprised to learn that this practice is allowable by Medicare.
CMS policy allows physicians, providers, and suppliers to charge Medicare beneficiaries for missed appointments, provided that they do not discriminate against Medicare beneficiaries but also charge non-Medicare patients for missed appointments and the charges for Medicare and non-Medicare patient are the same.
According to the CMS Policy the charge to a patient for a missed appointment is not a charge for a the therapy itself, but rather a charge for a missed business opportunity. Therefore, if you policy on missed appointment applies equally to all patients (Medicare and non-Medicare), then the Medicare law and regulations do not preclude ta therapy practice from charging the Medicare beneficiary directly

Over the next nine months, you watch as the share price steadily rises and before you know it, the stock has doubled in value.
You are overcome by a range of emotions: frustration, anger, self-pity, resentment, and regret. That was your big score, and you missed it. You tell yourself you’re not going to let it happen again.
That could actually be a big mistake.
The fact is, you avoided one of the biggest investment mistakes, which is to invest in something you personally know little or nothing about. While that may seem like common sense, people do it all the time, but you will not likely see them listed among the world’s greatest investors who know better.
Great investors such as Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, and John Templeton are united by the principle that you should only invest in what you know, and what you know should be based on extensive research. To do otherwise can be akin to gambling.
A bigger mistake would be to allow your natural emotional reaction to the missed opportunity to influence future decisions. Emotion-based investment decisions can frequently lead to bad outcomes. They are what drive people to buy near stock market tops or sell in panic near stock market bottoms.

One of the EASIEST things to do in trading is get hung up on missed opportunities.
Whether it is something like this where you JUST missed a big opportunity, a news trade that is going crazy and you know massive potential is there but you’re not in the market, or a trade you closed out of that then continued way, way further in your direction and you took a 1% profit where you could have had a massive 5% profit.
These are all scenarios that I have seen cause traders to lose composure.
The most common mistake is jumping into a position for fear of missing out. And I am begging you not to do that.
1. There will ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS be another opportunity.
It is the beauty of investing. There is literally never a time where opportunities don’t abound. Every minute of every day there is opportunity and it is up to us to find it. It is never worth it to chase an opportunity that’s already gone and risk heavy losses from that greed.

It is a common practice in India, to give a ‘missed call’ to someone to let him or her know that you have arrived at someplace or that you have done something or basically anything that has been previously agreed upon. So for example, people say, “give me a missed call when your train reaches the platform” or “as soon as you get down at the bus stop, give me a missed call”.
Obviously, the reasons are economic – this is an activity that is prevalent among folks who want to cut down on their mobile bills, the already low charges notwithstanding. We are talking about students, youth looking for employment, rural folks trying to communicate with each other for free – basically a crowd that is very conscious about their spending.
How big is this economy? And why should it matter?
““On April 5, when Hazare started his fast-unto-death at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, organisers requested the public to give a missed call on 022-61550789 to register their support. “By June 28, we got over one crore missed calls of which 76.83 lakh were unique missed calls, all different numbers and no repetition,” said Kunal Dixit of Netcore Solutions Private Limited, who is handling this scheme for the IAC.

Crafted from an undeniably strong sense of personal experience and life narrative, each piece begs questions about the human condition, hope, change and longing. Pierre poetically transforms his art into stories that land with anyone who has contemplated their life and position within our world. The decoration sits ajar from the works’ titles, prompting further exploration of the meaning. The lustres suggest the preciousness in us all, even pugilists, a reference common through his work, striking a chord with anyone who has had to fight or struggle for change in their existence. And through all of this meaning, there is a an encapsulating, joyous curiosity of beauty in each and every piece.
Pierre studied ceramics at Cardiff Universiity and now lives and works in Herefordshire. He has been internationally exhibited, won numerous awards for his sculptural ceramics, been featured on BBC television and has had his work feature in numerous ceramic and general interest publications. Pierre counts Sir Roy Strong. Sir Derek Jacobi and John Allen FRCA as committed collectors of his work. The Stratford Gallery is very honoured and proud to be counted as representation for this important British artist.

The broad spread wings are cleverly crafted from layering spoons to express the texture of the bird’s feathers on the underside while the strong, sharp blades of metal exude from the wings to give length and suggest the recognisable long feathers that the eagle shows in flight.
Williams has cleverly used the forks in the neck and body of the eagle to show the tighter looking feathers that birds possess along the neck, the thick bunching of plumage that nestles to the body has been executed brilliantly in the prongs on the forks to keep a repeating pattern flowing through the work. The strong feet clasp on to the base reflected with thick bicycle chains contorting which forms the recognisable claws of the bird. Adjoining the feet, the legs have been crafted from cogs and bicycle gears which have been fused to give a jagged appearance, expressing the ruffled feathers

The Chasing of the floral elements is very good. I am particularly pleased with the height of the flowers above the background and I am very pleased with the leaf effect separating those flowers, but there is a little tension between the two elements. If there is anything about this piece that is weak it is the ‘strength’ of the flowers opposed to the ‘softness’ of the leaf motif. I had not intended to use stones when I started but their use became essential as the piece progressed. I am glad I took the time to use the stones, they tied everything together very well by adding an underlying feeling of richness. In someways the stones become, if not dominant, at least central to the whole piece. They are not just stones for the sake of using stones.

We watch movies to be entertained, and good movies can inspire conversation and deepen the connection that we have with one another. The key is to find films that will be meaningful for both you, to have the perfect date night movie… and don’t forget the snacks!!!
Oftentimes however, couples have different interests, which can make picking the perfect date night movie a challenge.
Tasty Recipes: The most epic dinner!
Let’s get clear, going uber-romantic is not always the best idea. Funny is good, but you might want to avoid extreme gross-out humor. Action is always a good idea. The point is, you want to express a part of your personality to your significant other/potential significant other, but you don’t want to kill the mood or make things uncomfortable.
Once you’ve got a movie picked out, it’s important to plan the rest of the evening as well.
Watching Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling sing, dance, and fall in love is always satisfying, but when it’s accompanied by some delicious José Olé Taquitos, it takes satisfaction to a whole new level.
Whatever you choose to watch, make sure it’s something you will both enjoy. Movies were created to entertain us, make us laugh & cry, and draw us closer together on the couch.

This is not one of Christie's better known stories but I've always liked it. It's atmospheric and I've always thought the murder and motive quite clever and surprising. In general, the performers do quite a nice job, though the person who plays the Met inspector (and why is it a "Met inspector" when it's supposed to be Superintendent Battle???) overdoes it and makes the character unattractive. The real problem, though, is whoever adapted the original story. I've come to terms with adaptions that change the original story out of love and respect for it, that seem to play with the characters or story in order to examine various aspects of the original in a new light. It's taken me a while to get to that point, but the new Marples and Poirots on TV have finally brought me to being a bit more open minded about my Christie adaptions. This adaption, however, does not play with the story or characters in order to examine them in a new light, it just changes them for no good reason other than that it seems to think Christie's original plot wasn't smart enough so it will fix it up by making a number of the attractive characters into jerks.

There is nothing Grinch-like to this incarnation. This isn't "The Grinch", this is Grinchᴸᴵᵀᴱ.
Without a truly grumpy Grinch, and without the Seussical aesthetic, The Grinch is just a standard and serviceable Christmas movie.
The Grinch took out too much, without adding much of anything. It wasn't Seussian enough and didn't add enough of an original plot to hold adult interest. Its humor also fell flat.
I'm glad that they tried to make this feel like a true Seuss story, rather than something to irreverent...I just feel like it didn't have to be this soft. It could've been a bit edgier.
They have once again taken a story that is perfect as a half-an-hour tale and padded it to make it longer than it should be.
Dr. Seuss' The Grinchstays true to the original story, gets deeper into what drives the Grinch but ultimately, it never quite lives up to the original animated special.

Personally, it depends on what the rest of the coins in the album look like. If the rest of your album has problem/toned coins, then I'd choose the 35D. If it's original color/normal color, then I'd go with the 55D until I could find a decent UNC 1909 or 1909 VDB (which wouldn't be that expensive) because, even though a nice 55D is a good example of an UNC Lincoln, it's just not as "cool" as a 1909 IMO.
The original post was just a rhetorical question. '55 without a shadow of a doubt.

Five stars for this classic album, but 3 stars for the 2011 reissue until the audio issues are worked out.
Frontier Records was kind enough to get back to me on the 2011 reissue audio glitch.
> first release of the dang thing.
> some other anniversary edition of OTOP!
So while it's unfortunate that the 2011 remaster will continue to have this issue, I think it's still well worth picking up. It's a half second of frustration, but the rest of the remaster sounds great. Hopefully they'll fix the issue on a future release.

It's Oskari’s turn, and whatever animal he kills--if he succeeds--will symbolize who he will become. But the idea of spending a night alone in the forest makes him queasy, and the ceremonial bow he has to use is too big for him. Not long after he sets out, Oskari comes across a strange creature in the woods, emerging in eerie blue light from a smoking steel pod. He assumes it's an alien, until the figure introduces himself . . . as the president of the United States. Air Force One, sabotaged, has crashed, and the president is running for his life. Will Oskari be brave enough, strong enough, and smart enough to save the president and himself? Soon to be a major motion picture starring Samuel L. Jackson as President of the United States!

That's some dystopian sh*t for a kid's movie if you really stop to think about it.
Aside from that, the rest of the movie is totally adorable. From the overly happy dance sequences to the wild parties and glitter everywhere, the movie is nonstop fun. Even during the "serious-ish" parts. The trolls and their propensity to sing and hug can't help but make you smile.
The movie is clever in that it mixes both familiar popular music with a couple of original tracks, making the musical interludes easier to watch the first time. Instead of having to decide whether or not you like each song, you know already know most of them, including the best song ever, True Colors. And honestly, Anna Kendrick's singing voice does not get enough credit. It's clear and precise and it sounds young and perky enough match the cuteness of her troll character.

Blue Bottle Coffee is the selfless provider of this recipe, which doesn't involve any heat, and takes eight to 12 hours of steeping—perfect for setting up the night before. After combining coarsely ground coffee, chicory, and water in a stock pot, you simply strain out the concentrate the next day, add a measured amount of simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, quickly boiled and mixed), and add milk and ice to each glass to taste.
If you make too much, you can keep the unsweetened concentrate in the fridge for up to a week, while the sweetened stuff lasts one or two days. If you think of it a few hours before bed on Sunday night, your weekday mornings can be much nicer.

So, since we're talking Deadpool, we're eating chimichangas. If you're familiar with the character, this food choice doesn't need much explanation. For those of you who aren't, this page from the comics should tell you everything you need to know.
You see, Deadpool loves to say chimichanga--because who doesn't? It's sort of his thing. But if the above is to be believed, he doesn't actually like the food all that much. The goal here, of course, is to change that with a chimichanga recipe no one could hate.
A chimichanga is basically a fried burrito with unknown origins. In fact, there also isn't a lot of agreement on what exactly should be inside a chimichanga. You can have steak, chicken, beans, rice, or all of the above. The defining characteristics are really stuffing a flour tortilla with ingredients and frying.
Here's the problem: I have no desire or intention of buying myself a deep fryer. So then I have to ask myself whether I have a pan deep enough to fill with oil and deep fry a bunch of giant-stuffed burritos. The answer is an obvious and resounding no.
But how do you make a chimichanga without deep frying it? The answer turned out to be spectacularly simple: mix melted butter with oil, brush it over the flour tortilla, and bake at a high heat. That gave me a nice crispy tortilla, without skimping on the flavor.
Prior to baking, I stuffed the chimichanga with refried beans, a shredded chicken mix, and cheese. I

So, this is fun, this film. I really enjoyed it.
What attracted you to it and how did you get involved?
It's a brilliant script, it really is. It reminded me of The Devil Wears Prada a bit, between Georgie [Tamsin's character] and Kim.

The comedy is original and genuinely funny, I have laughed out loud many times reading this book. But the story and the plot are also really engaging. The opening two or three chapters seem quite character-dense but they all soon come to life and there is no padding, filling or wasted time reading unnecessary stuff. There is a real feel for Blackpool in the 80's (when it is set) and the story just flies along right up to the finale, the climax. There's tension, drama, twists and lots of laughs. A really well written, funny and engrossing book that I shall read again.

Floral velvets, patchwork chevrons, even a wide-wale corduroy turned up here, and though trousers are still relatively new for the designer, he made a persuasive case for them—they looked sleek and aerodynamic. He cited Mariana Schiano, Loulou de la Falaise, and other "rule-less women" as muses.
Otherwise, the collection had an uptown bohemian vibe—hippie and trippy (see the kaleidoscopic floral print) but still polished in the GV way. Like many pieces in the offering, Valli's knee-high boots were covered in a floral motif of one sort or another. In materials other than leather, they're the kind of thing a woman could conceivably buy before summer starts (when these clothes and accessories arrive in stores) and wear straight through until the first snowfall. The lineup's big surprise was fur: Mixed in amid a fox chubby and a sheared, patchwork mink was a generously proportioned floor-scraper—100 percent gloriously faux.

I persisted with it for a few hundred metres before just gritting my teeth and heading straight for the highest point on the skyline.

'Burning' has more of a leftfield vibe to its pop compared to the latter track, with its gloriously kaleidoscopic melody which gives the track an occasional and pleasant dream-pop undercurrent.
This appears to be their most straight-forwardly pop track yet, perhaps going some way to explain why I haven't quite clicked with their past material, which arguably was imbued with much more of a psychedelic element.

Five years in the making, their unique approach to music blends the space of the Scandinavian Jazz scene with the creative opportunities of subtle turntablism. These highly skilled players seek a careful balance between precision and improvisation, combining the power of a jazz piano trio with the solo recordings of specially recorded performances of local musicians, both straight and scratched.
Lund Quartet consist of the self-taught Simon Adcock on piano and theremin, hip hop producer Jake Wittlin on turntable, and the dub, ska and drum ‘n’ bass influenced Rob Childs and Sam Muscat on double bass and drums. In 2010, they decided to dedicate themselves to the Lund Quartet by renting out an industrial unit in a car mechanic’s yard and building their own studio, with materials and equipment scavenged from skips and willing friends. This ability to build from the most diverse of sources is at the heart of the Lund Quartet manifesto.
At ease with technology, their compositions often form around the recording of a hypnotic groove, then inviting someone to play over it. This is then chopped up, sampled and replayed through the turntable. Check out a beautifully filmed live version of ‘Sequoia’ on YouTube to see this almost effortless process at work. A rhythmic pulse of the double bass. A train-trackdrum pattern and an emotional sweep of piano keys. Then along come the gloriously plaintive Afro horns, distorted and scratched.

Blow Your Mind is the Canvey Island-born Johnson’s first album of original songs for three decades, and it comes on the heels of the successful Going Back Home, recorded with The Who’s Roger Daltrey on vocals, released in 2014. Since then, Johnson has come back cured from a terminal cancer diagnosis and is riding a wave of popularity that he hasn’t experienced since his days as chief songwriter and guitarist in Dr Feelgood. Now he’s back doing what he does best – writing excellent, rhythmic songs in his unmistakable Thames Delta style.
No radical departure from his signature garagey blues, Blow Your Mind is a reliably exhilarating set of 12 songs recorded with his usual rhythm section of Norman Watt-Roy on bass and Dylan Howe on drums. Highlights include Marijuana, a 12-bar gem which features that “misery” line and is reminiscent of The Kinks’ Milk Cow Blues, Lament, a soulful, lilting instrumental, and Slamming, a caustic rock’n’roll gallop that finds Wilko impressively energised.
There’s variety here too: Tell Me One More Thing is swampy funk, recalling Johnson’s work with Ian Dury & The Blockheads, while opener Beauty, with Johnson in sprightly form vocally, is a solid blues stomper that recalls Wild Billy Childish trying out disco. The whole of Blow Your Mind sounds gloriously live, too, with Wilko’s

Nick Clarke, presenter of The World at One, has died aged just 58, following a very public battle with cancer.
Nick had a long career with the BBC, but I know him best as presenter of The World at One, and for his moving audio diary of his cancer journey. He always came across more as a chatty friend than a newsreader, as reflected by some 2,000 messages of condolence on the BBC website, and many, many more on individual blogs and websites.
The beauty of Nick Clarke’s political presenting is that he could examine politics in the greatest forensic detail, whilst also retaining a warmth, a breath of knowledge about everyday life, and a touch of little humour. His presenting was always elegant, and his interviews calm and measured, simultaneously detailed, incisive and impeccably polite.
Nick asked once asked what I consider to be the perfect question – proving that you could balance persistence with courtesy. He was being fobbed off by the government’s straight-bat man Alastair Darling who was insisting on talking about the Tories’ policies and refusing to answer about his own. Nick paused briefly after one such answer – just long enough for the audience to notice. Then in that gloriously rich bass of a voice asked, “Minister, just for the sake of neatness could you answer the question I asked you”. Glorious.

Gloriously simple (yet pretty complex to carry off), the set goes through a considerable number of configurations during the show, facilitated by a revolving stage. But this this no ordinary revolve.
It consists of 5 revolves in one (a Quintuple Revolve). By using the different revolves in combination (under control of AVW’s Impressario system) an actor or piece of set on one of the smaller revolves can be positioned anywhere within the area defined by the largest revolve, and can be tracked in a straight line across the stage space. A beautiful piece of design work!
Each act of the show opens with around 30 video screens hung at the front of the stage.
The back wall of the set is a huge LED video wall, and is used for firework effects and the sunrise at the end of the show, and on Broadway is used for a new sequence involving a fairground ride.
A car chase scene (following the bar scene) uses fluorescent-painted models under UV light for a particularly effective sequence shown as if from above.
During the first preview on Broadway on 16 March 2017, the revolve stopped working around 15-20 minutes into the show, leading to the cast continuing with an enhanced concert version of the show without most of the glorious set changes.

Setting its background at social grass-roots class, this movie illustrates the desire of teh common people to get rich without making any effort.
With the success of God Of Gamblers in 1989 it was inevitable that more films would attempt to cash in on its success. One of the films to do so starred a young rising star by the name of Stephen Chow, and that film would help certify him as one of the better comedy actors in the circuit. Few people could have told that he would go on to become possibly the biggest star in Hong Kong cinema within the next decade or so. So as I am dying with anticipation for his upcoming Kung Fu Hustle, I looked back at his gambling comedy All For The Winner.
I must admit that I had heard quite a lot of good things about this film. Part of this might just have been hype and anticipation due to the film being unavailable on DVD prior to this Mei Ah remastered release. After viewing the film I realise it must have been this as I found very little positive features in the film.

Retrieved Text: B - Funny People represents a distillation of the best qualities from Judd Apatow's previous film, Knocked Up. In this dark, meandering tale of second chances and human fallibility, the director employs both his ruthless pursuit of affecting emotional detail and the self-effacing vibe of star Seth Rogan (in his plush animal mode). Meanwhile, the film jettisons the last Apatow outing's retrograde sexual politics and ridiculously pat conclusion, resulting in a melancholy film that reveals the director not as an intrinsically comedic film-maker, but as someone interested in the absurdity of psychological landscapes. Thus, Funny People, while hardly a barrel of laughs, is nonetheless perceptive, audacious, and weirdly charming. Adam Sandler indicts his own career via a thinly-veiled alter ego, and Leslie Mann's character devastatingly demonstrates how bright, bighearted people can make unbelievably stupid decisions. Apatow's focus on his characters' feelings rather than the narrative is both a strength and a weakness. Absent a conventional structure or a clear antagonist, Funny People spins off the rails a bit in the final half-hour, as the director searches for a way to conclude a story that has no end. Still, the film proves to be an invigorating slap to viewers expecting yet another storybook conclusion.

One, I should not expect to laugh as I complete the remaining 21 films on the list. Two, the sense of humor of the AFI voters leaves something to be desired. This film is the classic case of a film that has a funny premise but does not deliver on the promise. Sure, it’s funny to see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis dressed like women. Yes, Marilyn Monroe plays her ditzy blonde for a few laughs. And sure, the funniest line in the film is saved for the end as goofy Osgood Fielding delivers a deadpan “nobody’s perfect” upon finding out that the “woman” of his dreams is in fact a man in drag. But over all the film isn’t that funny. In fact, it’s rather ridiculous.

However, in this instance, rather than detail a specific joke, “The Last Laugh” asks the question, can you successfully perform a joke about the Holocaust?
To counter the irreverent discussion of an extremely reverential topic, the film follows Renee Firestone…a survivor of Auschwitz who has been outspoken about the need to enjoy life post-internment. She acts as a kind of ultimate arbiter…judging jokes as funny, distasteful, or most often, just not funny in or out of context, while watching them on YouTube. But the talking heads are where the film shines. Mel Brooks, Rob & Carl Reiner, Gilbert Godfrey, Sarah Silverman, Jeffrey Ross and on and on (including actual Holocaust survivor, Robert Clary)…a virtual who’s who of comics willing to step off the ledge of good taste in hopes of landing a laugh…or, at least, willing to discuss the ins and outs of post-WWII humor as it relates to Jews..and, among other things, the differentiation of Nazi jokes versus Holocaust jokes…and/or if there can even BE a Holocaust joke.

Not that a film being stupid is inherently bad. The same holds true for an intelligent film. Quality and intellectual stimulation are not mutually exclusive. What remains to be seen when dealing with such a film is if it’s a funny kind of stupid or just stupid. More often than not, unfortunately it ends up being the latter.
One of the examples of this stupidity that just misses the mark is the character of the Repair Man played by Chevy Chase. Now I am not one of those people who disowned Chase after the 1980s, the problem in fact isn’t his performance but his character. Granted there are jokes made to the effect that his dialogue is vague and not very helpful but ultimately his repeated appearance becomes a hinderance to the story. Instead of watching to see if these characters can replicate the past they are now in we get distracted by his repeatedly reminding us of his existence. The more he appears without answering questions about how to get back to the present the more questions you ask yourself about his character and thinking about such things in a film like this is the death knell for said work.

Lyonne, who has a strong presence and the ability to simultaneously play comedy and drama, is a revelation here as the bewildered and befuddled cheerleader. She's surrounded by an interesting and eccentric lot of characters including her parents, friends, classmates, camp counselors and other campers.
There is no groundbreaking comedy, yet the film is consistently funny. Writer/Director Jamie Babbitt takes a satirical approach to the film that works quite often, though never to a hysterical degree. Novelty casting works well, including RuPaul as one of the camp counselors and Camp Director Cathy Moriarty heads full force into her character. As a friend, Clea Duvall is a sweet, yet comical revelation.
The film never really takes sides, pokes fun at both sides and, ultimately, allows the characters to be who they are. At a mere 81 minutes, the film moves quickly and resolves smoothly.
"But I'm a Cheerleader" is a solid video rental. It will make you laugh, but despite its somewhat pointed topic it will never really challenge you to think.

When that doesn’t happen, we get a comedy about not acting your age or fighting societal implications. This is usually accompanied by Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman or Robert DeNiro mugging for the camera in a way that almost invalidates the career they have forged to this point.
Most of you will forget this film exists and try to remember it by the time it hits home video. While that’s not exactly the best of praise, it’s realistic. This isn’t a film for a wide audience. It’s a movie for people living through the moments that might have passed them by a generation ago. Their jokes aren’t your jokes and that’s fine. It’s not like this crowd was going to Deadpool 2 this weekend anyways.

However, this poster for Pineapple Express, which also has quite a few stoned references and jokes, leaves me cold. But does that mean anything? Not much probably. I’m sure a lot of other people will have the opposite reaction. I myself don’t even think Bad Batch will be a better film than Pineapple, based on the the people involved in each. But it is a data point.
I do agree with Chris that this poster is trying to sell the film as pot and guns, and is doing that very clearly. It’s easy to look at the poster, at their formation, their expression, the guns and the smoke and think “action film, but the heroes are high.” So good job on that aspect.
But although I can imagine a film like that being lots of fun, Pineapple is just not getting to me. Perhaps it’s just the wrong kind of humor. Perhaps it’s because the characters look annoying as hell in the poster, especially James Franco (contrast that with Superbad and Knocked Up, where the characters looked funny and relatable). Perhaps I just have a prejudice against pot smokers that I didn’t know before, and that for some reason didn’t stop me from enjoying Knocked Up. I don’t know what it is exactly, but it’s just not making me smile.
Bad Batch is funnier. (Got my hands on a screener copy.) Should be coming out soon…hopefully!
I love that film- it’s so, so funny!

Retrieved Text: Watching Semi-Pro was a litle bit of an odd experiece for me, mostly because Semi-Pro is pretty much the same as every other Will Ferrell film, except in this one he plays basketball. Are there really many differences between his characters Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, and Kicking and Screaming (albeit he plays the straight man for a good portion of the film). Its an odd career choice, but the movie really isn't about his career choices, and neither should this review, really the main question to be asked is, "Was it funny?"
The answer is, "a little bit". Unfortunately, Semi-Pro is very hit and miss, and most of the jokes are miss. The biggest laughs of the film really come from two scenes, an odd game of russian roulette and a scene in a bear cage, that is widely seen in the trailer. One difference found in this film, outside of Ferrell's typical schtick, is that it's been infected with the Judd Apatow, vulgarness for vulgarness sake mentality. A well placed cuss word for a joke, I don't mind, but the repeated and gratuitous use of profanity can really be off-putting.
I cannot reccomend this film to anyone but a big fan of Will Ferrell, as it really doesn't have anything going for it, except for some funny adlibbing by Ferrell and his friends. If a couple funny lines is what your looking for, then go for it, but its just average to me.

Yes, Knowing got panned by virtually all critics (34% at Rottentomatoes). And yes, it has Nicholas Cage in the lead. But I went to see it any ways for two reasons: 1) Roger Ebert considered Knowing "among the best science fiction films" he has seen - he usually knows what he is talking about, and 2) it is directed by Alex Proyas, who earlier did Dark City - a beautiful and fantastic film from 1998 (unfortunately, Proyas also did the horrendous I, Robot). So Ebert's reputation was clearly on the line. Well, I'm glad to report that my time was not wasted and Knowing turned out to be a very good film. Plus, there is ample material to talk about science & religion - in particular about determinism and randomness, if there is a purpose to the universe, and the benefits and pitfalls of competing ways of knowing: science and religion. If you are interested in checking out the film, don't read further. In fact, I'm not even embedding its trailer here - it gives away too much of the plot (If you are planning on seeing the film, ignore these articles, otherwise, here is Ebert's review of Knowing, his analysis of the film, and his guess as to why most critics hated Knowing).
Fundamentally, the movie is about causal determinism. Unfortunately, at one of the key discussions, it conflates determinism with purpose and randomness with chance. But you can have a completely deterministic universe without any purpose. For the most part

Noting his very evident distress, Parton and I quickened our pace and soon caught up with the stranger, who, as we reached his side, fell forward upon his face in a fainting condition?as well he might, for not only must he have suffered great agony from a sprained ankle, but inspection of his person disclosed a most extraordinary gash in his right arm, made apparently with a sharp knife, and which was bleeding most profusely.

I started to search at the internet for alternative medicine. Also I went to your store because I had always good experience with the advice that PS&T health store gave me with the information I had. At first I bought derm e for treating his itchy+dry skin. You recommended that it would be good if he started to take Allimax against the cellulitis. With the natural derm e cream my dad's skin immediately stopped to itch and in only few days later the redness started to get better as well as the dry skin+wounds. One good milestone was achieved! Taking Allimax, after approx. 1.5 weeks his unstable blood sugar started to get standard results, This was great too (Unexpected beneficial side effect!). Approximately 6 weeks later his leg started heal and the inflammation stopped. The skin went back to show a healthy color. My dad was happy again, full of energy and optimism. Unexpectedly natural remedies were working and the forecast of his doctors were wrong. He is now going again to the gym... :-) and the doctors are speechless! And as daughter at first I am happy seeing my lovely dad again happy and with a healthy spirit! And 2nd I am grateful that the natural medicine has proven that conventional medicine was wrong with his diagnostic. Thank you."

The whole disposal procedure is well documented and recorded so if the authorities request any info, we have it to hand.
The WEEE Regulations were introduced to the UK just after the millennium, and require all organisations to dispose of their old IT Equipment via computer WEEE Recycling companies that have the relevant licenses / permits. These companies also have to complete and keep waste records. As they are also receiving hazardous waste at their site, they have to complete hazardous waste returns. For each hazardous waste transfer note on each return, we have to pay £10 to the environment agency. Computer recycling Newcastle holds a T11 exemption which allows us to collect, transport and refurbish / recycle computer equipment. As we hold a T11 exemption, we have to keep complete records of everything that has been refurbished and PAT tested. The environment agency checks these every time they visit our site (every 3 month).
The waste hierarchy in conjunction with the WEEE regulations, requires all organisations to consider re-using and repairing their IT Equipment before using WEEE Recycling Newcastle. The fact of the matter is: It is easier to replace instead of repairing. Repairing and fixing IT Equipment is a time consuming job which we know you don’t have time for, that is why WEEE Recycling Newcastle will do this task for

Environment committee members met on Tuesday night to discuss the results of a 1000-home six month trial of smaller kitchen waste caddies across Uttlesford.
At the meeting district councillor Elizabeth Godwin said that although she can see the need for a smaller bin for flats she was "horrified" by the trail.
She added: "The new food waste caddies were always going to be too small. All you need to do is prepare one large family meal or have a small party of guests and the amount goes straight up. It has use in small flats and houses but the rest of it has been a complete waste of time."
Results indicated that the caddies could be redistributed to flats and houses were wheelie bins are not viable - increasing recycling. Councillors voted in favour of the idea.
Environment committee chairman, Cllr Sue Barker, said: "The decision to provide smaller waste caddies properties previously considered exempt from wheeled bins should help boost our recycling rate.
"The council has learnt a lot from this trial and would like to thank residents who took part in the survey for the feedback they provided.

This kit provides a simple, well designed external container to collect and contain the waste ink dumped during a "head cleaning" routine, by your Epson, Canon, Hp and Brother, printers. All you have to do is modify your printer to install it.
Most Epson desktop printers have been built with a printhead that is capable of lasting decades (with proper care) but it has one achilles heel in it's handling of waste ink. Epson printers waste considerable amounts of ink into its waste pads which sooner or later need emptying.
When the printer decides it's full, it will flash up a message "Parts inside the printer have reached the end of their service life". Normally replacing these pads is expensive, and very difficult to complete by anyone other than a qualified service technician because of the way the printers are designed.
Waste-ink Kit is designed to make it cheaper and simpler to redirect all the waste into a sealed, secure bottle which is easy to empty, clean and re-use with minimal mess. Once installed, all you need to do is reset the waste ink counter, dispose of the waste ink from time to time and you're good to go.
Resetting the Waste-Ink / Protection Counter?
Fitting a kit does not automatically clear the waste ink counter on your printer. Instead, a utility is required to complete the reset before you can use your printer again.

I wasn't too sure in the first thirty minutes and thought about turning it off many times. The icky subject matter, an invalid old man, Alzheimer's, all competing for my prejudices in movies. Oh god, what am I getting myself into, I thought. Waterworks probably. But I stuck with it.
Poetry is nothing like what I expected. High melodrama for sure, but it's understated and not afraid of reflecting life's nitty-gritty, ugly, awkward details. Much thanks to Yun Jeong-hie's performance as a sixty five year old woman trying to write poetry for the first time while struggling with whatever life throws at her, everything feels real and honest.
It could've been handled horribly, but no. Compared to other humanist filmmakers like the Dardennes and Koreeda, Poetry lacks the smooth narrative that has clean emotional closures and certain visual style or flare. It feels rough around the edges. What the film does is making you smooth those edges yourself. It makes you breathe. That's perhaps the best way I can describe it. But it feels much more real and honest and even wiser than the said filmmakers' work. I'm very taken by it.

Back in print in a newly designed edition, this influential cultural, architectural, and social history of New York is even more popular, selling out its first printing on publication. Rem Koolhaas's celebration and analysis of New York depicts the city as a metaphor for the incredible variety of human behavior. At the end of the nineteenth century, population, information, and technology explosions made Manhattan a laboratory for the invention and testing of a metropolitan lifestyle -- the culture of congestion -- and its architecture. Manhattan, he writes, is the 20th century's Rosetta Stone . . . occupied by architectural mutations (Central Park, the Skyscraper), utopian fragments (Rockefeller Center, the U.N. Building), and irrational phenomena (Radio City Music Hall). Koolhaas interprets and reinterprets the dynamic relationship between architecture and culture in a number of telling episodes of New York's history, including the imposition of the Manhattan grid, the creation of Coney Island, and the development of the skyscraper. Delirious New York is also packed with intriguing and fun facts and illustrated with witty watercolors and quirky archival drawings, photographs, postcards, and maps.

In 2001, these most inquisitive of Bible bashers released their fourth album Audio Lessonover?, opened up for BonJovi in European football stadiums and completed an 18-date UK tour which included two sold-out nights at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire. Delirious? feel their time has come. "This is not just for the church," singer Martin Smith tells Q backstage at Brighton's 1100-capacity Corn Exchange shortly before the ritual pre-gig group prayer. "It's for everyone."
Certainly, Delirious? are an unabashedly populist rock act. History Maker's triumphant climax echoes U2's With Or Without You, Angel In Disguise would make a nice Christmas Number 1 for Westlife, and I Will Follow (not the U2 song) is old-school Radiohead with added chicken-soup-for-the-soul uplift.
Aside from Smith's repeated attempts to walk, Christ-like, over the heads of the audience, clues to the band's religious bent are few, save for a chorus of "Hallelujah" in I Will Follow ("It's not one

The limits of a reasonable thinking are those that break down when confronted with reflected absence.

The delirious image — no longer the image of reflected worlds, but the impossible image of inverted reflection.

"It's been an interesting journey, to be honest," says vocalist/guitarist Martin Smith, calling in from England to discuss Delirious' latest release, "The Mission Bell" (Sparrow). "All we know is that we're still a band that's improving; we're getting better live, and 'The Mission Bell' is our best studio effort. And when you're moving forward, you don't look back. There's no time to romanticize - we're too busy. It's all progress and learning, isn't it?"
The music of this band - which has both delighted and challenged listeners over the years - has always been smart musically, drawing comparisons to U2, Radiohead and Blur. But to hear Smith tell it, the challenge on "The Mission Bell" was to make an album that was lyrically brilliant - surpassing anything Delirious has done before.
"The biggest advance on this record was the lyrical content," Smith says. "We spent a lot of time laboring over the lyrics to make sure we said something fresh, from 'Our God Reigns' to 'Paint the Town Red.' A lot of [the topics] were things we would just talk about in conversation - from the AIDS crisis in Africa to 'Is it alright for a Christian to have [plastic surgery]?'"

Angela is currently employed as a Lecturer in Adult Nursing at the University of Leeds. Alongside this role, she is undertaking a part-time PhD which aims to explore how critical care nurses make the decision to restrain a delirious or agitated patient.

Angela is currently undertaking a part time PhD which aims to explore how critical care nurses make the decision to restrain a delirious or agitated patient.
Hyperactive delirium commonly presents as psychomotor agitation and represents a nursing and organisational challenge in critical care. Delirious patients are at a high risk of disrupting life-sustaining therapies. Due to this, preserving patient safety is commonly cited by critical care nurses as a rationale for the application of either chemical or physical restraint. Chemcial restraint commonly takes the form of sedative drugs and physical restraint can include the use of padded gloves which aim to prevent a patient from grasping tubes or monitroing wires. However, the use of both types of restraint lack robust supporting evidence and have also been linked to severe post-discharge psycholoigcal complaints.

We recently attended a going away party for some friends moving to Texas that was, naturally, a western-themed party. So it seemed only appropriate to listen to Marty Robbins singing about cowboys, gunfighters, and saddle tramps on the drive over — which, to my delight, my kids loved. Since then, Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs has been in nigh-constant rotation around the Opus homestead.
To be clear, Robbins’ vision of the American West is as idealized as a Roy Rogers film. Hence, you get songs like ​“A Hundred and Sixty Acres” (where Robbins cheerfully sings the praises of his property) and ​“The Strawberry Roan” (in which a man tries, and fails, to tame ​“the worst bucker I’ve seen on the range”). So yes, idealized… but never schmaltzy.
Robbins is such a gifted singer with such a rich voice (and backed by the Glaser Brothers’ immaculate harmonies), his storytelling is both evocative and efficient, and the music is so fluid and graceful (thanks to Grady Martin and Jack Pruett’s dextrous guitar work) that it’s impossible not to get swept up alongside him in those western vistas and wish you were out there riding the trail, too. And yet, there are shades of darkness and melancholy in Robbins’ storytelling that gives it a weight and drama belying its glossy, radio-friendly nature.

But less forthcoming is the ‘why’. Why should an entrepreneur need to rely on emotional engagement, if they have a startup that has great traction, huge market, solid financials and an outstanding team? There are several important reasons for doing so.
First, everyone makes decisions on emotion first and rationalizes second. Consequently, if you don’t engage your audience emotionally you are unlikely to get them to take the action you want. For more on this point see ‘Pitching and Why You want to Stop Your Audience from Thinking’.
Secondly, people connect via emotion rather than logic and reason. If you audience doesn’t ‘like’ and ‘trust’, you they will not want to invest in or hire you. For many investors, the ‘team’ is the most important factor in their decision to invest.

Acetaminophen is a common compound found in multiple over the counter drugs, the most widely used being Tylenol. There have been numerous studies measuring the effectiveness of acetaminophen on different forms and intensities of pain, but this study is the first to examine the possible emotional impact of acetaminophen.
The study sample included 82 participants, half of which were given acetaminophen, and the other half were given a placebo. The participants were blind to which group they were in. All 82 participants performed the same study protocol, looking at 40 images often used in research to induce emotional responses in people. These photos used to induce emotion ranged from crying children to endearing pictures of children and animals, in addition to photos deemed neutral in content. The participants rated the pictures on how negative or positive they experienced the image, as well as rated the level of emotional response to each image.
The findings indicated that those who took acetaminophen often rated the extreme negative or positive images as fairly neutral in emotional response. While those who took the placebo fell in line with past research in rating the extreme images as evoking more intense emotional responses. Researchers concluded that the common and widely used acetaminophen could be associated with some dulling of emotions in those who take this drug to meliorate physical pain (Durso, Luttrell, & Way, 2015).

Second, I’ve seen people put up crummy pictures taken from the Internet of scientific equipment that they use practically every day. And these are not difficult pieces of equipment to photograph because they are very large or very small. No, these are very mundane objects that sit on a benchtop, like PCR machines.
I’ve seen people put up crummy pictures of some other lab doing a procedure when it’s a procedure that they themselves do all the time.

Buried in its press release is one tidbit that might be a plus for Lenovo customers: It’s relocating its customer-support call center from Toronto to Morrisville, North Carolina, the company’s main North American site. If this involves Toronto staff losing their jobs, it’s regrettable for the folks who are impacted. But I’m a big believer that tech support staffers provide the best help when they work most closely with the rest of a company’s team.

BASIC PREMISE: A documentary about Will Shortz, a New York Times crossword puzzle editor whose fans devote much of their time to solving his puzzles and competing.
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: Wordplay falls short in terms of suspense, yet still remains mildly entertaining to watch given its subject matter. Each year, many crossword puzzle fanatics compete for the top prize in the American Crossword Tournament. Unlike Spellbound, which glamorized spelling bees, this documentary doesn’t have enough personal interviews to draw any new fans into the subculture of crossword puzzle aficionados. On the other hand, those who are already part of this subculture will be able to relate to every moment of this film—but it still doesn’t mean they will find any suspense like in Spellbound. Director Patrick Creadon interviews Merl Reagle and provides an interesting glimpse into how he constructs the various crossword puzzles for the New York Times. Editor Will Shortz expects each puzzle to have a different difficulty level for each day of the week, so, by no means is his task easy. Brief interviews with Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, Mike Messina, and the Indigo Girls all prove the same point: celebrities can enjoy crossword puzzles, too. So what? The final thirty minutes consists of the American Crossword Tournament, but it’s no fun or engaging when you don’t really care who wins or loses. On a positive note, the cinematography and editing are both impressive.

The tone is light, the game design is simple, and there's even a brief appearance by the character of Wooster. It's not an especially satisfying read, though. For one thing, the plot, though containing some mildly amusing elements, meanders a bit too aimlessly. This isn't helped by the puzzles, which are often an unfortunate blend of mindlessly simple and tediously labor-intensive. There are some exceptions -- the puzzle on page 33 is simple but cute while the puzzle on page 95 is (to me at least) incomprehensible. Page 95 is also the source of another problem -- this page offers the reader the option of picking up an object, but there is no explicit instruction to mark the item on the character sheet; since the rest of the book spells out even the most obvious of instructions, it's easy to miss this opportunity to acquire a critical tool needed later on. In any case, this book is neither great nor awful; it's just sort of insubstantial. If you skip it, you won't miss anything, but if you play it, you'll only waste a small fraction of your life and might find it at least mildly entertaining.

Everyone's favorite talking and singing chipmunks are back and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, and The Chipettes (Brittany, Eleanor, and Jeanette) are together again with their latest adventure set aboard a luxury cruise liner that gets turned into their personal playground.
During their hijinks, the Chipmunks and Chipettes accidentally go overboard and end up marooned in a tropical paradise where they discover their new turf is not as deserted as it seems. Dave (Jason Lee), their adopted dad and a mildly evil former record producer, head in after them and the gang tackles the tropical paradise to get out together.

Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that are characteristic of naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using benchmark problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper-based feature selection methods.

The interest in naive art emerged in Russia in 1913, when the young avant-garde poet Le Dante, the artist Kirill Zdanowicz and his brother Ilia Zhdanevich, discovered works by a Georgian self-taught artist Niko Pirosmanishvili (1862-1918) in Tiflis (Tbilisi).
Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov made the next important step to recognition Naive Art. They became interested in primitive, which, from their point of view, combine Pirosmanashvili canvases with the ancient Scythian stone women, Lubok, and urban signs. They used such a synthetic primitive language in their paintings and legalised it in the art.
During the early Soviet period naive art was seen as part of amateur art of the lower social classes which was an important component of the socialist culture. Amateur art was to be showcase the talents of working-class people, which previously couldn’t be revealed because of exploitation. The works of IZORAM members and amateurs were presented on exhibition in Russian Museum in 1925. IZORAM (Mass Organisation of Komsomol Amateurs Art) appeared in 1925 to develop a new, avant-garde language of amateur arts and crafts, as amateurs artists used to imitate academic art in wall painting.
Amateur artists were the embodiment of social ideal which was put forward in the late 1920’s -1930’s. They become those “new people”, whom Soviet government dreamed to create.

Membrane-coated extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by cells can serve as vehicles for delivery of biological materials and signals. Recently, we demonstrated that alcohol-treated hepatocytes cross-talk with immune cells via exosomes containing microRNA (miRNAs). Here, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed monocytes can communicate with naive monocytes via EVs. We observed increased numbers of EVs, mostly exosomes, secreted by primary human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells in the presence of alcohol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. EVs derived from alcohol-treated monocytes stimulated naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages as indicated by increased surface expression of CD68 (macrophage marker), M2 markers (CD206 (mannose receptor) and CD163 (scavenger receptor)), secretion of IL-10, and TGFbeta and increased phagocytic activity. miRNA profiling of the EVs derived from alcohol-treated THP-1 monocytes revealed high expression of the M2-polarizing miRNA, miR-27a. Treatment of naive monocytes with control EVs overexpressing miR-27a reproduced the effect of EVs from alcohol-treated monocytes on naive monocytes and induced M2 polarization, suggesting that the effect of alcohol EVs was mediated by miR-27a. We found that miR-27a modulated the process of phagocytosis by targeting CD206 expression on monocytes. Importantly, analysis of circulating EVs from plasma of alcoholic hepatitis patients revealed increased numbers of EVs that contained high levels of miR-27a as compared with healthy controls. Our results demonstrate the following: first, alcohol increases EV production in monocytes; second, alcohol-exposed monocytes communicate with naive monocytes via EVs; and third, miR-27a cargo in monocyte-derived EVs can program naive monocytes

The story concerns Raymond Shaw, an insufferably no-fun soldier who’s just returned from the Korean War to receive a Congressional Medal of Honour. He's a bit put off by all the attention (or maybe he's just a prickly guy) and attempts to escape the hype immediately by moving to New York to work for a newspaperman.

Meanwhile, Shaw’s C.O., the charming and handsome Major Marco (Frank Sinatra, who is just so much dreamier in his serious roles) has been having some strange nightmares, in which their platoon is being held at a bizarre garden party, watching a brainwashed Shaw murder their colleagues and follow orders from an array of Russian Generals.

That’s the question, and Frankenheimer answers it very heavy handedly, but not without some skillful twists and turns. This film is, in case you didn’t glean it from my description, ABOUT COMMUNISM.

Still, it has a good "hero's journey" in it. Just remember not to take the concepts to literally, as Hubbard injected a lot of his philosophy into the book.
IMO, good Science Fiction isn't about the technology or future circumstance, but the philosophical questions and paradox a technologically advanced civilization must deal with.

More specifically, it compares standard multinomial naive Bayes to the recently proposed transformed weight-normalized complement naive Bayes classifier (TWCNB) , and shows that some of the modifications included in TWCNB may not be necessary to achieve optimum performance on some datasets. However, it does show that TFIDF conversion and document length normalization are important. It also shows that support vector machines can, in fact, sometimes very significantly outperform both methods. Finally, it shows how the performance of multinomial naive Bayes can be improved using locally weighted learning. However, the overall conclusion of our paper is that support vector machines are still the method of choice if the aim is to maximize accuracy.

They constantly bicker and fight over whose martial arts are better, and after being defeated by To, Kung leaves for Japan to further her training with ninjitsu master Yasuaki Kurata. In order to get his wife back, Ah To writes a challenge letter to her, which Kurata interprets as a challenge to all of Japan, so he assembles eight Japanese masters to go to China to fight Ah To. Amazingly, Ah To is up for the challenge and manages to defeat all eight masters. The climax is a heartfelt victory by Ah To as he finally understands humility and respect.
Again, Liu Chia Liang's fight choreography and cinematography is breathtaking. Gordon Liu gives an excellent performance, handling tai-chi sword, broadsword, three-section whip, tonfa, twin butterfly swords, spear, and numerous "secret weapons." Yuko Mizuno gives a superb physical performance, and her fight scenes are excellent. Sadly, this appears to be the only movie she starred in. The eight Japanese masters are wonderful and extremely skilled, although the sai master is a bit silly and some of Kurata's ninja tricks are a bit ridiculous.

Technically, President Barack Obama is not a “lame duck” until after the election in November. But with a gridlocked Congress, an unprecedented presidential campaign, and a sudden Supreme Court vacancy, pundits, the press, and politicos have been already quacking the fowl phrase a few months into the president’s final year.
There is even an egregiously false “lame duck” clause making the rounds online; citing Article III Section IV of the Constitution, which does not exist, it claims “the President may not nominate a candidate for the Supreme Court if the vacancy shall occur in the year leading up to an election, when the candidate be a ‘lame duck.'” The phrase lame duck did exist when the constitution was drafted, as we’ll see, but many decades passed before we started using in this way.
So, how did the expression lame duck take flight?
It wasn’t politics that first gave wing to the expression lame duck. It was stock brokering – or rather, bad stock brokering.
For all of lame duck’s disability, it definitely winged its way across the pond. The OED finds it in US political contexts as early as a January 1863 edition of the Congressional Globe, deriding the United States Court of Claims: “In no event…could it be greatly obnoxious to the charge of being a receptacle of ‘lame ducks’ or broken down politics.” Lame duck easily jumps from maimed finances to crippled politics.

(No such session occurred in 1996, during the 104th Congress.) Under contemporary conditions, any meeting of Congress that occurs between a congressional election in November and the following January 3 is a lame duck session. The significant characteristic of a lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting Members of the existing Congress, not those who will be entitled to sit in the new Congress.
The enactment of appropriations measures has been an element of most of these lame duck sessions. Although no regular or continuing appropriations measures were enacted during lame duck sessions held in 1994, 1998, 2008, and 2012, a total of 25 regular and 1718 continuing appropriations measures were enacted during the six7 other lame duck sessions held in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2016and 2014.

For most of the 1-page stories, it's an artist talking about the concept of superheroes, Asian Americans and the influence of Asia on western comics. The longer stories are really fun, bizarre and creative.
The book starts off with a comic book cover art of "The Y-Men", featuring super lame superheroes with quotes like "Feel the suicidal wrath of KamiKazei", "Sweaty Feet of Coolie are express ticket to hell", "The myopic blasts of Four Eyes" and "Special delivery from Riceman pork-fried pain". This pretty much sets the satiric tone for the book, although there are more serious stories as well.
My favourite story is "James", written by Michael Kang and drawn by Erwin Haya. James's power is super-agility and super-strength. His partner has the ability to emit light, like a light bulb.

It feature a lot of options including batch encoding, multithreading and so on….
Another very useful thing is the ability to see the terminal when encoding, Lame calculates the ReplayGain value at the end of each encoding, that value is very useful expecially for dance music as is the same value used by Native Instruments Traktor’s auto gain.
Basically a -7.3db value in Lame is equal to 0.0db Gain in Traktor, if you do mastering i think it’s something you should have a look just to understand if Traktor will lower your master or not.
Please note that it is still in beta stage so if you find any issue please report so i can try to fix that and hopefully release a final 2.0 release totally bugfree.
I’m using this beta version since 6 months on daily basis and i’ve not encountered any bug so far.
To convert just drag file(s) or folder(s) over this application, by default mp3 will be created in the same directory where the original file(s) resides, else you can choose to save to a custom location, original file(s) will NOT be deleted!!
Accepts only audio files with extension .wav .aif and .aiff, all other files will be discarted.

Consequently, the middle-aged spinster becomes directly involved in the unraveling of the gruesome crime, instigated by her inquisitive and resolute nature.
The story sets into motion with the introduction of its protagonist, Miss Amelia Butterworth, an admirable woman in her fifties, who has never experienced the doubtful bliss of marriage, but nevertheless is quite contempt with her respected status in the inner circle of New York society and her comfortable home. Furthermore, she is characterized by her inquisitive nature, which she denies being nosiness, but rather explains that she is simply an observer of human nature. Such an observation is made late one evening when Miss Butterworth notices a man and woman enter the supposedly empty house next door, whose owners are away on a trip abroad. Carefully looking out from her window, she notices the man leave the house some time later, but his female companion does not follow suit. The next morning Miss Butterworth’s curiosity gets the better of her as she sets off to the house hoping to meet the female visitor, but instead her knocking at the door is met with silence. Expressing her concerns to a police officer, she convinces him to enter the house in which they are subsequently greeted by a shocking scene, as they find the woman dead, crushed under a cabinet.

The museum became so popular that Barnum began turning people away, an unfortunate decision that was obviously bad for business. He had to figure out a way to keep people from lingering too long, so he could accommodate more visitors. He came up with a brilliant plan.
Barnum printed large posters proclaiming, "This Way to the Great Egress!" Arrows directed the curious customers towards a mysterious door near the back of the building. Anxious to see what was sure to be the most extraordinary of attractions, visitors made their way through the other exhibits a little more quickly. When, finally, they came to the door marked "Egress," they would excitedly step through, only to find themselves outside of the museum.
"Egress," it turns out, means "Exit."

Both sides of this coin display designs by George T. Morgan, which is why these coins are known as Morgan dollars. The obverse shows his depiction of Liberty. The date is near the bottom of the design and that's where the VAM-5 variety can be identified. The doubling this variety is known for is most noticeable in the second half of the date.
Since this coin was struck in Philadelphia, it does not have a mint mark. The reverse shows a highly detailed bald eagle design. The eagle looks powerful as it holds its wings and chest high.

A near miss is an unintentional incident that could have caused damage, injury or death but was narrowly avoided. In the context of safety, a near miss may be attributed to human error, or might be a result of faulty safety systems or processes in an organization.
A near miss may also be called a close call, near collision or near hit.
Near miss events should be investigated, recorded and the experiences shared to lessen the chances of similar occurrences. Most workplace accidents are preceded by similar near misses that should act as warnings. As such, reporting of near misses is an established way of reducing risk in many organizations. Unfortunately, many others fail to encourage reporting of such incidents, which can ultimately lead to injury, fatality and other loss.

There are extensive inscriptions on 30 pages, with a number of interesting poems in beautiful script. There is a poem “Dies irae, dies illa”, inscribed “William Beckford (Author of ‘The Caliph Vathek’)” – there is no other signature with the piece so it is unclear who has penned it.

I found Blue Nights to be unfocused, confusing, and repetitive. The timeline seemed off (I think Quintana was about my age but her mother was born ten years before mine and was not significantly older than mine when she was adopted.) There wasn't a narrative, more of a meandering, which was so meandering that we never even find out what Quintana died of. There is a lot of justifying of Quintana's privileged upbringing, and I did tire of the namedropping. I think Ms. Didion really did write this for herself.

The confusing palimpsest of desert drawings has attracted a host of theories purporting to explain them ever since they were discovered during the 1920s – notably the bizarre ideas of Erich Von Daniken who supposed they were made by visiting extra-terrestrials.
Dr Saunders and Professor Ruggles combined the experience and knowledge gained by walking the lines, studying the layers of superimposed designs, photographing the associated pottery and using satellite digital mapping into the most detailed such study to date.
They discovered a new design of labyrinthine complexity 'hidden' in the landscape. Invisible in its entirety to the naked eye, the only way of knowing its existence is to walk its 4.4km length through disorienting direction changes which ended (or began) inside a spiral formation.
Dr Saunders said: "Meandering and well-worn trans-desert pathways served such functional purposes but they are quite different from the arrow-straight lines and geometric shapes which seem more likely to have had a spiritual and ritual purpose. It may be, we suggest, that the real importance of some of these desert drawings was in their creation rather than any subsequent physical use."

In this research work, detailed investigations of longitudinal velocity distribution, Depth averaged velocity distribution, velocity contours, boundary shear distribution has been carried out. The analysis is performed at bend apex that is at the point of maximum curvature and the fluid flow behaviour has been studied. The results iterate that the higher longitudinal velocity always remains towards the inner bank that is at the convex side of the meandering curve and lower velocity lies at the inner side or at the concave side of the curve. The experimental results are then validated through numerical modelling by using 3 dimensional numerical software ANSYS (FLUENT) by taking large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model .The numerical results are found to be well complimenting with the experimental results.

The external iliac artery normally resides within the Triangle of Doom and its injury is avoided by limiting dissection in the triangle. When the artery courses beyond the confines of the triangle it is subject to injury by injudicious dissection. We describe a series of meandering external iliac arteries discovered during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.
Methods: A retrospective review of all laparoscopic inguinal hernia cases completed by 2 surgeons was performed.
Results: 356 inguinal hernias were repaired laparoscopically over 5 years. All but 9 cases were totally extraperitoneal. During the dissection of the preperitoneal space 7 meandering iliac arteries were encountered. In 2 cases the internal iliac artery coursed medial to the Triangle of Doom and in 5 cases the artery coursed lateral to the triangle. No vascular injuries occurred and the vascular irregularity did not impede placement of the mesh prosthesis.
Conclusion: A meandering iliac artery may be commonly encountered during laparoscopic inguinal hernia. Knowledge of this vascular abnormality may help the surgeon avoid its injury.

Mapping, geochemical analysis, cross-cutting relationships, and five new age determinations, together with prior published research, shed new light on the complex history of interaction between the volcanic rocks, rivers, lakes, and faults in Gem Valley. Research goals were to test the hypothesis that local faulting and volcanism drove the diversion of the Bear River and controlled the geomorphic evolution of Gem Valley.
Mapping of cinder cones and maars shows that some of the Pleistocene Gem Valley-Blackfoot volcanic field erupted through active normal faults along the East Gem Valley fault zone, and fault-related fissures. Following these eruptions, local and regional volcanic and structural topography guided the path of the Bear River in Gem Valley as it flowed in the low areas between the growing shield volcanoes emerging from the Alexander, Tenmile, and Niter groupings of volcanic centers. Subsequently, the paleo-Bear River assumed a northwesterly flow across the flat bottom of central Gem Valley and produced sizable meander bends southeast of Bancroft, Idaho, as it flowed toward the Portneuf River and then the Snake River drainage.

I had pretty high expectations for this movie after the first Fantastic Beasts movie, which was filled with beautiful animations of magical creatures within Newt’s briefcase, exciting romances and unexpected friendships, and an engaging, clear narrative. The first movie was an introduction into the series with fun explorations of the relationship between the magical and non-magical communities when Newt’s magical creatures accidentally get released in New York. None of the magic or excitement holds true for the second movie. It has a horribly meandering plot with an excess of characters who are poorly introduced and developed; the focus of the main characters and their relationships doesn’t continue well from the first movie; and, honestly, the whole movie was confusing, badly plotted, and, above all, kind of boring.
Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald starts off with the escape of Grindelwald. Albus Dumbledore, once a close friend of the rising villain, requests that Newt be the one to find Grindelwald, whose main mission is to bring back power to the magical community and have them overtake non-magical peoples. Newt hesitantly agrees, though many different people have dispatched on a mission to track down Grindelwald: Tina, the aurar and Newt’s love interest from the first movie; Credence, the emotionally troubled and morally ambiguous young boy; and, strangely, a completely

Why the name Meander Ink?
What started as a line of paper goods inspired by my solo wanderings across Europe, has now grown into looking back into my roots as a child, where I began making. In the eyes of a child, everything is a chance to wonder in awe at how it came to be, how it came to move and exist. When I began to brainstorm rebranding of my humble little illustration biz, I realized that Meander is still the perfect word to describe what I want to do. Because meandering is what kids do. In their brains and in their hearts they hold a meandering imagination. Before we grew up we were unbiased, our minds allowed to wander and explore and grow without restriction, (to some degree of course). And so I dream of meandering through worlds with you as I create artwork to adorn your walls, or to speak a message to your audience; to communicate a clearer method of understanding concepts, emotions, and stories; to entertain and educate a child as her eyes experience all of the wonder her little heart deserves to feel. We’re in this life to meander alongside one another, so let’s make something together!
Jamie is available for commissioned projects including custom spot illustration for publications, educational materials, signage and murals, children's books, games, and collaborations.

fight dandruff, it smells good too!
In 1949, John Parran Jr, a chemical engineer and bacteriologist from the University of Tennessee, joined Procter & Gamble. His task was simple – free the world from dandruff.
Back then the solutions to remove dandruff, like coal-tar and egg-oil, were unpleasant and even if they worked, they would damage your hair.
Dr Parran wanted to create an effective solution to the problem of dandruff that didn’t harm your hair and was a lot more pleasant to use.
In 1961, after ten years of clinical trials, Dr Parran and his team of scientists singled out a potent compound that proved successful in removing dandruff.
Their product, codenamed Head & Shoulders, was finally ready to test in the market. It proved so successful that it was launched across America the following year.
When the product came out, it was a cream formula – but we knew we could make it even easier and more pleasant to use. So we went back to the lab and spent years reformulating the product.
By 1975, we had crafted a shampoo clinically-proven to remove dandruff with a pleasant fragrance. In fact, it was so effective and enjoyable to use that it soon became the world’s number one shampoo – and it still is today.

I have my dogs on Merrick Grain-Free Chicken and Sweet Potato, and I’m working on finding a different food for one of them (40 lb lab mix) since he has had gas and diarrhea on and off for a while now. The vet said it is likely a food intolerance, that he would do best on a fixed formula food, and recommended Science Diet, which I’m not the biggest fan of. Also, putting him on Science Diet won’t necessarily tell us what food intolerances he has….
What do you mean by “fixed formula”? I’m not familiar with that term.
Fixed formula used to be what made a premium food premium. They used to guarantee that they wouldn’t change the formula without notice, which Science Diet did with the last change, so they are still considered a fixed formula food. I really don’t know who else might have the same policy. Most premium foods don’t switch around the formula with every batch. They make occasional adjustments, so they should be close enough to fixed formula for all but the most sensitive dogs. I don’t know what the issue with Merrick could be, but they shouldn’t be changing their formula that often. Changing the formula takes a lot of work and some expense. But I do wonder if they have a supplier that gets differing qualities of the same ingredient or something like that.

Although there are multitudes of great slots games available online nowadays for players to enjoy, there are a certain few that go above and beyond to provide players with an extremely immersive experience, Cat Scratch Fever being one of them. In this article we’ll be discussing why this game is so much more enjoyable than most other games in its genre.
Perhaps the biggest reason why Cat Scratch Fever is so much fun is the fact that it features a very intriguing and distinct theme that we don’t usually see in this genre. The game has a very retro 70s look with the in-game characters wearing massive afros and the vibrant disco balls that light up pretty much every single nook and cranny of the game. Due to this unique theme and its solid execution, Cat Scratch Fever is naturally way more enjoyable than most run-of-the-mill slots games that use traditional casino themes.
Adding onto the aforementioned point a little bit, the distinct theme of Cat Scratch Fever gives the developers a lot of room to incorporate many exciting visuals into the game. When playing Cat Scratch Fever you’ll get to enjoy multitudes of exciting special effects, loads of flickering lights, spectacular art work and some extremely bright colors. The

Mae established herself as a screen beauty in the late 1910s, starring in a number of melodramas of which the most familiar example today is the ridiculous potboiler A Mormon Maid (1917). At the end of the decade, she transitioned into a genre all her own, with films centered on show business, exotic costumes, tangled romance and often a dash of crime. It was a highly successful formula, particularly when the script left room for a specialty dance number or two.
But audiences began to tire of the formula by the mid-1920s. Age, scandal and a frosty relationship with studio boss Louis B. Mayer hobbled her career further, and it sputtered out shortly after the talkie revolution.

Do You Write With a Formula?
The idea of formulas in writing always makes my nose wrinkle. Because to me, formula means repetition…and repetition in writing could very well lead to boredom. Have you ever had that? Followed an author you’ve loved for years only to find that by their tenth or fifteenth book you can finish it for them, because you already know how they roll and what they’re going to do with their characters?
That always frustrates me, and as a writer I have tried my very best not to fall into this trap. That’s partly why I write in a variety of genres. I never want to be thought of as the author who regurgitates the same old stuff.

Be it producer, director, lover or journalist, Garbo called the shots, and when she decided that she was done with the whirlwind of life as Hollywoods darling she withdrew completely, leaving her public begging for an encore that never came. Though there have been numerous biographies of Garbo, this is the first to investigate fully the two so-called missing periods in the life of this most enigmatic of Hollywood stars: the first during the late 1920s, forcing MGM to employ a lookalike to conceal what was almost certainly a pregnancy, the second during World War II when Garbo was employed by British Intelligence to track down Nazi sympathisers. It also analyses in detail the original, uncensored copies of Garbos films with the exception of The Divine Woman, of which no complete print survives and offers substantial evidence that John Gilbert was not, in fact, the great love of her life. Rather her true affections lay with the gay, Sapphic and Scandinavian members of her very intimate inner circle. Using previously unsourced material, along with anecdotes from friends and colleagues that have never before been published, David Bret paints a rounded portrait of Garbos childhood in Sweden, her rise to stardom and her all-too-brief reign as queen of MGM. Hers is a truly remarkable story, recounted here with warmth, intensity and unique insight.

Winston Churchill allegedly conceived the idea of the Special Operations Executive there over a glass (or two) of his favourite champagne in the early days of the Second World War, and the operation was started up in three gloomy rooms on the hotel’s second floor, with the traitorous Cambridge Spies among its founders.

Kurtág's music is known for its concision, tendency to aphorism and concentration on small gestures. Starting from the 1970s he wrote a series of short pieces, collectively called Jatekok (Games), for a variety of instruments. From the 1980s onwards he wrote Signs, Games and Messages for solo violin. The 18 short pieces (the shortest lasting around 45 seconds, the longest nearly 5 minutes with the majority at around a minute) provide a remarkable digest of Kurtág's art.
Though short, each is concentrated and Smith's performances bring out the intensity of the gestures. The opening Perpetuum mobile (one of three in the set) does wonders with the violin's opening strings, whilst the second movement builds something striking from a simple sequence of semi-tones.
Many of the works have personal connections or other links. Hommage a J.S.B is notable for the elegance and clarity of Kurtág's inspiration based on Bach, whilst Hommage a John Cage is austere and rather equivocal, the violin seemingly unsure or unable to achieve its goal.

The smiling soul sees difficulties, and loves to surmount them. When it sees problems, it smiles, reveling in the opportunity to solve and overcome them.

While the remarkable person increases in worthiness by overcoming obstacles, the weak person increases in meanness by running away from them. Problems are comparable to a vicious dog.

According to the marvelous Max Beckmann print catalogue raisonne compiled by Mr. James Hofmaier and published by Gallery Kornfeld, Bern, in 1990, Beckmann produced 373 prints in his lifetime. He made etchings, drypoints, lithographs, and woodcuts. Mr. Hofmaier notes that Beckmann preferred the drypoint and lithograph, these being more direct methods for his image making. His remarkable ability as a draughtsman enabled him to achieve a personal style in both of these mediums. In some ways the absence of color in his prints serves to emphasize the power and intelligence of Beckmann’s complex compositions.

The idea was that those at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum were having more children, thereby reducing the general intelligence level. Then one November day in 1984 James Flynn, a New Zealand-based moral philosopher, had a Eureka moment that turned cognitive science on its head. He opened a package sent to him by an academic in Holland named PA Vroon. Flynn found that in both the developed and developing worlds IQ had improved in the 20th century at the remarkable rate of 3 points per decade. This development has since become known as the 'Flynn effect'. The Flynn effect is noteworthy because, apart from anything else, it suggests a world-changing increase in intelligence in succeeding generations. IQ measurements are based on the score of 100 being allocated to the median average of a group (say 18-year-old Dutch males). Projecting forwards the Flynn effect predicts, for example, that someone with an average IQ today (i.e. of 100) will have grandchildren with a score of 120. Perhaps more shocking, it suggests that someone with an average score today would have had grandparents who were close to mental retards.

There’s one issue that perennially sits near the top of CEO challenges — ensuring that organizations have the talent pool required to achieve strategic objectives, both today and tomorrow.
While the link may not seem immediately obvious, companies can actually build healthy leadership pipelines by thinking about them in the same way that energy firms think about building pipelines to carry oil to market.
If you want to do it right, the mind-set and approach are largely the same since both types of pipelines are long-term, mission-critical infrastructure projects that require time, attention — and a significant commitment of financial resources.
The good news is that many organizations follow this line of reasoning. They have well-developed systems and diagnostics for identifying high-potential employees. And most do a decent job moving talent through the development process, whether that be through progressively increasing roles and responsibilities, “stretch” assignments, rotations through different parts of the business, coaching and mentoring programs, and/or carefully timed development initiatives such as attending the kinds of executive education programs offered by the Ivey Business School.
The acceptance of leadership pipeline thinking reflects another trend that I have observed over the years in discussing talent development with corporate leaders: the growing importance of the HR function. Simply put, HR personnel — typically the “engineers” responsible for design–build–operate activities around leadership pipeline management — are increasingly seen as business partners.

The household spending squeeze may have passed its worst, and indeed we think headline inflation will trend downwards from here. But wage growth remains under pressure, and with jobs growth showing early signs of stalling, we think incomes may not accelerate as fast as the Bank of England is hoping in 2018. That means consumers are likely to continue to take a cautious approach to spending for at least a couple more quarters.
Sluggish growth is a key reason why we think another rate hike from the Bank of England next year is still not fully guaranteed. There are a lot of unknowns to resolve in the Brexit negotiations over coming months, and the swift announcement of a transition deal will be key. We don't rule out a hike in 2018, but for now, policymakers are likely to keep their cards close to their chest when it comes to the timing of their next move.

HSBC operates 145 branches across Canada, covering all provinces except the province of Prince Edward Island.
I think that it would be a major blow to the Canadian banking system to loose HSBC, if it were to happen. As it is, the competition is fairly weak already, as we have very limited choices. I suggest to HSBC, in addition to making all these cuts, they should invest into improving their products and services to take some clients away from some of the other banks.

Retrieved Text: The uptake of the auxin indol-3-yl acetic acid (IAA) into plant cells is of interest not only because this compound is a hormone, but also because its movement across the plasma membrane is probably involved in the polar transport of auxin. The plasma membrane contains auxin binding sites and may be a primary site of hormone action.
IAA partitions into non-polar solvents from acidified aqueous solutions because the undissociated acid is more soluble in such lipid solvents than in water. There is known to be a passive, non-metabolic component of the uptake of IAA and of the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) into plant tissue which has been ascribed to the diffusion of the undissociated acid across the plama membrane. A carrier-mediated mechanism for auxin anion uptake is also possible but has not been conclusively demonstrated.
Uptake by the diffusion mechanism is linearly related to the concentration of the undissociated acid which is a function of the acid's pK and the pH of the incubation medium. If the pH of the medium is lower than that of the cells, the cells accumulate weak acid; the equation requires that the concentration of undissociated acid should be the same in each compartment. Thus the relation between the initial rate of uptake and pH should resemble a dissociation curve with a midpoint at the pK of the weak acid. This prediction is realized for the uptake of benzoic acid (pK=4.2) by yeast but not by the bacterium Proteus vularis, when, although the curve is still that of a dissociation, its midpoint

It’s a steep drop from July 26, when SBSAA shares were at $1.57.
The sell-off is likely tied to a report in The Wall Street Journal noting that the company is “being pressed for payment by investment funds that claim to be owed more than $161 million.” In particular, 11 funds say SBS is culpable of contract and corporate duty breaches. The suit would also prevent SBS from taking on additional debt.

A green area is an area that is left somewhat natural to nature consisting of trees, shrubs, and other fauna that is indigenous to the area.
Meandering paths give a view of the existing different landscape designs of your backyard. You can use them to guide your way through a wooded area, or even to view different garden areas. Many meandering paths serve as a pass-through for the different areas to make easier access to all the different areas of the backyard. Gravel paths or stepping stone paths are the easiest to create. They also can be created from pavers, either brick pavers or cement pavers, flagstone, or garden mulch.
The first step in building a meandering path is to outline the area you will be using for your walkway with string. This type of path does not have the formal edge of the brick paver walkway or patio. Use gentle curves to guide the path through the points of interest.

This release marks a return to the 4-5 minute rock song format and bears more stylistic similarity to 1993's Security of Illusion than their last studio release, Generation 13. Strangely, drummer Steve Negus is absent from the line-up for the album, but is touring with the band in support of the release. Also peculiar is that the keyboards are nearly insignificant throughout. Both these circumstances seem weird since this is supposed to be a big anniversary celebration record. There's a remake of the Beatles' "Taxman," plus two remakes of earlier Saga songs. Two other songs are also heavily filled with samples and riffs from prior Saga material. All in all, about half of the tracks contain rehashes of some sort. Maybe this was part of the intent, but it generates suspicion that perhaps the band was short on material. On the plus side, guitarist Ian Crichton continues to show why he's one of the best rock guitarists around. He's so featured, one might almost believe this album was his solo project.

The series has for the most part been limited to Japan, but Metal Saga on the PS2 was the first to be released in the US.
“Route 99” is the overworld theme that plays when driving around in the tank. It’s a nice acoustic guitar piece with reminisces of R-Type. A fairly long theme, the song has great development , good for illustrating travel over a wide world. The synth line has a bit of cheesy swank to it though, and seems to have some similarities with Kirby. However, the piano break in the middle goes well with the acoustic guitar and is a nice interlude.
Metal Saga has another good overworld piece, “Driving to New Fork“, which uses a lovely piano and recorder. The piano piece reminds me a little of “Elec Man” from Mega Man. The track is a little shorter, but very pleasant.

Among the additions are younger versions of Nightcrawler, Cyclops, and Jean Grey, all of whom were featured in the original film trilogy from the 2000s.
That series of movies was notorious for the manner in which it concluded. X-Men: The Last Stand is seen by many as one of the more disappointing comic book adaptations, criticized for mishandling two important storylines: the mutant cure and the Dark Phoenix saga. Each one was substantial enough to carry its own film, but combining both led to a narrative that wasn't fully developed and missed an opportunity for a hard-hitting plot. With the franchise essentially rebooted now, there's a chance for a Dark Phoenix mulligan, something that Apocalypse producer Simon Kinberg would be very interested in.

Bryan Singer has announced his intentions to set the next film in outer space, which certainly plays in line with the source material.

As a populist poet, Sandburg bestowed a powerful dignity on what the ’20s called the "American scene" in a book he called a "ragbag of stripes and streaks of color from nearly all ends of the earth ... rich with the diversity of the United States." Reviewed widely in journals ranging from the New Masses to Modern Music, The American Songbag influenced a number of musicians. Pete Seeger, who calls it a "landmark", saw it "almost as soon as it came out." The composer Elie Siegmeister took it to Paris with him in 1927, and he and his wife Hannah "were always singing these songs. That was home. That was where we belonged."

We live in an age where individual experiences, emotions and reflections of individual people are getting more and more standardized by industrial products. Many (most?) people's ideas of "music" are shaped by the cliches of popular music, forming a kind of filter which filters all the music they listen to. Therefore, of course, if certain music doesn't consist of these cliches, there is hardly anything left if one puts it through this filter, and so these people deprive this music of being "music".
In my eyes it would be absolute nonsense to state that "serious" contemporary music is "difficult" to understand and, for this reason, could only attract an academic audience. The problem some people have with this music is rather due to the fact that it lacks cliches they want to recognize.
Natasha* speaks about "academic" music which gives "the opportunity for a listener to emotionally and maybe even intellectually explore such concepts". She hits a very important point. Exploring - just like every real kind of experience - is a PROCESS, and it takes time. For me good and fascinating music is music to which I can listen many and many times without really "capturing" it, and I find music boring which is obvious when listening to it for a second (or even for the first) time.

Such is the problem with The Thin Red Line, an intolerably boring, three-hour World War II rip-off of Saving Private Ryan. I thought I was going to see John Travolta and George Clooney in big roles. Instead, they appeared for five minutes each. An unfamiliar actor that I didn't recognize (Adrien Brody) portrayed the main character, Cpl.

She eventually writes back to inform him that she's fallen in love with another man and wants a divorce. Boy, did I see that coming. Rule of thumb for movie characters: if you truly love someone, if you're really devoted to them heart and soul, it's guaranteed that they're going find someone else and dump you when you least expect it.
And as I mentioned earlier, The Thin Red Line is a very dull version of Saving Private Ryan. The action lacks interest, and this movie is way too heavy on the philosophy.

Columbia presents a film directed by Fred Schepisi, and produced by Michael Rachmil and Daniel Melnick. Screenplay by Steve Martin, based on the play "Cyrano de Bergerac," by Edmond Rostand. Photographed by Ian Baker. Edited by John Scott. Running time: 107 minutes. Classified PG.
"Roxanne" is a gentle, whimsical comedy starring Steve Martin as a man who knows he has the love of the whole town, because he is such a nice guy, but fears he will never have the love of a woman, because his nose is too big. His nose is pretty big, all right; he doesn't sniff wine, he inhales it.
The movie is based on "Cyrano de Bergerac," a play that was written in 1890 but still strikes some kind of universal note, maybe because for all of us there is some attribute or appendage we secretly fear people will ridicule. Inside every adult is a second-grader still terrified of being laughed at.
In "Roxanne," the famous nose belongs to C.D. Bates, a small-town fire chief, who daydreams of a time when the local citizens will have enough confidence in his department to actually call it when there's a fire.
In despair at the incompetence of his firemen, he hires a firefighting expert (Rick Rossovich) to train them. The expert arrives in town almost simultaneously with a tall, beautiful blond (Daryl Hannah), who is an astronomer in search of an elusive comet.

The Alamo (1960) In 1836 General Santa Anna and the Mexican army is sweeping across Texas. To be able to stop him, General Sam Houston needs time to get his main force into shape. To buy that time he orders Colonel William Travis to defend a small mission on the Mexicans’ route at all costs. Travis’ small troop is swelled by groups accompanying Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, but as the situation becomes ever more desperate Travis makes it clear there will be no shame if they leave while they can.

Do you know what heart failure is? I have to be honest – I thought I did, but I quickly realized I really didn’t after doing a little bit of research.
If you don’t know what heart failure is, don’t feel bad. It may be one of the most misunderstood major health issues facing the country today, but its impact is undeniable.
Heart failure is a serious issue that needs our attention. As the nation’s oldest and largest voluntary health organization dedicated to fighting cardiovascular diseases, the American Heart Association is beginning to chart a course to help improve the lives of Americans with this devastating condition.
So, what is heart failure? Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body.
What can you do to stay healthy and prevent heart failure? Small changes in lifestyle eventually add up to big results, such as eating a heart healthy diet (low on fat and salt and high in fruits, vegetables and fiber) or exercising more.
I’m very fortunate in that I am currently in great health. I give a lot of credit to my mom and grandmother who were both very health conscious.

And when Harrison Ford actually accepted the role, they were forced to put it on the big screen. The end result is a poorly crafted movie fit only for television.
Although the film is based on a true-story – a story that is pretty incredible and powerful – the way it is told and made takes the heart and emotion right out of it.
Extraordinary Measures tells the story of a father (Fraser) willing to do whatever it takes to find a cure for a form of autism known as Pompe Disease, a disease that two of his three children have. As both sick children get closer to the age of mortality, their symptoms worsen, so their father takes a lea of faith, quits his job and searches for a miracle at the hands of a little-known doctor (Ford). The majority of the movie is spent showing you how they financially put his untested theoretical research into practice to the point where they could start a clinical trial.
Just like most feel-good movies, after only seeing a few minutes of the movie, you know exactly where Extraordinary Measures is going to end. The typical clichés in character and plot are all there, making it a gruelingly long and painful experience.

The war had not gone well for these brave pigeons. Squadrons A through E had been taken out. It was now time for Valiant's Squadron F to save the day. The group of pigeons used teamwork and bravery to face the dreaded Falcon Brigade headed by Cmdr. Von Talon (voiced by Tim Curry) and get their message through.
The digitally animated film was enjoyable, but not great. The editing is so bad it detracts from the film. Flipping from the falcons' headquarters, to Valiant, to pigeon boot camp, back to a captured pigeon, then the French resistance leaders, none of it flows from scene to scene. We just jump.

Ever since she can remember, ten-year-old Violet and her mother have been locked away in a tower by the evil Queen Bogdana, who has the kingdom under her spell. The queen has everything she wants except for one thing — beauty. Violet possesses this beauty. She also has a secret: although she is very small, both her spirit and her heart are mighty.
When Violet is summoned by Bogdana to start training to become a real princess, it seems as if her life might be taking a turn for the better. But hope quickly fades when Violet’s mother is banished from the castle, and she and Violet are forbidden to see each other ever again. With everyone’s lives in the balance, it’s up to Violet to break the spell and reunite her family.
Fully embracing the classic ingredients of a good fairy tale, Schroeder weaves a lovely and charming story about a small girl with a big spirit, and how her kindness and courage help her to change her fate and save a kingdom.
Remember that beautiful quote from Disney’s live action Cinderella movie last year? “Have courage & be kind.” I think that’s the kind of message that Violet’s mother would pass onto her, just as Cinderella’s mother did.

From a screenwriting standpoint, it’s excellent. No one gets structure and dialogue like Black, and the pacing is spot on.
The Blue Room oozes noir. It isn’t quite as heavy on the shadows – in fact it’s often brightly lit – but the framing itself is reminiscent of simpler cinematic times.
If you’re a fan of the first film, or indeed of the comics, I’m not sure how you could find fault with A Dame to Kill For. It feels like more Sin City, basically.
The script is as sharp as ever, and all the feminist, postmodernist, Raymond-Chandler-meets-Nancy-Drew elements are present and correct.
If the film had knocked it out of the park with a stunning final scene, then it would have all been worth it. Suffice to say, it features nothing of the sort.

Oh, and the alien looks pretty cool too, at least when it removes its helmet. Very lifelike. Still, it’s a touch overrated, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s smug, cigar chomping, perfectly bronzed presence notwithstanding. And man is this film a product of the 80s. From the clothes to the haircuts to the big shiny muscles, it just oozes with pure 80s flair.
The plot doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Something about a rescue mission that turns into an all out assault for some reason, then turns into a chase film, then ends in a pretty cool face off of sorts. It’s a hodgepodge of skimpy ideas that fit together well if you don’t stop to think about them too much. Not exactly a brainless action film, but trying to follow the road this film lays out for you may leave you more lost than anything else. And yeah, though the alien looks pretty cool, all the other effects in this film for the most part are very outdated. This film came out just before the big CGI revolution took hold in Hollywood, and you can really tell.
Overall, an enjoyable film. Not the greatest or most intelligent action film in the world, and some of the effects are certainly questionable, but the acting is decent, Arnold is entertaining, the violence is over the top, the explosions/deaths are plentiful, and the concept is interesting.

It was in the locker room, losing 13-0, that Hurts learned the news that he would be watching the remainder of the game from the sidelines. It didn’t matter that Hurts had brought the team back in the past. His nearly unblemished record couldn’t get more faith bestowed upon him.

It took Alabama head coach Nick Saban much longer, dragging the decision into the season and almost ensuring that Hurts would be stuck playing backup.

The whole sentence sounds to me like something you would tell your doctor. Certainly you would not use "belly" while talking to your doctor, would you?
"Belly" is actually a formally correct term for abdomen. To be honest, I think most English speakers I know don't even know what an abdomen is.
If you hang out with medical professionals, sure. In any case, this sounds like what would be said at a doctor's appointment, so it's completely plausible. True, "stomach" would be more common (but less anatomically accurate if talking about your entire intestinal tract), while "belly" would be a more colloquial (and less educated) term for use with a doctor. "Tummy" is what a child would say.
Yes, 'sometimes' is an adverb of frequency that can go before or after the subject: "Sometimes I visit..... I sometimes visit....."

Is the ACTUAL weight of the empty trailer and its load more than the listed towing capacity?
Towing vehicle: Unladen/empty/kerb = 1500 kg, GVW = 2000 kg, Towing capacity = 1800 kg.
Trailer: Unladen/empty = 800 kg, MAM = 1500 kg.
As such I can only load the trailer with 700 kg to stay in compliance with the law.
The reason it is legal to tow the above on my B licence – The 1500 MAM of the trailer is not more than the 1500 unladen/empty weight of the towing vehicle The 2000 GVW of the towing vehicle plus the 1500 MAM of the trailer is not more than 3500 (3.5 ton limit of Catogory B licence) The towing capacity/actual weight being towed does not exceed 1800.

As a designer (hand letterer, artist, logo creator, etc) who creates things like prints or premade art, it’s important to show off that art in high quality. You want the rest of the image to look as good as the art that you’re creating to help sell it better. In some cases, it’s not always easy or time conducive to take that picture yourself. Mockups are a great solution. All you have to do is open the file in Photoshop, and pop the image of your art into the given layer. It automatically fits into the predetermined space and looks finished. It’s as easy as that.
My pack comes with 4 different .PSD files (3 of them seen above). They’re all cohesive enough that they can be used in a project together. They’re also different so that they meet all kinds of needs – picture frame, tags, and a basic print.

But if you are a first-time cruiser — or just someone who doesn’t keep up with all the ins and outs of the industry — then you might be confused about what exactly chair hogs are and while they are so reviled.
What is a Chair Hog?
First things first, if you don’t know what a chair hog is, it’s a person who “reserves” a deck chair in a prime location… and then go off to do something else on the ship.
Typically the chair hogs strike early in the morning (often before breakfast), heading down poolside to get the best location possible. They will usually set out their towel on the chair they want, leaving it for literally hours while they head around the ship. Sometimes you can come down to the pool, sunbathe, take a swim, and read a book — all without seeing the person who claimed a chair with their towel.
Obviously this causes a lot of problems for other passengers and isn’t very considerate. When someone hogs a chair, they take up prime real estate on the deck that essentially goes wasted. There are some cases where a chair will simply stay empty (except for a towel “holding” the chair) all day.
Is Every Chair With a Towel “Hogged”?

I was thinking of an evaluator class which has methods for all the functions introduced. So if sin(x) is called where x is a RealDouble or any Number with is_real true, then x.get_evaluator is called to get an evaluator whose sin method will be called.
@isuruf good points. Are you thinking of things like sin(0.0)?
The problem with double is that it is essentially never exact. In fact, the compiler gives you a warning if you do things like if (a == 0.0) where a is a double.
In other words, there would never be any simplifications.
You compare doubles by the if (abs(a-5) < eps) idiom.
How do you test that you got 0.0 inside the sin?
So Sage takes a double and just immediately evaluates the function using double precision. We can do the same.
How do I do it so that all functions are not needed to be updated each time I add a Real class like RealDouble, RealMPFR, etc.?
Our sin C++ function, which decides what to do, would just call std::sin if the argument is RealDouble.
So essentially, your question is how to keep all this code local, as opposed to scattered all over symengine, correct?
I think the answer is to use the single dispatch, that we implemented.
So the sin C++ function would have an array of the callbacks, and it looks up the correct callback based on the argument.

So, I made a list of Inspiring Quotes from 7 Phenomenal Women and would love if you had more to add in your comments so we can make this list super long!
When we think of “phenomenal women”, we usually stick to famous artists, scientists or entrepreneurs but the world is full of phenomenal women who are not known and accomplish great things. I bet that if you think about it, you have definitely a handful of phenomenal women in your own life.
We usually celebrate women on International Women’s day but some inspiring quotes of some of my favorite phenomenal women can definitely work as a compass to help us become “phenomenal” for our friends and family or help us appreciate such women in our lives.
To start with, I guess that there is no better description of what an extraordinary, a “phenomenal woman” is than the one given by the famous poet Maya Angelou.
This is the just the first stanza of Maya Angelou’s poem “Phenomenal Woman”. According to a beautiful analysis of the whole poem, the poet repeats the proud assertion of being a phenomenal woman as a celebration of womanhood, a feminine world of totality that defies our society’s doctrine of specificity.

According to a Daily News source, the reason Allen’s Broadway musical about Harlem’s Cotton Club features an all-white cast is due to Allen’s refusal hire black actors to fill the gangster roles, even for the musical numbers.
Our source adds that the casting team told Allen a scene re-creating the iconic Harlem club, which was popular with black clubgoers, should actually feature some.
It is odd for any big musical to not feature any African-Americans, especially when in the workshop production — a preshow period for producers and investors — a few black actors were featured and were phenomenal.
The only non-white actor in the play is in a dance ensemble.
The musical is based on Allen’s 1994 film of the same name, which also featured only white actors in top roles. For a while now, Allen has been under fire for not hiring black actors in his films. Until 1998, the most prominent role the Oscar-winner gave to a black actor was as a prostitute in “Deconstructing Harry.” Allen has since cast black actors in some speaking roles but not many, and this latest charge is only going to stoke the controversy.
Allen’s spokesman claims the Daily News story is untrue. But that doesn’t change the fact that a play set in a Harlem club does not feature a single black actor.

Indeed, Yen does her assignment well and proving so are the instances when her on-screen brawls with Yam Concepcion became too realistic and even led to minor injuries. There was a time when the script required her to hurt Yam and she accidentally made the slap a bit stronger than expected; leading Yam to the emergency room due to signs of a lockjaw.

“Merchant” has always been a “problem play,” hard to classify (a comedy in structure, but with tragic elements and based in historical truth, if not a “history” play), difficult to discern (partly owing, perhaps, to missing scenes in the text that has been passed down, or perhaps because of some sloppiness on the part of the playwright), and widely open to interpretation (almost impossible to determine where, if anywhere, sympathy lies).
Packer and company do a heroic job in wrestling with these problems and staging a fully coherent, at times provocative, and entertaining three hours of theater that goes by seemingly much quicker than that and never lags – partly thanks to the playwright, who kept the individual scenes and speeches relatively short and snappy.
This well cast, mostly race- and gender-blind production is dazzling in its staging in the round (and even more so, at times making use of the theater’s upper level and even seats in the audience) and the scope of its colors and emotion, from the darkest of blacks and grays to the bright and colorful (and somewhat ominous and threatening) scenes of masquerades and celebrations.

A read that benefits from an intriguing and well-structured plot she delivers a slick narrative and in doing so successfully avoids the grandiose mythmaking that has been the bane of many baseball novels to gives us something warm, thought-provoking and utterly convincing. Even readers for whom baseball isn't their favourite sport or those who don't much care for sports at all will find something to garner their attention. It has the thrill of the grass and Fischer does a superb job of capturing the rhythms and rituals of the playing field and the unique bond between players but she does so by staying on the safe side of sentimentality. Yes, baseball is the theme but ultimately what Fischer gives us is a highly original coming of age story. One that evolves at a cracking pace, with Jimmy, Mangino and Bud proving genuinely inspired characters whilst cleverly nuanced subplots create a memorable mix of complexity and melodrama.

Stories like Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice joined the work of Charlotte and Emily Bronte, entertaining the turn of the century reader with these melodramatic tales. By the 1920s, when some had thought this trend had passed, it moved into another phase, with pulp paperbacks filled with lurid descriptions and the purplish prose imaginable. Stella Gibbons in 1932 attempted an emergency rescue, and succeeded wonderfully with her novel, Cold Comfort Farm, recently re-released to coincide with a new movie version by director John Schlesinger.
Flora Poste is the recently orphaned waif who finds it necessary to impose herself on some body of relatives. Her meager inheritance of 100 pounds a year is not enough “keep you in stockings and fans,” as her good friend Mrs. Smiling remarks. She writes to several distant family members and receives three replies. Most of them are appaling, except for the one from her cousin Judith Starkadder, which is, at least, interesting and appaling. She writes back and accepts the offer of boarding from Cold Comfort Farm, to find out what “rights” she has that cousin Judith mysteriously refers to. Her arrival at Cold Comfort begins a warming trend that ends up firing up every Starkadder in sight, including: Amos, the hellfire-and-brimstone owner of the farm and preacher to the Quivering Brethern; Reuben, his son and would-be caretaker of Cold Comfort; Seth, the hunk-a-hunk-a burning love

Fictionalizations of The Day and its local fallout have indeed felt like a year of therapy sessions reduced to their forgive-and-heal-thyself pan gravy. Jeff Stanzler’s Sorry, Haters avoids the obvious/preachy easily enough; his New Yorkers have already had those conversations, and his scenario eventually hinges on what we didn’t share five Septembers ago. The opening overture is just typical enough to get our jaws twitching for a yawn: Mournful Syrian cabdriver Ashade (France-based actor- filmmaker Abdellatif Kechiche) crosses paths with hard-charging career woman Philly (Robin Wright Penn), who is apparently in the throes of a post–custody battle nervous breakdown. She offers legal help to Ashade, whose brother has been renditioned back to Syria, but the worm turns sometime after that, when she suggests the two of them “do some damage.” “I don’t know anything about munitions . . . ?” she says, and Stanzler’s modest head-scratcher abandons all claims on the two-lost-souls melodrama.
With a sour twist of character—specifically, a single close-up of Penn’s hair-trigger power maven looking over a roof edge— Sorry, Haters acquires the slowly widening, fanged grin of a Polanski tale. (The out-of-tune title is a better fit for Philly’s hit youth-channel show, in which wealthy pop stars like Fred Durst boast about their bling.)

To make it fun and enjoyable, it’s not about the profit or the money, it’s about the community aspects. Events, bringing people in, promoting it, hosting and then that’s where we actually make most of our money. It’s the experience and the idea, not actually the physical vegetables themselves.
The plan, dubbed “Feed the Need,” focuses on the construction of a tiny home to serve as a bed and breakfast and an event space to host farm-to-table dinners, summer camps and events. The funds raised from these creations will in turn fuel a partnership with Oregon-based anti-hunger and youth organizations through which the farm’s produce will be donated.

According to him, it’s best to avoid snuggly things, cozy pajamas, bedtime stories and sleepy time songs, – or you’ll wind up in bed, wondering just how you got there. After exhausting (pun intended) a rather long list of possibilities, the little boy inevitably succumbs to sleep – yawns are sneaky that way!

Stable and symmetrical, with both feet planted firmly on the ground, the H has been predictable in its design and use throughout much of its history. For example, it held the same position (the eighth letter) in the Semitic, Greek, Etruscan, and Latin alphabets as in our own. Only in the hands of type designers like Ed Benguiat (or in ten-dollar words like “heliotrope”) does the H begin to exude a touch of glamour.
Many historians believe that the H started out as the Egyptian hieroglyph for a sieve. It represented the same guttural, back-of-the-throat sound (think hissing cat) used by the Sumerians over a thousand years later, once again demonstrating the H’s yawn-provoking consistency. The Semites called the character kheth, which meant “fence.” Indeed, their representation of it could be imagined to resemble a fence, or at least part of one.
Somewhere around 900 B.C. the Greeks borrowed the kheth and dropped the top and bottom horizontal bars. Since they couldn’t pronounce the sound of the kheth, they called the letter eta. It was first used as a consonant. Later, however, the sign acquired the sound of a long ‘e’, to distinguish it from the short ‘e’ sound represented by the Greek letter epsilon.
The Etruscans and Romans adapted the Greek eta for their own alphabets. The Etruscans put the top and bottom crossbars back on the letter, while the Romans continued to leave them off. The monumental Roman H was the prototype of our current eighth

People see their troubles, which range from bad parties at friends’ houses to relationship trouble, as something irrelevant or unimportant. While those problems may seem dull in hindsight, there was a moment when one night in a crowded room with music blaring and drinks pouring seemed like the be-all end-all. Just ask Lorde.
And it’s going to be hard to doubt her talent now more than ever with the release of sophomore album, Melodrama. Based on the album cover alone, the album is a brighter, more textured experience than the minimalist Pure Heroine was. Production credits are shared between Lorde and Jack Antonoff (fun., Bleachers) with a slew of others (Frank Dukes, Andrew Wyatt, Joel Little) who make the album certainly sound bigger not overbearing.
But the rest of the record is an intimate affair, where Lorde sits baked in alone, cherry-colored spotlight dancing the night away. “Liability” is a gorgeous piano ballad that merely uses soft keys, while “The Louvre” starts with a simple guitar strum and only adds the electronic drum. Even when there’s multiple instrumental elements or vocal effects on songs like “Sober II (Melodrama)” or “Liability (Reprise),” it’s all restrained.

For those who wonder, a lion farm is exactly that – a farm where lions are bred. This particular farm is breeding the very rare white lion in order to create a wider and stronger genetic pool. I have had the great pleasure of holding lion cubs in my arms and feeding them with a baby bottle. The cutest experience ever! I have also had the more thrilling experience of being within a few feet of wild lions in the natural African bush and “cute” is definitely not the word that comes to mind.
At times wild lions behave just like domestic cats. They rub up against trees and make purring noises, they flop themselves lovingly all over each other, playfully catching each other’s tails. They yawn and stretch and you feel you could just reach out your hand and tickle their furry bellies. Of course if you did that you would likely not live to tell the tale. That’s because lions in the wild are just that – wild. They are fierce and unpredictable and altogether awesome. To hear a wild lion roar in the dark of the African bush is an awful thing. You feel vulnerability like never before. The correct response is fear.

Babies: A common cause of yawning worldwide.
With a newborn baby at home, you probably won't be surprised to hear I yawn a lot these days. But why do I do it? Although the answer seems obvious: "I'm tired", the question "why do we yawn" is very much unsolved.
Boredom and tiredness are the two most stereotypical reasons for yawning, but what's the connection between these two conditions? Neither explains why we yawn because we saw somebody else doing so, and there's even a good chance that simply reading this article will make you yawn - and hopefully not because you're bored! Why do we yawn? Is there a physiological reason? Or a psychological one? How about evolutionary? Why can't we control whether or not we do it?
It has been suggested, and even taught, that yawning is a response to a need for more oxygen in the brain, but this has been shown to be wrong1. But what about temperature? It could be that we yawn because the brain is getting too hot, and that yawning helps cool it down again. The cooling effect is thought to come from both the air flowing through the skull as a result of the deep breath, and by increasing the blood flow to the brain by stretching the jaw. This research so far seems promising, but this still wouldn't explain why it's contagious.

Witty dialogue depends on more than just the strength of the lines on their own, it also lays in the talents of those saying it, and Gregory La Cava hit a veritable goldmine when he decided to direct Stage Door. A few years earlier Katharine Hepburn had made a deplorable Broadway appearance in a play – "The Lake". It had shaken her and made her less confident; however she found it a great lark playing a poor actress in Stage Door – Terry Randall. Stage Door is an ensemble piece, but above all else it’s the story of Terry’s maturity from superficial aspirant actress to the real thing.
The aforementioned witty dialogue is spread among all the girls in the boarding house. Ginger Rogers gives my favourite performance of hers [although, that’s not saying much] as Terry’s loquacious room-mate. Sure I’m a national of Katharine Hepburn country, but the film is an ensemble in every sense of the word.

I made the decision to stop reading that blog a long time ago because its author is steeped in bile, vitriol and contempt.

Hovering in midair above the fan was a large multi-colored beach ball. The beach ball is kept in place by Bernoulli‘s Principle, which states that air that is moving at a high speed has lower pressure than still air. The air moves around the ball to create a pocket of low-pressure air. When the ball moves to the side of the pocket, it will be pushed back in, and the upward force from the air stream keeps the ball aloft. It is a neat trick that some recognize from their junior high physics class, or a children‘s science museum.

It provides cost savings to all Californians through improved human health and productivity, lower cost building operations, and resource efficiency. Most importantly, it moves us closer to a sustainable future.
As part of West Hollywood's Vision 20/20, the City stated its commitment to protecting and facilitating a healthy environment.
In 2003, West Hollywood asked its residents and businesses what policies the updated General Plan should include. An overwhelming number of respondents concluded that green building should be a core principle of West Hollywood's General Plan.
74% of participants thought it was appropriate to give incentives, such as increased density and building height, for developments that incorporate green building practices.
91% of participants strongly agreed that the City should incorporate green building techniques into its own capital improvement programs and operations in order to minimize the consumption of natural resources and reduce pollution.
Recent studies show that the construction and maintenance of buildings are responsible for 40% of energy use in the U.S. as Americans spend 90% of their time indoors. Research also shows that indoor air quality is poor in over 30% of buildings. Thus, the opportunity for green building to reduce energy use and improve indoor air quality cannot be overlooked or ignored.

That depends entirely upon who is throwing the ball. Not factoring in wind conditions, quarterbacks like Brett Favre, Jeff George, and John Elway probably could throw it up to 80 yards at their peak. There was a QB in the 50's who supposedly could throw it 100 yards, but this is only a rumor and not based on fact. The commercials in which Michael Vick supposedly throws the ball 120 yards are entirely false. That is impossible.
Bo Jackson, in college, reportedly threw a football from one end zone to the other.
In a college QB competition, QB Joe Flacco (then at the University of Delaware, later with the Baltimore Ravens) recorded an 81 yard throw.
In 1997 Kansas State QB Michael Bishop threw one 93 yards in practice.
As part of a scouting combine, LSU QB Jamarcus Russell threw the ball about 85 yards, which is phenomenal (keep in mind that he is 6' 6" and about 260 lbs).
In competitive football, the length of the throw is not measured, but rather the length of the play, so there is no official record for Longest Throw. A distance of 80-90 yards (73-82 m) seems to be considered the longest.

Do falling objects drop at the same rate (for instance a pen and a bowling ball dropped from the same height) or do they drop at different rates? I know a feather floats down very slowly but I would think a heavy object would fall faster than a light object. Thanks for your help. I have a bet on this one.
If no air resistance is present, the rate of descent depends only on how far the object has fallen, no matter how heavy the object is. This means that two objects will reach the ground at the same time if they are dropped simultaneously from the same height. This statement follows from the law of conservation of energy and has been demonstrated experimentally by dropping a feather and a lead ball in an airless tube.
When air resistance plays a role, the shape of the object becomes important. In air, a feather and a ball do not fall at the same rate. In the case of a pen and a bowling ball air resistance is small compared to the force a gravity that pulls them to the ground. Therefore, if you drop a pen and a bowling ball you could probably not tell which of the two reached the ground first unless you dropped them from a very very high tower.

How long does it take to revive a soft tennis ball?
Why do professional tennis matches change the balls so often?
What about pressureless tennis balls?
Can I return the product and get a refund if it doesn’t work for me?
Tennis balls are manufactured from a rubber compound and have an internal pressure of around 14psi or 1kg/cm2. The rubber compound however is slightly porous and so the pressure escapes over time. This results in an increasingly soft ball with decreased bounce.
To counteract this, new tennis balls are sold in pressurized containers. Once the container is opened, the balls slowly start to lose their pressure, and therefore their bounce.
PressureBall is essentially a reusable version of the pressure can that new tennis balls come in. PressureBall stops new tennis balls going flat, indefinitely. Because the tube can be pressurised to a higher level than the internal pressure of a ball, it will also revive soft balls.
To keep your tennis balls bouncing like new tennis balls should be stored at 14 psi.
If you’ve seen some people quote “2 atm” or “27 psi” or “27.4 psi” don’t be concerned – they’re quoting a scientific measurement of air pressure when compared to a vacuum. But pump gauges don’t measure air that way. On any pump that has a gauge, you’ll want the air pressure to read 14 psi for storing tennis balls, as this is the correct pressure. The short explanation is that 14 psi on a gauge means the air inside is 14 psi more

Of course this raises the question of just how fast you would have to throw a ball for it to never fall back down. Put another way, could you throw a ball so fast that it would escape the Earth’s gravitational pull forever?
In practice the answer to this question is fairly complicated, because things like air resistance would slow the ball down, and calculating the air resistance of a ball depends on its speed, the density of air, etc. But we can calculate the speed for the hypothetical case where we only need to overcome gravity. In that case the answer is really simple. It is just the square root of the planet’s surface gravity times its diameter.
In the case of the Earth, the surface gravity is about 9.8 m/s, and its diameter is about 12.7 million meters, so if we multiply these numbers together and take the square root, we get a speed of about 11 km/s (or about 25,000 mph). This is known as the escape velocity. At that speed, the ball would have enough energy to overcome the Earth’s gravitational pull.
Since the surface gravity depends on mass and size, you can actually calculate the escape velocity of a (spherical, non-rotating) planet or star simply by knowing its mass and radius. The escape velocity increases for a larger mass or a smaller radius. For

If you talk to him for very long you can tell she makes him want to be a better man, she makes him want to do more with his life. I knew him in college. He was funny and well-liked but a bit of a drifter— now he’s dead focused on a mission and he’s pouring his life into helping other people.
I watch this couple and I wonder if I inspire others the way she inspires him. Do I inspire my own husband to be his best self? Or do I frustrate and discourage him in a world already filled with obstacles?
It’s so easy to be a downer, to always see the obstacles and the impossibility of a situation. Honestly, I think a lot of times I’m quick to tell my husband to quit. I tell him it’s too hard or not worth the time and money. I tell him not to try, not to take the risk.

I intend to bring you information each week that will be of great value and inspiration and will help you through this time as “gracefully” as possible.
And since I haven’t been in touch in awhile, I thought I would start out by explaining my concept of a “graceful” divorce. I mean, really, most people hear the word “graceful” and “divorce” and wonder how those two words can be used in the same sentence (the same universe one person commented!), much less next to each other.
Here’s what I want you to know. Divorce is never an easy thing to go through, but it can be done better than it’s been done in the past when you approach it from a mature, thoughtful, and intentional place. And that, in itself, is not easy to do when you are in the throes of ending a significant relationship, but it can be done and it is being done every day.
For most of us, this means being informed about our options, taking the time to get clear on how we want to go through the process, and taking our time to formulate ideas about how we want our life to look in a year or five years down the road. This is how a graceful divorce can be accomplished.

Every person you work with or cross paths with is a potential connection. Keeping up with these people and maintaining friendly working relationships is key for networking purposes, especially when you need references. Thus, should you ever leave your company (perhaps for another job), it is vital that your exit is graceful. You always want to leave your job on good terms in order to maintain those professional relationships. Here are a few tips for how YOU can make that GRACEFUL exit.
Give plenty of notice: A two-week’s notice is generally viewed as the standard “heads up” time frame you should give before you actually leave. However, two weeks is actually the BARE MINIMUM. As soon as you’ve made up your mind to leave, tell your bosses and co-workers. The more time you give means more time for the company to begin the transition process and find a replacement, which is always appreciated.
Write thank you notes to your supervisor and closest co-workers: A hand-written thank you letter is a very thoughtful, personal touch. Leaving notes with your boss and work friends is a nice gesture. Even if you’re leaving because of conflicts with others, be gracious with everyone when you head out. Thank them for their guidance and for being a part of your team.

Eric, if you think http://libertarianmajority.net/libertarian-polling is just stuff that I've made up, then you obviously haven't even looked at that page. It's nothing but a compilation of polling data from sources like Gallup, Zogby, Rasmussen , the Pew Research Center, the American National Election Studies, and the University of Michigan’s Center for Political Studies. All these data sources validate the Nolan Chart's model of the American electorate, and using words like "hokum" won't change the data.
You say that the Greens' agenda is popular, but of course its popularity is going to be primarily limited to voters in the left/liberal Nolan quadrant. The LP could advocate a smaller-government agenda that would probably be at least as popular with the voters in our **otherwise-unoccupied** quadrant, but instead we push a zero-government agenda. The results speak for themselves.
I nevertheless agree with all your comments to Jeff, and agree that the only realistic goal for the LP over the next 15-25 years is to drive issues and tip elections rather than win legislative majorities. I just think that we would be much more effective at driving issues if we tried to speak for the 13% to 20% of Americans who are lessarchists, rather than for just the ~1% of Americans who either don't know or don't mind that voting LP could be interpreted as endorsing anarchism.

The cults were developed and many associations can be seen because of the interconnection between the essentials for the living. Pretty much hopeful, everything that made life possible was considered as god and goddess in Ancient Egypt.
Atum's name is thought to be derived from the verb tm which means to complete or finish. Thus he has been interpreted as being the "complete one" and also the finisher of the world, which he returns to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle.
The ancient Egyptians visualized their deities in many ways, and while anthropomorphic gods and goddesses represented only one of the major forms that deities took in ancient Egyptian culture, the sub-category was broad and encompassed several different types.

This progenitor later merged his essence with a massive computer network and became known as Complex-Complex. Over the span of centuries, the ruthlessly aggressive, though intellectually stilted Citadelians took control of world after world beginning with Okaara. Because of a ban on the Vega System imposed by the Guardians of the Universe, the Citadel was allowed a free hand in its expansive goals without interference by the Green Lantern Corps.
Various dictators arose to power during the Citadel's reign, but Complex-Complex was always the true power. Such rulers included Lord Damyn, Komand'r and the opportunistic Earth human Harry Hokum.

But alas! very soon the fine bloom upon these first ripe fruits is removed by the rough handling of the surrounding world: the sensitive plant of young piety turns into a willow in after life, too pliant, too easily yielding. It is sadly true, that even a Christian may grow by degrees so callous, that the sin which once startled him does not alarm him in the least. By degrees men get familiar with sin. The ear in which the cannon has been booming will not notice slight sounds. At first a little sin startles us; but soon we say, "Is it not a little one?" Then there comes another, larger, and then another, until by degrees we begin to regard sin as but a little ill; and then follows an unholy presumption: "We have not fallen into open sin. True, we tripped a little, but we stood upright in the main. We may have uttered one unholy word, but as for the most of our conversation, it has been consistent." So we palliate sin; we throw a cloak over it; we call it by dainty names. Christian, beware how thou thinkest lightly of sin. Take heed lest thou fall by little and little. Sin, a little thing? Is it not a poison? Who knows its deadliness?

As we say in meet day preparations, we want athletes to arrive 30-60 minutes before their scheduled starting time. This gives them time to warm up and gives coaches an opportunity to see who is there so 2-person relay teams can be formed.
A Hokum Karem is a "relay" style cross country race. There will be a 1 km loop and an exchange zone that the athletes will enter from the back and leave from the front. The exchange is a simple "high-5 / tag your teammate" and the next runner runs their loop.

It’s often very appropriate to talk about franchising in terms of transmedia storytelling, but as I understood the concept in my reading of your work in Convergence Culture, I felt that transmedia storytelling represented a kind of aesthetically ideal case of franchising, where every element is designed to work together in a coordinated, coherent, integral way, without elements that seem unimportant to an overarching story. Often, a way to do this is to ensure that your franchise is being guided by a strong authorial, editorial, or managerial vision. I may be reading what you originally wrote a bit strictly, and I really love how you have since extended the concept to account for a greater range of multiplicity—where one-off interpretations and “what if?” spins on the franchise still make an integral contribution to the whole through their unique take on the formula. I’m not always sure that creation under a centralized vision is the most interesting or ideal, so I think that acknowledging the pleasures of multiplicity and divergent interpretations really enhances our understanding of transmedia storytelling.
But where I think transmedia storytelling cannot fully account for the full range of franchising is in the inherent messiness of franchising and its push away from integrated forms of collaboration. I think that all transmedia storytelling is a form of franchising, but not all franchising manages to count as transmedia storytelling. The industrial

Coogler and company have established Wakanda — a hyper-advanced society due to its stores of the near-magical metal Vibranium — as a marvel of production design, bringing organic life to its dense history and traditions. Hidden from outsiders, the country is portrayed as a beautiful mix of nature and technology, having resisted sharing its wonders — and opening its borders — for fear of unsettling its peace and prosperity.
Like Wonder Woman, moreover, the Black Panther/T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the leader of the fictional African nation Wakanda, is not only super, but royalty, about to ascend the throne that he has inherited from his father.

It's easy to see why Marvel might want to leave a third Guardians movie alone for a while; the series has been so identified with Gunn that any future installment will raise the specter of his dismissal and resurrect discussion over whether or not the studio made the right decision in dismissing him over years-old posts on social media. The idea of simply abandoning the series altogether has almost certainly been discussed, although likely swiftly discarded considering how successful earlier installments have been and how beloved the characters are. But what if there was some way for Marvel to continue the movie series without all the baggage of the Guardians brand?

Retrieved Text: The 60s, 70s and 80s were remarkable years for Marvel Comics. They gained a well deserved reputation as a major storytelling company and, with it, financial success. The comics they produced told unique tales and contained fantastic artwork, which attracted many fans, both locally and internationally. By the 1980s, comic books had become collector’s items, and many people would invest in more than one copy of the same edition, with the hope of reselling them for a small fortune at a later date. Marvel produced special editions to appeal to these customers, such as those that had the covers foil embossed, or printed using other flashy techniques. The company’s sales continued to grow until the early 90s, but by 1996 they had declined by 70%, due to higher prices and a decrease in the collectors’ market.
The company had been expanding over the years, and Marvel Productions was responsible for releasing cartoons based on the comics. In 1995, another branch of production, Marvel Studios, was formed. In the late 90s, several movies that had been adapted from Marvel Comics successfully played on the big screen. The movies had been released under other major production companies, however, and Marvel received little commission for each.
In 2003, the company carried a business proposal to Merrill Lynch that would provide them with the means of producing movies under their own label, thus receiving the majority of the profits. By 2005, the contract was signed, and included a clause that gave over the rights of their major characters to Merrill Lynch if

“The timeline has been pushed out,” says a source. Disney never set a release date for Guardians 3.
The film was originally slated to begin filming this either coming January or February, with pre-production set to begin in the fall. THR says that a chunk of the crew was already gearing up for pre-production but have since been dismissed and told to look for new work in the meantime. Last we heard, Gunn’s final meeting with Marvel was very civil and that some sources were very keen on Disney using the director’s script.

Last week, I was one of the 16,000 attendees dancing the night away at the Van Halen concert that concluded the combined ASUG and SAP SAPPHIRE 2012 events in Orlando, Florida. While the lifestyle of an SAP professional is quite different than that of a rock star, there are five things that aspiring SAP rock stars can learn from real ones like Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and David Lee Roth. Here’s my thoughts, which I also shared on the SAP Community blog.
The first thing we can learn from a real rock star like Eddie Van Halen is to always deliver your best performance with a smile. Prior to the concert, I was highly skeptical that a fifty seven year old artist could perform with the same virtuosity he had shown 30 years earlier. But not only did Eddie create a fantastic guitar performance, he did it with a smile. He seemed to be fully engaged, catching the magic moment. An SAP rock star should always maintain a positive and even temperament, even when dealing with loud-mouthed annoying co-workers like David Lee Roth.
During the concert, vintage album covers and photographs scrolled across the large video screen behind the band. They were a reminder of past rock-and-roll glories and made even this blogger reminisce fondly back to the year 1984. A real rock star can continue to have a successful career reliving past glories, performing 30-year-old hits, and recreating their guitar solos

The concert line-up features four of the biggest names in pop, hip-hop and R&B – all of whom are chart-topping, multi-platinum, Grammy Award nominees and winners.
First up is American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, whose self-titled album has sold more than a million copies. Sparks will be followed by hip-hop icon LL Cool J, with more than 15 million records sold and 20 singles on the Billboard charts. Then comes British songstress Natasha Bedingfield, with album sales of more than 10 million – and Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Famers, The O’Jays.
The concert series spotlights Universal Orlando’s new home for hit music – the Music Plaza. Located in the heart of the Universal Studios theme park, the Music Plaza debuted during Universal’s Mardi Gras event earlier this year. It is a state-of-the-art outdoor music venue designed in the spirit of one of the most famous outdoor concert venues of all-time, The Hollywood Bowl. The Music Plaza features a 2,400-square-foot performance stage, a 15,000-square-foot viewing lawn and two 20-foot-tall projection screens so that everyone can see the show.

Reason why this concert was awesome: AB came with us. It was his first rock concert.
Part of me was worried beforehand that NSAH and I would be the oldest people there, and AB would be the youngest person there. Neither was true. I saw lots of kids in attendance, the youngest of which was probably 1 1/2. AB behaved very well. Much better than the shitfaced girls who sat near us (although I don't begrudge them, because their dancing kept AB very entertained).
Didn't even consider bringing ALB along. Heck, we only brought AB because he's a big fan of Pete Yorn, and he likes Guster, too. He even picked up a new favorite Pete song last night, "Good Advice."
* As opposed to the man from Jersey or the guys from Jersey.
Oh, I'm SOOOO jealous. I love the guys from Mass! I went to college with them. OK, so maybe I went to said college a few years before they even got there. But our feet walked the same paths to the same dining halls, so that has to count for something.
Sounds like a really fun evening.

Mexico which had virtually shut down many aspects of community gatherings beginning May 1-6 th actually reopened the same a day earlier than expected in light of significant evidence substantiating that the flu was much milder and less contagious than originally spun by the US media a few weeks earlier.
Mexico may have been its own worse enemy when prematurely reporting up to 1600 cases of “swine-flu” and perhaps 150 deaths, which later turned out to be unverifiable. Indeed, when the cases/corpses were later examined by US labs, it was determined that only 19 had died and of the 800+ cases, almost everyone recovered when treated properly.
WHO also acknowledged that the flu was now worldwide and that restricting travel served little purpose but to disrupt global activity, and imposing travel restrictions would be fruitless.
However, you can bet that the San Diego, and LA press will continue to push for travel restrictions by perpetuating the “chicken little” hogwash fallacy, as tens of millions in cruise ship revenues continue to pour into their communities creating an economic windfall as travelers spend their travel dollars in US ports rather than their original Mexican destinations.

I was making a rack of ribs for dinner and a nice rosé was in order. I spotted the Hogwash Rosé in the meger winter selection of Rosé wine at my local QFC supermarket. The pig on the label jumped out at me and sometimes that’s all it takes to take a chance.
So out of the bottle and into the glass….The color is pink to peach with a slight light orange and cranberry hue. Very clean and bright.
The nose is full of berries with strawberries being front and center. A touch of vanilla and lavender with a slight sweet musky note as well.
On tasting, watermelon and strawberries were my first impression with a slight slate (minerally) finish that was a little short but pleasant but a little on the acidic side. The wine is sweet and it’s lower alcohol (12.9%) makes this a very easily drinkable wine to accompany BBQ, picnic meals and other food associated with summertime. Overall it’s a decent Rosé but nothing spectacular. I’d drink it again but not search it out.

An elegant old lady degenerates into flailing madness. A beggar counts small change on Westminster Bridge. Hot summer afternoons transform into autumn and winter days and back to summer again. At first, Iris and Rachel are linked only by their illness, but as they heal they grow closer, and soon they are enmeshed in a relationship neither can escape. When Iris insists on writing Rachel’s biography, the younger woman is unable to resist; but is her life being reported or created by her self-appointed storyteller?

Retrieved Text: Atrial flutter (AFL) is an abnormal heart rhythm that occurs in the atria of the heart. When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate or tachycardia (230–380 beats per minute), and falls into the category of supra-ventricular tachycardias. While this rhythm occurs most often in individuals with cardiovascular disease (eg: hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy), it may occur spontaneously in people with otherwise normal hearts. It is typically not a stable rhythm, and frequently degenerates into atrial fibrillation (AF). However, it does rarely persist for months to years.
Atrial flutter was first identified as an independent medical condition in 1920 by the British physician Sir Thomas Lewis (1882-1945) and colleagues.

At the beginning of the story, Felicita grieves over the death of her friend, Ilven, who jumped off a cliff to escape living in a royal house where she is told what to do and whom to marry. Felicita decides she does not want to live this life either and runs away into the town to live as a pauper. She befriends a group of degenerates, who live off of little and consider each other family since they do not have any original family of their own. Using magic and the sea, the group tries to get revenge on the royal houses, killing many villagers, Felicita’s brother, and almost Felicita herself.
This novel includes many risqué elements and is difficult to follow. There are many different royal houses and lots of made-up language, making the text unclear. The story lacks character development—some characters are meant to remain “mysterious,” but this only makes the book more confusing. For example, Dash, the head of the degenerates that Felicita befriends, has an erratic personality. Some days he is sweet and caring towards is housemates, while at other times he goes missing and has bouts of anger for no reason. The author does not elaborate on his past or why he acts this way. Additionally, Felicita originally leaves her royal home because she does not want to be married off, yet in the end she

Gold Ambush seems like an interesting blend of genres that tries to give something to everyone: if you like city builders, you got a city builder, and if you like (almost) endless runners, you got that too. If you haven’t read the details on the game when we wrote about it last month, in Gold Ambush you build your castle and then fortify it using all kinds of traps. When you get raided by other players, you can return the favor and try and see if you can overcome their traps first.

Information from our legal team is still filtering through, so we’ll be sure to keep you posted as the fine print is digested and can be translated into something that makes sense to everyone.
The first of these changes is the introduction of a new role available for any future trusts that you might be looking to set up. This role is called the ‘controller’, and does exactly as it suggests.
The idea being, that this third party can veto or approve any changes to the structure that the trustee may wish to make. Such changes could include adding or removing any of the beneficiaries, adjusting the vesting date, or, editing the trust deed. This gives better control over the structure, particularly in the unfortunate circumstances of it being examined in court.
The role is not a mandatory one, but future deeds will at least have the potential to appoint such a person. Advice to date suggests that this controller should ideally be a natural person, and a third party to the existing appointor and trustee. So, appropriate persons could include your solicitor or other professional advisor, or perhaps a trusted friend.
Even if the position will remain vacant to begin with, we do recommend that new trusts should be created with this role available so that it can be filled at

Earlier this month, I filed a Freedom of Information Act with the City of Fairmont. My goal was simply to see if this suspicion would be confirmed or denied, because people have both a right and duty to hold their government accountable to standards of decency and justice.
On Monday, November 20th, I received my copy of the Freedom of Information Act request. There were 92 pages that met my criteria, with 8 more pages the city could not release due to them being exempted under WV Code 29B. Having looked through the information I must say that my suspicions were confirmed in spectacular fashion.
There you have it folks. I presented, in very accurate detail, a list of things the city manager said that were by his own definition hateful, and what does Council member Moran think of that? That I’m idiotic, and that sharing such information (that the city manager himself had already shared publicly) is harassment. This is the new Fairmont, where dissent is hate speech and exposing hypocrisy is harassment.

Snowdrift is a collection of fourteen short stories that were published over the course of Heyer's fifty-year-long career. Most of them were previously collected in the book Pistols for Two; three were more recently discovered. Nearly all of the stories are set in the Regency period, and the book includes a short foreword by Heyer's official biographer, Jennifer Kloester.
Admittedly, there are some delightful stories in this collection, but there's just too much overlap: fully eight of them center around an unplanned meeting in an inn, an unexpected carriage ride, or some combination of the two. Why not just read the full-length novel Sylvester, which features the same plot elements, but explores them with far more depth and heart? And the remaining stories are of wildly uneven quality—ranging from sweet to straight-up unpleasant.

But despite their feelings for each other, the differences in their two very different worlds soon becomes apparent.
Director Robert Hastie shepherds the cast with skill, never shying away from the intensity and emotional impact of silence and pause in the midst of the drama; and eliciting quality performances from the cast with an unassuming ease. Jonathan Bailey (Broadchurch) and Ben Blatt (Spooks) excel in their respective performances as John and George, having a terrific on-stage chemistry and engaging in performances which were wholly absorbing, touching and brimming with genuine emotion. Brian Fletcher’s monosyllabic character of Jack brought some of the lighter moments within the piece, whilst Lesley Nicol (Downtown Abbey) brings a warm and instantly recognisable charm to her portrayal as the down to earth matriarch of the family, which is as homely as the cottage kitchen that makes up the stage.
Peter Gill’s script vacillates from fast-paced, northern humour-filled dialogue to long, silent pauses of emotional drama with ease; and is reflective of the changes in society at the time, both in terms of the progress of modern life and the beginning of a change in attitudes. There is an underlying reticence of some of the characters to move on into the modern world, which mirrors the cautious approach of John and George to

It seems surprising that there hasn’t been an adventure film like this sooner. Stroomop, which means upstream, follows the lives of five women with their own personal struggles, who join a whitewater rafting expedition. As their back stories unfold through flashbacks, we learn more about their troubles and why this getaway adventure is important to them. When things go awry, their survival instincts kick in forcing them to dig deep.
This is Ivan Botha’s directorial debut. He and DonnaLee Roberts have become a formidable duo when it comes to film-making in South Africa following favourable and relatively successful box office outings with Pad na jou Hart and Vir Altyd. Typically playing romantic comedy co-leads, Stroomop finds them on either end of the camera, delving into the realm of action adventure drama. This coming-of-age ensemble piece features a predominantly female cast, which ties in quite purposefully with Women’s Month and Day. Into the Wild followed a young adventurer on his journey of self-realisation and in a similar bent to Wild, this female-led drama brings several stories together as the expedition takes a turn for the worse.
Using flashbacks to relay the turmoil in the hearts and minds of each of these women, their stories rise to the surface as the river becomes a symbol for adversity and their emotional state. While emotive, Stroomop is much safer than it could have been, trying to speak to issues affecting

Teen-pregnancy drama had a superb run in 2005 with Derek Yee’s unassuming 2 Young, one of the year’s surprise box-office hits.
Fiona Sit and Jaycee Fong star as Nam and Fu, two Form 5 students from opposite ends of society. Nam’s a bored, rich girl with a rebellious streak, Fu’s a high-school repeater living in a cramped housing estate. When the two start dating and go on a New Year’s Eve camping trip, the girl falls pregnant. With parents on both sides not accepting the news, the pair flee their homes, secretly moving into an abandoned village house and struggling to lay the foundations for future family life.
Director Yee has a knack for capturing everyday Hong Kong life on film with involving characters and setups, whether as melodrama in Lost In Time (2003) or slipped into a thriller for One Nite In Mongkok (2004), and his 2 Young is no exception. Unforced pop drama plays out with plenty of room for characters to develop, making compelling portraits of the lovebirds’ home lives, clear reasoning behind their idealistic escape, and a side theme of parental responsibility.

In this case, Mark uses the expression "run-of-the-mill" with a negative to emphasize that Tania's engagement ring is not ordinary; due to the size of the diamond and cost of the ring, it an extraordinary ring that is not “run-of-the-mill." Using the expression in this way (with a negative to emphasize that something isn't ordinary) is fairly common.

On behalf of Michael A. Gottlieb, P.A. posted in blog on Thursday, October 19, 2017.
Law enforcement has begun cracking down on pill mills throughout Florida. The definition of a pill mill is a practice where a pharmacist or doctor dispenses prescription medication in an inappropriate and illegal manner.
Doctors should be wary of becoming involved in a pill mill. Provided here is all the basic information you need to know about this illegal practice.
Most of the time, licensed doctors do not run these mills, but there have been cases of it happening. In many cases, the doctor who runs the mill lost his or her license in another state and had to move to Florida to do business. There is an opioid epidemic occurring throughout the United States, and these drug mills play a fairly large role in its spread.
Federal law considers running a pill mill as drug trafficking. This is a felony offense and could result in the convicted party receiving life in prison. In the event the doctor at the mill operates without a license, then he or she will face charges of drug prescription without a license.
In recent years, pill mills have popped up throughout Florida and across the Appalachian mountains. This is largely due to the fact that there is minimal prescription medication monitoring in that area. These mills can bring in a lot of money through illegal revenue because the doctors at these mills can charge a ton of money for one bottle

This is still fairly typical wet-hulling, where coffee is de-pulped and then dried for a single day down to only 50%, then moved to a centralized mill in Takengon where the wet parchment is peeled and then the coffee drying is finished down to 11-12% moisture (this method is called \"Giling Basah\", and you can read Tom's article about it here.)

Saw Mill Run Watershed is one of 7 intermediate watersheds in Allegheny County. Located in the south central portion of the county, Saw Mill Run is 22 miles long, including its tributaries, with a land area of almost 20 square miles. Twelve separate and unique communities are located in the Saw Mill Run Watershed, including more than 15 City of Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
The Saw Mill Run Valley was once covered with dense forests and lush meadows. The soils in forests and meadows quickly absorb rain and snow melt, feeding the streams from the ground water table. For more than one hundred years, the communities in the Saw Mill Run Valley have grown, replacing soft absorbent soils with impervious concrete and asphalt. As a result,Saw Mill Run frequently overflows its banks, flooding nearby communities carrying pollutants and debris from the streets and land into the stream.
Improving water quality in Saw Mill Run will take a collaborative effort from: local and state governments, nonprofit organizations, local businesses, and our committed citizens. We have lots to do but we are making progress. Check back for updates on our work!

It shouldn’t be “And Joe realized that it was bad to kill people.” Those kinds of lessons should have an emotional, visceral, poetic-mythological resonance, which means they can’t simply be stated, like in expository writing.

If you're looking for a beautiful and poetic novel about the human condition, that creates literary magic out of the mundane, and that also happens to be fantasy, I have just the thing for you.
Zoe and her husband Jake are on holiday in a ski resort in the Pyrénées. They go skiing early one morning but they are caught in a snow avalanche. Miraculously, they manage to get out of the packed snow that has buried them. But when they come back to the village, the place is deserted, as if everyone has just left in a hurry.
This short teaser can't be any longer or it would be too spoilery. But it's not the mystery of the novel that makes its interest. The perspicacious reader understands quite quickly what is happening. It's the struggle of the characters, Zoe and Jake, their hopes, their sacrifices, that make of The Silent Land a very striking novel.
Graham Joyce was an amazing story teller and you can find evidence of it in each and every page: the descriptions, the actions, the characters' thoughts. As often in his novels, the depictions allie the mundane to the poetic, steeped in strangeness and fantasy. Joyce referred to his writing as "Old Peculiar" and many symbolic elements are evocative of folklore or of a larger truth, always elusive.
The relationship between Zoe and Jake is beautifully told, from the most banal moments to the most heartbreaking. They all strike true: not only you are quickly invested in the characters

A mother; still grieving for the loss of her husband who was stabbed and killed during a feud with the rival Felix family, finds her son is due to marry an ex-lover of a Felix.
But he is happy to let the past rest, for love... for now.
Set in 1930s Spain, the old feud is stirred up by rumours and whispering surrounding the marriage linking families to their turbulent warring history. The younger generation has put love above all and sets the past in the past, with plans for the future to unite and harmonise.
But when tradition and expectations are so at odds with instinct, our young bride is torn between her desire and her duty. Her subsequent actions create a ferocious chain of events which will end in an irrevocably cruel climax.

DeVotchKa’s newest full length, 100 Lovers, (officially released March 1) is a stunner of a record – expansive and wild, but perhaps their lightest and most playful record to date. Which isn’t to say the band has lost their poetic seriousness – it’s still there and quite intact in “The Alley” and “Ruthless”. But the joyous streak that runs through all of DeVotchKa’s records is a little closer to the surface, in all its heartbreaking beauty. “The Man from San Sebastian” is cinematic with a dash of post-punk (Echo & The Bunnymen-esque, even).

When Hélène has to go on a school camping trip, she dreads the isolation forced upon her by her peers, but a chance encounter with a fox changes Hélène’s outlook on life and allows her to find friendship at last.
Using the graphic novel format Britt and Arsenault have created an incredibly moving of story of overcoming bullying and loneliness. The use of colour is particularly striking and evocative; the artwork is mainly drawn in grey scale, always slightly blurry, matching Hélène’s melancholic and lonely mood, while wonderful bursts of colour illuminate the page any time something Hélène feels positive about is mentioned (Jane Eyre, the fox, her new friend). It is incredibly effective.
The link with Jane Eyre is clever and quirky, not only emphasising the power of stories in empowering people, but also highlighting that classic tales can still have resonance in our lives, with Jane Eyre’s fight for acceptance is mirrored in Hélène’s own life.

Theatre company and registered charity Imagine If was behind this production, which took us on a raw and honest journey between two young people, showing how their love for one another turned sour.
The was inspired by real life events and told the tale of a modern abusive relationship.
Set in Leeds and starring only three performers, all of whom were sensational, it grabbed me from the very start and didn’t let any of the small audience go until the very last word.
Written by Francesca Joy, who also performed the part of young Rosa, it was sassy as well as serious; humorous as well as heartbreaking.
Francesca is a fantastic actress with the sort of presence that commands your focus and her portrayal of a young girl who fell head over heels in love with Niko was completely believable.
Inseparable from the word go, their passion for one another is tested when Rosa gets a place at a university in London.
Niko ends up in prison and Rosa’s grandmother Lily is being kept completely in the dark about the sinister turn this young relationship starts to take.
Prince Plockey played unstable yet likeable Niko; a fantastic actor. His occasional poetic monologues throughout the performance were both flawless and breathtakingly impressive. He’s going places and is definitely one to watch.
This is a tale of domestic violence and the cycle of forgiveness that inevitably leads to constant repetition of disgraceful behaviour. Imagine If has toured

I bought a pass for five movies, and I selected Human Flow as my personal opening movie. Selecting a documentary also reflects my changing preference. I am less interested in romcoms and popcorn dramas, and I am intrigued by movies that will get me to think and revisit my values and stances on things. Ai Weiwei’s Human Flow certainly does that.
The documentary opens with a beautiful expanse of blue sea, with a speck of refugee boat breaking the beautiful monotony. So begins a stunning and heartbreaking poetic film, presenting the audience with facts and cases of some of the biggest humanitarian crisis that we’ve ever seen. We see the exasperation and hopelessness of the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the Eritreans, and the Kurds. I can almost see you retreating further away from the screen, or hovering over your browser – so you don’t need to read further. Whilst I consider myself as fairly compassionate and caring person, watching the documentary exposes my prejudice as well.
Some scenes show Syrians arriving on Lesvos island in Greece – immediately taking photos on their smartphones, smiling and posing. I could feel a rising disdain and judgment – surely these people are not true refugees if they can still smile, pose, and can afford mobile phones. In a split second, I was ashamed by that thought.

Set in a small, post-rural Chinese mining town, the film follows the dismal fate of a single father who’s devoted his life to the ramshackle industry, and his two adult children, both of whom are burdened with the heritage of their family’s nocuous occupation. This cross-generational angst is explored in three stories wherein we observe filial and paternal aspirations lugubriously disintegrating: The paterfamilias seeks his long-estranged wife in the unfamiliar thicket of the Internet while son and daughter simply pipedream of life elsewhere, particularly in the pop-urban embrace of a romanticized Beijing. The impending disappointments are predictable from the start, and quite conspicuously woven into the film’s pace and visual strategy; aching silences dominate most conversations (characters often face outward toward the camera, rather than at each other, to overbearingly signify a lack of intimacy), and many scenes fatalistically fade to black. And yet the stark melancholia achieves a rare authenticity, perhaps most pointedly manifested in the objective correlative of the mineshaft itself, the dismal bowels of which we only see in two brief and uneventful scenes. The family doesn’t abhor mining because it’s hazardous or arduous, but because it represents their only career option: It’s a Plutonian symbol of universal resignation. The poisonous womb of the shaft is too apt a metaphor for their domestic and romantic suffocation. The intermittent genius of

Listening to the dreamy atmospheres of “Då All Tid Försvinner” can be very a relaxing experience as the band creates magical barren folk melodies using harmonium and nylon stringed guitars with a minimalist music approach that allows the delicate vocals to spellbind the listeners.
The title track often feels like a celebration of the beauty of nature as it continues to focus on enchanting detailed melodic progressions and moving tonalities embellished by a heartfelt vocal delivery and this graceful ensemble always flows like a dream evoking feelings of loneliness and nostalgia.
Undantagsfolk are certainly inspired by ancient folk and Swedish traditions, consequently the sonic realm of “Den Ondes Fingrar” is made of sheer melancholy and soulful harmonies that naturally lead to a delightful dreamy sonic journey.
Swedish blackened folk metal band Skogen are ready to spread immense melancholy and Nordic atmospheres on the new release “Skuggorna Kallar”.
While channeling all kinds of dark nuances “Det Nordkisa Morkret” focuses mainly on melancholic soundscapes, lost in the middle of a forest on a gelid winter day, as guitars craft mellow melodies surrounded by cold heartbreaking atmospheres while blackened dynamics tend to linger in the background providing steady riffing.
“Nebula” showcases hints of hellish black metal with ominous growls but the instrumental passages tend to follow a calmer melodic approach and a sorrowful mood as graceful folk oriented acoustic phrases hold a primary role in the song’s structure.

The hit single is relatively indicative of the band’s other output. It’s light, enjoyable, and none too deep. Even more self-serious tracks like “American Daydream” came packaged with bubbly harmonies and persistent percussion. It was an album that didn’t take itself too seriously, and whether or not that pays off is up to you as a listener.
For me, the unabashedly upbeat and gleeful Mondo was a welcome release and dear to my heart. Taking its cues from Foster the People’s Torches and the similarly-digestible Matt and Kim, Mondo was easy listening and catchy enough to stay with you.
Five years later, this still rings true. The band’s late follow-up, titled Plural, is arguably less varied—and more consistent—than its predecessor. Gone are the mellow tracks a la “American Daydream”; Plural is bubblegum pop through-and-through. But here’s the thing: it’s good bubblegum pop! The vocals are solid and dreamlike, the drums come to the fore here even more so than on Mondo, and the end results are just as catchy as anything that’s come before. It’s a refreshingly consistent follow-up.
There’s nothing on here that reaches the surreal and exhilarating highs of “This Head I Hold” or the even more frantic “Waves”, but there’s still plenty of fun to be had here. As someone who unironically dives into new Matt and Kim releases, I have no issues with hearing catchy new variations

Maybe it’s because we killed the marriage so thoroughly that the break-up part is a relief.
Maybe having my heart broken (mere minutes after exiting my teenage years) was so painful that I never since put myself in the position to be heart-broken again.
There was so much sad emanating from that grown-up woman’s blog over her grown-up sad, sad break-up.
Am I wrong to find that a little immature? How many times does a person’s heart need to be broken before they stop allowing it to happen? She mentioned she had an ex-husband. Was her heart broken then too?

You see, being a strong person is great. It means you are a survivor, a victor, an overcomer. Many strong people are alone but they are hardly ever lonely because they are either planning the next big thing or fighting a new goliath to reach the next level. Many strong people tend to do life alone and no one seems to understand why that is.
The problem is people who surround strong people expect nothing less than strength from them. They expect strong people to be ‘on’ all the time, abuzz with bible verses and inspirational quotes. They expect strong people to always have something to pour out while they eagerly receive. They don’t ever expect strong people to faint or even feel faint.
But here is a fact: Strong people faint many times.
Strong people feel situations like you do. They might know all the bible verses, but when it seems like the doors of life are closing in, strong people break down and cry too. It is at times like this that they need words of encouragement, love, hugs, a treat, no pity parties but an outlet to let out the pain they feel and an encouraging verse to strengthen their hearts after they have emptied their hearts of hovering depression.
But what do people around them do instead?

Your heart rate varies all day long; these variations have many different sources. What you eat, what medications you take, whether you're at rest or exerting yourself, and what kind of stress you're experiencing, can all trigger alterations in your heart rate. If we didn't have such an adjustable pump, we would be unable to release the oxygen needed to support appropriate activity in times of danger, injury or illness so this variable heart rate is quite important in our daily lives. Trauma Triggers Heart Rate Increases When you break a bone, you're experiencing a physical trauma. The body responds to injury, stress, worry, and anxiety as it responds to fear and excitement – by activating the “fight or flight” response. On the chemical level, your body releases a series of hormones that make you hyper-alert, focused, and energized. This chemical release triggers increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and perspiration. Though this "fight or flight" response is appropriate and useful when you can fight or fly, when you break a bone, or suffer many other severe traumas to your physical person, fighting and escaping are often not possible.

I am exhausted of trying to munch on a crappy burger to get some health! Those mini gunners are instakillers! I think we need a Doctor mode or a Doctor rank! Or just a healing gun! We have our stun guns! What about the ultimate medical treatment while in combat! Self injections of a morphine injector that does 1.5 heart per injection! But uh oh don’t O.D, because after your second one your can start to feel a little nauseated and even even have a reverse effect to where you will lose 2.5 hearts till death! So you better keep count! And for your doctors who use the medic gun does 1 heart and can only hit you 5 times but after that it will do no further help can be given till out and into the next fight! But hope they have a good aim because you don’t want your enemy to get a dose if morphine from your Medic on the field! Stay active, keep voting, and remain friendly!

Maybe the person you have lived with, or even a person you have had children with. It can be a real kick in the teeth. A veritable shock to the system to suddenly find yourself alone and feeling like the world is caving in on us. And that constant sharp pain in your chest? Surely your heart is trying to tear its way out of your body.
You’re heartbroken, and the pain is greater than anything you have ever experienced. You find it difficult to concentrate on anything but this great gaping hole in your chest. And you can’t eat, you can’t sleep, you can’t even force yourself to think about anything else. Finally, you just want the pain to end, but how? Now that you’ve lost the person who meant so much to you. How can that pain ever go away? Without him or her in your life, how can you ever fill that great empty void in your heart where they used to be? How can you overcome a broken heart?
In other words, avoid things that are sure to renew the pain. Sure, the pain is inside you. It is a constant presence in your head and heart that you cannot escape. Still, there are certain things that you shouldn’t do if you want to avoid inflicting more pain on yourself. Many people strongly believe that avoiding

Everyone has a limit. Once you go beyond the limit then "Another one bites the dust". Here the characteristics of elasticity under stressful conditions is used to describe her own behavior in a bad relationship.
The song opens with a few words that sets the tone for many. This phrase means to break, to fail or to give out. In other words, another relationship has failed or didn’t work out. It sounds like this is a reoccurring situation.
This song can be of more than one interpretation. Of course, this song gives the impression of a couple breaking up. Her skin is thick and she has an elastic heart, her partner can never break her. This love is ending, but she will still fight for herself and for her peace. She is becoming fed up with him, and his red flags (bad signs) makes her not trust him as well as anyone else.
To a point, this song gives another impression as inner strength for ones more deeper and personal reasons that doesn't directly need to mean breakups or relationships. It can be gaining inner strength from someone in whichever part of life who swallowed her whole, and left her feeling lost and hopeless; but by having thick skin and an elastic heart, she won't be down too long, and will come back up fighting for herself and inner peace.
Red flags symbolize warnings of danger. How many of us here wanted a relationship so bad that even if

First, you save a TON of money by staying at home instead of paying for an expensive vacation. This is likely such a huge amount of money that you could give yourself a shopping spree over spring break and treat yourself without guilt!
By staying at home for break, you’ll finally get to relax. While going on vacation can be relaxing as well, the stress of planning and organizing is very real. Take that much-needed time for yourself and just enjoy eating and sleeping like you’re not able to in college.
Most importantly, home time means family time!! Yes, family can get on our nerves at times, but a week or so of quality time with them is an opportunity to really bond and catch up with them. If anything, they will appreciate you spending quality time with them more than anything.
Take spring break as an opportunity to spend time with old friends, family, and yourself. You will see your college friends after break, and that time apart from them can help your relationship with them. After all, absence makes the heart grow fonder.

Foods like those rich in vitamin C. Foods rich in vitamin C include: cherries, corn, nectarines, rhubarb, snap beans and tomatoes. Ruby red grapefruits are also heart healthy because eating one a day can reduce your "bad" cholesterol. These summer foods are easy to prepare and are great tasting raw.
Red berry fruits like bilberry, chokeberry and elderberry have been used to cure many diseases. Recently researchers of Indiana School of Medicine in Fort Wayne Indiana discovered that the extracts from these berries have a positive effect on coronary arteries of porcupines.
They have similar physiology to humans so this could be good news. Heart disease is one of those slow-building over a lifetime of bad habit diseases that tends to sneak up on its victims. Heart disease strikes when you least expect it and against people who think it cant happen to them.
Bad habits become part of your lifestyle to the extent that you think little of how your activity level, or smoking habits, even your eating style or what you eat elevates your risk for heart disease. Take control of your heart health by increasing your fruit and vegetables in your daily diet.
Most of us do not have at least 5 servings of fruits and

Busy Season in book , officially opens on the first part of Spring Break at colleges. Whether you are a student at Savannah College of Arts and Design , College of Charleston in Charleston South Carolina, or one of the many other colleges scattered all over the states of Georgia and South Carolina, when moving time comes, it comes quick.
What is the biggest headache with moving for Spring Break? Lack of planning would be it. Last year we received close to 30 calls in two days from parents and students looking for movers or even a truck last minute. It breaks my heart to hear the frustration in their voice, I can here leases having to be extended another month, moms and dads arguing in the back ground or the snap of a college kids face when they realize that maybe they are smarter than Mom and Dad.
Do not wait to the last minute. Movers book up fast.Make sure you have a confirmed email reservation and call 2 days before and the day before just to reconfirm. The amount of traffic these moving companies see at these times of year can be overwhelming. It never hurts to make sure. Also make sure you researched these movers, try Yelp and Google to make sure that the movers do not have

I am going to try again with the hopes that this time my words will express how much this book made me feel, how many times I cried, how many times I had white knuckles clutching my kindle wondering what was going to happen with Chase. I don’t want to spoil anything, because this book was one of my most anticipated reads for this year and it blew away any expectations I had because it was so much better than I could have ever imagined it to be.
My heart broke for Chase in the previous book and I knew when starting Eulogy that he was going to break it more and he did. The emotions, the pain, that feeling of never being good enough when you have given your soul to someone had my emotions all over the place. I physically felt my stomach in knots, my heart aching and a darkness settle over my mind, it was as I felt how Chase was feeling like I was in his body. He has blood on his hands and vengeance in his heart and trying to stop him may cost you your life. He is no longer than fun loving Chase we fell in love with, he is dark, angry, hurt, and broken but this new side of him it’s always been there but now
