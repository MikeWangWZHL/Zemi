Stage times are approximate, and sometimes bands go on later than the time given. Advertise the time given. We reward bands that have their crowd come early and stay late to support the other bands on the bill. It is also expected that bands play the entire set start time to at least 2:00am (1:45am on Saturdays) with no more than 2 (5-10 minute) breaks.
All bands are paid after the show. If you play longer that will be taken into account when being paid and may result in a bonus, but the same applies in the opposite end of the spectrum if you cut the set short pay may be deducted and future shows held in question.

The band is called ‘In Silence’. Not a common name I think for a metal band. When I translate it in Dutch it means ‘not much noise’ but I think there is some noise in your songs. Can you tell me something about the name.
We didn’t start with this name. Before ‘In Silence’ became the official name we had a different name. But our bassist Mikael came up with this name one night while we were sitting together and had a couple of beers. And it just felt right, it’s original and easy to remember.
Can you tell me something about the early years of the band? When is the band established? Who came up with the idea? And how did it started?
‘In Silence’ started about three years ago with Sebastian, Mikael, Erika and Rasmus. Daniel came to the band at the end of summer 2018.
We all had played in different bands before, but it didn’t feel right. We met each other and talked. So we decided to start ‘In Silence’ and it felt right from the minute we started.
Can you tell something more about the band members? With instruments they play, musical backgrounds etc?
On vocals we have Erika (Rejka) Jonsson. She is the crazy, energetic person in our band. She has gone to the “Nordic Rock

What types of instruments make up a marching band?
Have you ever been to a high school or college football game? If you have, you were probably treated to a show at halftime. In addition to the gridiron action, many people look forward to seeing a unique act that combines music with movement. What are we talking about? The marching band, of course!
A marching band puts music into motion. Marching band members play a wide variety of instruments. Rather than sitting in a chair, though, marching band members play their instruments while they march and sometimes even dance.
Choreographers coordinate the movements of band members to create a moving piece of art that's a feast for the eyes. Marching bands also often include other performers, including dancers or color guard groups, who carry or twirl flags or other items and dance to tell a story that goes along with the music.
Most marching bands contain a variety of instruments, including brass, woodwinds and percussion. Some instruments you're likely to see in a marching band include flutes, clarinets, saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and drums.
Marching bands have been around a long, long time. Their origins can be traced back to traveling musicians who played at festivals thousands of years ago. The first true marching bands, though, were military bands.
Long ago, armies did not have the sophisticated communications devices that exist today. Early military groups used bands to help organize and direct the movements of troops on the battlefield. Musical instruments helped to

In another example of a great article in my local paper that I can’t find free online (but you can pay for it at the LA Times site), “Rock’s Future” by Robert Hilburn of the LA Times discusses the renaissance of my favourite term “retro rock” focusing on the success of Jack White of the White Stripes. One quote I found interesting was Little Steven’s opinion that “classic rock started with Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” and ended with the suicide of Kurt Cobain.” He feels that new bands like the White Stripes and the Vines and The Hives are reconnecting with this “classic rock” and moving away from the “one dimensional anger and aggression of late-‘90s bands whose game plan was to simply exaggerate the legitimate disillusionment and assault of such great early ‘90s groups as Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails.” Of course, the main focus of the article seems to be on bands signed to major labels as opposed to the indies but the point is well taken. And for people complaining that “If these new bands are so good why don’t they sell more?” Hilburn rightly points out that the times are changing and it is much harder for any “alt-rock” band to get the exposure today that someone like Nirvana got in the early ‘90s. He concludes by stating that bands like the White Stripes can play an important role in keeping rock and roll alive even if they don’t get the massive exposure, much like The

Am 20. April erschien das neue From Ashes To New Album "The Future". Wir haben Sänger und Gitarrist Matt ein paar Fragen zu Band, Album und Deutschland gestellt.
Matt: We are doing great! The new record is out and we are receiving amazing feedback. Busy times ahead!
What’s the meaning behind the title of the album “The Future”?
Matt: As with everything we do, it holds multiple meanings. The biggest meaning is knowing that we should let go of our past and focus on what lies ahead. The future is very important to us as a species, so we should use our past to learn and help shape it.
And the message behind your new single “Crazy”?
Matt: There are many times in life that we have something that is not good for us, but we continue going back to it. The song tells the story about how situations like this drive us crazy.
Describe your band in 3 words!
Which bands/musicians have influenced the style (sound and lyrics) of “The Future”?
Matt: This list could go for days, but I’ll try to keep it short. For me, I’m influenced a lot by; Eminem, Breaking Benjamin, Of Mice & Men, Linkin Park, and a ton of other artists from other genres.
Is there a city you would love to play in? – if so, why this city?
Matt: I would love to play any city in Australia. We have been all over the world, but we are yet to visit Australia.

This seems like a no-brainer, but the answer may surprise you. Many hiring managers simply assume that all temp workers are looking for full-time employment. That’s not always the case. Some people prefer the variety that comes with temp work, while others may be holding out for a different full-time opportunity.
2. Are they comfortable in a long-term role?
A temp worker may have worked in a wide variety of short-term positions before coming to your company. Before offering them a permanent position, make sure they feel comfortable committing to a position that can last for years.
3. Why did they choose temp work in the first place?
Many people assume that all temp workers are looking for a permanent position. However, some people prefer the flexibility and freedom of short-term assignments. They may have personal obligations that can make a long-term schedule problematic. Finding out why they chose temp work in the first place can alert you to reasons they may not fit into a permanent role.
4. Why do they want to leave temp work?

Your ability to negotiate your salary with a temp agency relies on knowing how they make their money. The basic rule is that temp agencies charge the employer a certain rate per hour for each worker, and then keep a certain percent of that fee (usually 25 to 50 percent) while paying the worker the remaining amount. Fees are determined by the type of project and the skills required for each position.
Determine the bill rate that the temp agency is charging the employer for your work. Ask your recruiter from the agency to provide you with this information. If they will not, check with the human resources department at the company itself. If you still are unable to get the information, assume that the temp agency is making the 25 to 50 percent margin over what you are paid.
Research what the going market rate is for the position. You can do this by visiting Salary.com (see Resources) and entering information about the job title, location and your skill level. Print the results and keep this information handy as you move ahead with negotiations.
Update your resume with information that highlights your experience and skills related to the position. This will give you leverage in explaining to the agency why you qualify for a higher rate.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, average weekly staffing employment totaled 3.4 million workers, according to a report by the American Staffing Association.
Specifically within the legal industry, however, there are emerging alternatives like project work for lawyers that provide better benefits than using traditional temp firms to fill the needed gaps in your practice. The article below discusses why temp firms have become unsustainable in the new legal market, and why hiring lawyers on a project-basis is now a better alternative for many law practices.
The most unsustainable aspect of temp firms is inherent in its name - the services are temporary! This creates many problems and risks that other short-term hiring methods avoid, including creating an in-cohesive work environment and utilizing unmotivated temp workers who provide low-quality work. Essentially, outsiders are coming into your firm and disrupting the day-to-day workflow for a period of time. If you use temp firms for multiple matters over a period of time, it is not guaranteed that you will receive the same temp workers that completed work for the firm previously. The subject-matter expertise and quality of work is inconsistent, which produces inconsistent work product.

Temporary employment agencies -- popularly known as temp agencies -- provide workers to a variety of businesses via short-term contracts or indefinite temporary positions. From the employers' point of view, temp agencies perform many of the duties of a company's human resources department, but may be able to do so more efficiently and have access to a wider applicant pool. Workers see temp agencies as a place that will put in the effort to place them in a job, even in a difficult job market. Plus, a temp job can be a foot in the door that leads to a permanent position.
Sometimes, temp agencies are seen as a last resort, a place for unskilled workers to find low-wage jobs. However, today there are temp agencies that specialize in providing highly skilled contract workers in fields like medicine, technology, publishing and engineering. These agencies provide flexibility for both employers and employees.
Temp agencies have their critics, however. They see temp agencies as cost-cutting measures that allow companies to use workers without providing vacation time, health insurance or other benefits. This practice, they say, contributes to the erosion of job security in modern job markets.
Though they have both pros and cons, temp agencies are a major part of the world's job market, especially in the U.S., where more than two million Americans were employed by temp agencies as of 2004 [U.S. Dept. of Labor]. Employment with temp agencies peaked in 2006 before suffering declines due to the economic downturn

Retrieved Text: If you ask the question of how to find a temp position, there are plenty of options available in every city. Searching with recruitment agencies and staffing agencies are a good start, especially while some of these work specifically for temporary positions. Considering the $11 billion that is lost annually due to employee turnover, many companies are likely in need of temporary workers to help keep their staffing needs up to date.
Staffing and temp employment services are both able to help answer the question of how to find a temp position. This can be from either the employee or employer side alike. These can include temporary roles that are needed for full-time or part-time work when it is only needed for a short period of time.
At times temporary workers are needed when an employee is out on long-term leave or at times when there are short-term increases in work or projects. A benefit of a temporary staffing service is the ability of these agencies to search through a long list of available temporary staff that may best meet the needs of a company to fill a specific role.
Both staffing and temp services have the ability to find temporary employees to fill open positions at various companies as they are needed to complete one-time projects or to take on the short-term roles that are left open due to permanent employees that are out on long-term leave. There may also be the need for a position to be temporarily filled while it is being initiated into a company

I asked his permission to bring on a temp to help cover the phones and file and was denied. A week later, he said that he was tired of hearing complaints about my office being closed (not that I'm not there, but that I am doing my job elsewhere in the building). I tried reminding him that I had asked for help, and was denied. That same day, he emailed the former HR Director that I am "not happy" and that I am "not a good representative for HR" and that I needed to find work elsewhere. I am assuming the former HR Director reminded him that one person supporting 500 people is preposterous and to give me a break.

During print the temp signal of the hotend is spiking below the setpoint.
Then the FW detects the error and stops heating. This is working very good!
Now my question, If I disconnect the Temp-Sensor the value goes to 2000.
So cable break should not be the problem.
What has to happen, to have such a described temp behaviour?
I hope somebody can help me to find the root cause.
What type of temperature sensor: thermistor, PT100, PT1000, or thermocouple?
If this happen only during the moves it can be broken cable. Processor recognize "broken cable" or open circuit as very low temperature but in software is this low temperature override by 2000 probably due to safety reason. I don't know exactly logic behind but I think break in cable which disconnects during specific moves for microsecond (or just increase resistance) could show as 15°C.
It's most likely caused by a bad connection in the thermistor cable. A short between the thermistor connections and the hot end metalwork might also cause it.
is a cable break always triggered with 2000?
If not, then a short should be the root.
But short shouldn't give you 15°C, or it'll need to be shorted to very specific voltage. Short to GND should give high temperature. Will short to VIN survive?
Like I said, bad thermistor connection or short to the hot end metalwork. Shorts to the metalwork were very common on E3D hot ends before they switched to cartridge thermistors.

When an employee is injured at work, we always tell our clients that they should file a claim with their employer as soon as possible. However, if you work for a temporary agency you might be wondering, how does that work for me? Can I still file a claim if I work for a temporary staffing agency?
When clients ask me this, my response is “Yes!” You absolutely can still file a workman’s comp claim if you work for a temp agency. Under the NC Workers’ Comp Act, you are entitled to benefits.
Generally, claims are still filed in the same way a permanent employee would; however, the key difference is that you are filing a claim against the temporary work agency and the insurance company not the contracted employer.
If you are injured as a temporary employee then you must inform both your temporary work agency and the employer you are doing work for. For instance, let’s say you’re employed by ABC Staffing Agency, and they place you at Bob’s Truck Shop. You begin work there and things are going well, but one day an accident occurs and you break your arm.

A few of us are up here in the management library trying DESPERATELY to figure out #32 in chapter 10. We have read all the postings about it, but still cannot figure out why 3 steps must be used instead of one for the ice when calculating the final temp. It would be great if someone could do the WHOLE problem out in detail and explain! Thanks!
Ok this is what I did (and I think it is correct): 1)Find joules of heat needed to melt the ice = nCdT + heat of fusion = (1)(37.5)(10)+(6010)=6385J 2)Find the temp change for the water because it lost 6385J heat. (6385J)/nC=28.26 So the water went from 373 to 344.74K. 3)Find the temperature of the mixture by averaging the temp of the water and the melted ice: [(1mol)(273K)+(3mol)(344.74K)]/4mol =326.81K 4)Now find the entropy change FOR THE ICE. Use dS=nCln(T2/T1) =(1mol)(37.5)ln(326.81/273) =6.74J which rounds to 7joules I hope this is helpful and correct. If I am wrong please tell me.
When a substance changes states you must take in consideration each part seperately, becuase of different specfic heat value for liquids, solids and gases. Also you must account for enthalpy of vaporization and/or fusion.
heat gain ice = nCpdT(from -10C to 0C)+n*6010J(dHfusion(icemelting)) +nCpdT(Tf-0C): in this part you are figuring the enthalpy for the ice warming up to 0C, melting and increasing to the final temp.

They may have grown in at an awkward angle or are blocked by another tooth or even your jawbone. Over time, your impacted tooth could cause problems such as decay, damage to other teeth or pain.
Wisdom teeth appear between the ages of 17 and 21. However, they may begin causing problems years earlier. There is not always enough room at the back of your jaw for your wisdom teeth, this can lead to inflammation, pain and difficulty opening your jaw.
Potential problems caused by the presence of improperly grown-in wisdom teeth include infections caused by food particles easily trapped in the jaw area behind the wisdom teeth where regular brushing and flossing is difficult and ineffective. Such infections may be frequent, and can cause considerable pain and medical danger.
Another reason to have a wisdom tooth removed is if the tooth has grown in improperly, causing the tongue to brush up against it.
Dr. Sarna will always suggest saving a tooth whenever possible. Other than wisdom teeth, you may have other problematic teeth that have decay or have been traumatized. There are ways to save your original teeth from extraction and we suggest that you speak with Dr. Sarna or one of our Hawthorne Village Dental Care team members before you decide which course of action is best for you.

Wisdom teeth are commonly the last adult teeth to erupt. They are also well-known for not erupting and lying dormant for several years. They can be impacted, meaning they can be positioned at an angle instead of being positioned ‘straight’. The x-rays below shows two lower wisdom teeth being impacted horizontally. In these cases, it is very unlikely they will erupt into function.
However, if the wisdom tooth is able to be brought into function, we can fit braces to straighten the wisdom tooth.
Dr Kyi has treated a number of cases where we have fitted braces to move a displaced or impacted wisdom tooth into a functional tooth. Some patients may have lost other molar teeth and now the wisdom tooth – if it could be straightened – would be a very useful functional tooth.
The case below shows orthodontic treatment with fixed braces straightening an impacted upper wisdom tooth and bringing the wisdom tooth into function.
There has been much research into the area of wisdom teeth and guidelines are produced by the Royal College of Surgeons regarding the need for wisdom teeth removal. At one time, wisdom teeth were routinely removed electively, even though they may not have caused any symptoms.
Wisdom teeth being positioned so far back in the mouth do not provide much in the way of creating space to correct any crowding in the anterior region of the teeth. As we get older, teeth continuously move, which is why we sometimes notice teeth becoming more crowded as we

A baby’s teeth start to come in when the baby is about six months old. By age three, most children have a full set of twenty primary teeth. Baby teeth will later be lost as your child develops and grows. This makes space for adult teeth, which begin to come in around age six. By the age of twenty-one, a person usually has all of their adult teeth.
Below is a general guide to when a tooth first comes in. However, not all children get the same teeth at the same time. Your child’s teeth may erupt earlier or later than shown below.
As teeth begin to erupt, some babies may have sore or tender gums. Rubbing your child’s gums with a clean wet gauze or finger may help. A clean, chilled teething ring – don’t dip it in sugar, syrup, honey, or other foods – may also ease tender gums.
Gels or creams with benzocaine should not be used to soothe sore gums in babies younger than two. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic that has caused serious reactions in a small number of children. Instead stick with other methods of soothing your child’s gums. If the child is still cranky and uncomfortable while teething, consult your pediatrician.

Below, you can learn about what to expect during the early months – when teeth first come in and how to alleviate discomfort – as well as good oral hygiene habits and brushing techniques you can help your child learn right away.
Your child’s first primary, or “baby” teeth will begin to erupt between the ages of six to 12 months, and will continue to erupt until about age three. During this time, your child’s gums may feel tender and sore. To help alleviate this discomfort, we recommend that you soothe the gums by rubbing a clean finger or a cool, wet cloth across them. When your child has finished teething, you can expect a total of 20 primary teeth.
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that children should visit the dentist by their first birthday.

Upon entering an emergency vehicle, such as a police car, ambulance, or fire truck, the player is not able to listen to the in-game radio. Instead, the emergency service's radio communications are heard, where chatter, instructions and information are relayed to and from a unseen police control room and police units on the ground. Messages heard include reports of disturbances, requests for help, replies and humorous verbal exchanges. Police often uses codes (such as the 10-codes, 11-codes, and so on) to provide short, clear and consistent messages. The codes used in GTA games do not appear to match codes use in the real world, although different police forces often use their own 10-codes. Strangely, the PC, Xbox, and mobile versions of GTA Vice City have two 10-codes that aren't numbers (10-SWITCH CAR representing either grand theft auto, a Rhino destroying a vehicle, or an incendiary attack on a vehicle; 10-VICE CITY representing a destroyed aircraft).

Whats going on in La Palma?
The latest press scare stories were caused by a series of small earthquakes deep inside La Palma island. They happened 14 kilometres under the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the far south of the island.
Press reports about a megatsunami are based on a scientific study, published in 1999, that speculated about the possibility that La Palma's western flank is unstable and could collapse. Subsequent studies have shown that there isn't a fault and that a sudden collapse just isn't going to happen.
Geologists believe that the island needs to grow in height by another 1000 metres before it became unstable. That's going to take between 10,000 and 50,000 years.
Research around the world has found that big landslides caused by volcanoes are extremely rare. Even unstable volcanoes tend to fall apart in bits rather than collapse in one go.
Will La Palma's Cumbre Vieja volcano erupt soon?
This volcano last erupted in 1971 (and before that in 1949) and is still geologically active. It will erupt again at some point and seems to go off about once every 70-200 years on average. However, these eruptions are not huge and don't cause tsunamis or big earthquakes.

Retrieved Text: Wisdom tooth problems are unfortunately common among teens and young adults. Often, the mouth simply doesn’t have enough space for these trouble-prone teeth to erupt properly, causing them to become impacted or stuck in the gums.
Among the many potential issues, impacted wisdom teeth place you at risk for a condition known as pericoronitis, which is painful inflammation of the nearby gum tissues.
Pericoronitis is almost always associated with wisdom tooth problems related to impaction. The condition can develop with third molars that erupt only partially or teeth that fail to push through the gums at all.
Most cases of pericoronitis are caused by a gum flap infection. When a wisdom tooth doesn’t fully erupt, it creates a flap of inflamed or swollen gum tissue. Food particles and debris can easily get trapped underneath, which promotes the growth of infection-causing bacteria.
Pericoronitis may also be the result of minor trauma to the gums surrounding impacted wisdom teeth. The irritated gum tissue is susceptible to micro-injuries during chewing, both from the food itself and the opposing teeth.
How Do Oral Surgeons Diagnose Pericoronitis?
More advanced cases of pericoronitis may also be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the neck, jaw muscle spasms, fever, difficulty opening the mouth and swelling on the affected side of the face.
How Do Oral Surgeons Treat Pericoronitis?
A course of antibiotics, along with frequent rinsing with warm salt water, is usually enough to get rid of pericoronitis. Oral surgeons also advise diligent oral hygiene and eating a soft-food diet to prevent further irritation of the gum tissues. However, as long

Reformats are usually unnecessary, until the issues of correcting file permissions and registry keys becomes more trouble then it takes to reformat. Do also remember, you should boot a Live CD to do your back ups, and use up to date virus/malware scanners before backing up any data files: other wise you risk re-infecting a freshly formatted system.

Of course, there’s the obligatory back-to-school night, but there’s also locker setup day, meet the teacher day and, for those of us with children on the spectrum, meet the support staff opportunities.
It’s not that I don’t want to start off with knowing everything there is to know about a new school year, it’s because I have to socialize. It is never just a small manageable level of interactions with others, it is mega, super, colossal level socializing. Not only do I have to talk to numerous teachers, but I also have to make small talk with other parents.

Writers seem to take this to mean that characters can never cry, that a tearful character is not a sypmathetic one, that readers cannot identify with a weeper. But tears are contagious — when watching a movie, I tend to cry if a character does. Still, even if the adage is true and readers don’t cry when a character does , is that so terrible?
As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, Why “Grief: The Great Yearning” is Important, I started writing about grief when I discovered that so many writers get it wrong. Many novels are steeped in death, with bodies piling up like cordwood, yet no one grieves. The surviving spouses think as clearly as they did before the death. They have no magical thinking, holding two disparate thoughts in their minds at once. (For example: I know he will never need his eyeglasses, but I can’t throw them away because how will he see without them?) The characters have no physical symptoms or bouts of tears that are beyond their control. There is no great yearning to see the dead once more (and this yearning is what drives our grief, not the so-called stages). In other words, we are continually conditioned to downplay the very real presence of grief in our lives. If we don’t see people grieve in real life, in movies, in books, where are we to get a blueprint for grief?

If you're out of butter, you can substitute vegetable oil or shortening. If you only have enough for the crepe batter but none for greasing the pan, use bacon fat or duck fat to grease up.

A lot of foreigners have such an exotic view of French cuisine that it’s hard to explain them French don’t always eat better than other cultures. Sure, French value food — but so do Chinese, Japanese, Argentinean etc. Daily meals do revolve around bread and butter and yes, there are cool pastries everywhere but most people don’t eat fancy stuffs all the time.
The only meal I sometimes miss is crêpes. Yes, it sounds a bit like “crap” but trust me, it’s really good.
Crêpes are Brittany’s specialty and crêperies can be found everywhere in Nantes. These very thin pancakes are made from flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a pinch of salt. Normally, crêpes are slightly sweeet and galettes are unsweetened: the first one is served as dessert and the second one is the main meal. They are traditionally served with very cold cider.
Common fillings for galettes include ham, cheese and egg, or even spinach, salmon, cream, artichoke, sausages… combination are endless! Traditional dessert crêpes are eaten with butter and sugar, and Nutella (the famous hazelnut spread) is also a favorite.
When I first took Feng to a crêperie, I figured nothing could go wrong. After all, he is not very picky and we had some weird food when traveling, so what could go wrong with a thin pancake and basic fillings such ham, cheese and egg? Well, the egg.

In many parts of the world people may be eating some sort of pancakes today. Japan is not included here, but I'd personally like to join the celebration by following this food tradition; you may call it just an excuse for me to eat pancakes, and you'd probably be right.
But anyways, a pancake to me means a North American pancake (we call them "hotcake" in Japanese), the thick and fluffy sort served with maple syrup, chocolate, whipped cream, and/or fruits. But today I chose to make English pancakes, which are very much like French crepes, just like I did for Pancake Day five years ago. In fact, the last time I fried up crepes myself was that time - five years ago; wow, time really does fly.
The main reason for this rather long hiatus in my crepe making is, as I mumbled on that pancake post of five years ago, that I'm crap at making pancakes/crepes.

Many people have the perception that crepes are difficult to make. While it's true that before you get the hang of it, it can be a little tricky to turn a crepe or "flip it." Although once you get it figured out, it's really easy and your crepes will be cooked in no time.
If you have the time, it's nice to make the batter in advance to work out any lumps, however it you don't, they'll be just fine.
There are various ways to serve crepes: with fresh fruit and whipped cream; with feta cheese and smoked ham; with cottege cheese and fruit jam. Or, for a more elaborate meal, fill your crepes with a mushroom sauce, top with cheese and bake in the oven. The possibilites are endless!
First crack the eggs, add the flour, the salt and half the amount of milk in a bowl. Whisk well until most lumps are gone. Now add the rest of the milk, and whisk together. Let sit for 20 minutes or so if you have the time, otherwise no worries. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours in the fridge.

It is Spring Break! Brunch is easily my favorite meal of the day. It combines breakfast with many of the foods that I would eat any time of the day, especially if I am just looking for variety and lightness.
I made these potatoes yesterday inspired by a smashed potato recipe. I microwaved them for 3 minutes (depending on the size of the spud). Don’t forget to stab with fork or it will explode. I cut them in fours and loaded them up with butter, fresh chopped garlic, cheddar cheese, red pepper flakes and dried dill.
I baked them on 375 till the cheese and garlic turned brown. You’ll know by the smell. What you get – a crispy crunchy cheesey delight to accompany your eggs.
Next brunchy delight is the corn meal crepes. I have never made crepes before, and this was really easy. I used the corn meal to add that nice flavor of corn bread which – coming from a girl with a southern mother – goes with anything. Why crepes? Because you can’t wrap ingredients in pancakes unless you want to eat a ton of carb.
Mix these ingredients together and let them sit for 30 min. The batter will seem very thin at first and thicken over time. Add a bit of milk as you work with the batter to keep those crepes thin.
Baby has a complexion like butter…and strangely resembles a kewpie doll.
Every crepe should be premised by an even brushing of butter on the pan. Pour 1/3 cup

The possibilities of what to do with them are endless. They can be for any meal or even a snack. Such a simple thing to make but such an classy thing to serve. I have never heard or seen anyone who isn’t impressed when given a crepe. Always ooohhhs and aaaahhhhs and mmmmmms can be heard. So why not impress your friends and make something, anything with crepes.
CREPES In a bowl add 1 1/2 cups of flour, along with 2 cups of milk and 3 eggs. Mix well and don’t worry about the little lumps. Heat a non stick pan with a glug of olive oil. When the oil is hot pour in 3/4 of a soup ladle of batter into a preheated pan. You can put a little less but I like mine thicker so that is what I do. Pick up the pan on an angle and twirl it in a circle to spread the batter around to cover the bottom of the pan. Brown on one side… Then flip to brown the other side. Repeat these steps until all the batter is used up. Let them cool, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. I like to make these 1 day ahead then they are ready to go when I need them.

Crepes are much easier to make than you might actually think. If you haven’t tried making them yet, please do so. I really believe that once you add them to your repertoire (of course, I had to add that French word! haha) that you’ll just continue to make them.
AND the more you make them, the better you’ll get!
Use a combination of mascarpone cheese and cottage cheese in the lemon crepe filling. I’ve used just cottage cheese in my Cheese Blintzes with Strawberry Sauce and that’s delicious, but the addition of the mascarpone gives it a rich creaminess.
I know that many crepe fillings use ricotta, but using low-fat cottage cheese is a great way to cut down on calories.
If you’re pressed for time, lemon curd can be purchased at your local grocer, but as always, anything homemade is well worth every single bite.

Gradually add the remaining milk, whisking between additions, until you have added all the milk and the batter is smooth (it will be a rather thin batter).

However, as I did pick Croatia vs. Japan as my World Cup dinner game, I paid especially close attention. The game was a draw; not just a draw, but a scoreless draw. Not only that, but both teams missed out when they had easy chances to score—Croatia on a penalty kick, and Japan on an opportunity that only required them to tap the ball into the net. So, I was left with a dilemma. There are no tie breakers in the World Cup, and I was not in the mood to devise an Eastern European twist on the dragon roll.

Saturday morning we headed to St. Lawrence Market to check out the farmer’s market and do a little general shopping. While there we decided to have breakfast, since neither of us had eaten yet. I suggested we try both Everyday Gourmet (for coffee) and Crepe it Up (for a crepe or two).
Everyday Gourmet had caught my eye the number of times I’d been to St. Lawrence Market. Inside you’ll find coffee beans from all over the world, many of which are organic and/or fair trade. They also roast many of their beans in-house, and the giant roaster off to the right side of the store always seems to be in use. We opted to get some of their Haitian Blue beans as well as some of their Guatemalan Decaf, both of which are fair trade. We also decided to each get a double espresso to go; a little something to sip while we waited for crepes. The espresso was quite nice, with a good crema and not too much bitterness. Not the best espresso I’ve ever had, but still lovely, and I’d be happy to go back and order another sometime.

You can have them as a part of a delicious breakfast, a nutritious lunch, a delectable dinner, or even as a midday snack. Here are some useful pointers to help you make mouth-watering crepes.
It may seem like a great idea to quickly whip up the batter, pour it on to the pan to get thin crepes, and eat them immediately. However, it is advisable to prepare it in advance and allow it to rest at least for an hour. This will add to the flavour and give your crepes better texture and taste. If you feel like having crepes for breakfast, you can even prepare the batter the night before.
To get the perfect paper-thin crepes that taste great, you must ensure that there are no lumps in the batter while making it. Use a strainer and a blender to mix the ingredients properly to get a smooth batter.
One of the secrets to getting soft, perfect crepes is to get the consistency of the batter right. Make sure that your batter is ‘runny,’ unlike pancake batter which is supposed to be thick.
You must pour an adequate quantity of batter on to the pan. If you use too little or too much of it, you will not get the desired quality. Ideally, one-fourth cup of batter makes one crepe. If you want to have a slightly larger one, pour one-third cup on the pan instead.
It is essential to heat the pan adequately

Millie Creperie has a wonderful assortment of gelatos (they have some Italian going on here too) from hazelnut to matcha green tea that they use for their dessert crepes.

Fantastic flavour and very light, this dessert is not cumbersome and it’s great for a hot summer day (not that we’ve had many in Toronto).

A couple months ago, I received some camembert cheese from Ile de France (and you can see what I did with it here). It was delicious, so when I got asked to try another Ile de France cheese, I was on board. This time I went with goat cheese. I’d put goat cheese as one of my top 2 cheeses (the other being smoked gouda). It has a great taste, a nice tang, and a wonderful texture.
This cheese is great on its own and it’s great in meals. Case in point: these savory crepes. I wanted to make something that had minimal ingredients to really showcase the cheese. I love goat cheese with mushrooms, so I went that route. I thought of making phyllo triangles or a tart but I ultimately ended on crepes because though I love crepes, I’ve never made them. I admit I was a little worried about tackling crepes. I am really terrible at flipping (anything) and my stove is very unlevel. But, these were so easy to make! I only had one crepe casualty and that’s just because I was getting too cocky with how easily they were turning out for me, and decided to multitask.
Since I only used about half the goat cheese in this recipe, I was also able to use it in this farro bake, and one of our staple meals – chicken with goat cheese & sundried tomato sauce. All were delicious. Thanks, Ile

Behind every outrageous scheme or impassioned outburst is usually a motivation grounded in real, relatable emotions. The comedy on this show often comes from those over-the-top reactions, but the heart comes from the love and friendship that drives those reactions.

Due in part to her tireless research, the court ultimately found that the Canadian Red Cross and government officials, in a move to save money, did not use proven surrogate screening of the blood supply until 1990, nine years after the US instituted their testing.

Don’t act like the same can’t happen to you Kenya.

Some can say Kenya is experiencing karma as well. Since she got on the show, all she did was give her opinionssssss and put her nose in other people’s marriages. Now that it’s being done to her she can’t take it and feel like everyone should mind there business. Funny!

With film-makers experimenting with content and wooing audiences with slice-of-life stories made well, how could anyone come up with something as daft as this one?
In a 'pind' in Punjab, Param (Arjun Kapoor) stalks Jasmeet (Parineeti Chopra) over several festivals — in that state, people seem to do nothing but dance — till she comes up to talk to him. His excuse for this creepy behaviour is, “Ashiq ghoorte nahin, niharte hain.” Whatever!
To facilitate their meeting and allow her to work as a jewellery designer without her conservative grandfather finding out, all her friends call the old man with excuses to invite her over. Eventually, a proposal is made the formal way, and the stern grandpa says yes, provided Jasmeet does not work after marriage.
For some reason, Jasmeet does not think of moving to a big city in India, but gets obsessed with going to London; women in India ostensibly cannot have careers! A friend-turned-foe has such connections that he blocks Param’s visa to every country in the world — even Bangladesh! So Jasmeet has a sham marriage with Sam (Aditya Seal) so that she can go to London on a “marriage visa,” get her residency, then divorce him, go back and fetch Param over!

"Perbacco," loosely translated, is an Italian word reflecting pleasure and surprise - something like "Wow!" You can see it in the eyes of Umberto Gibin, the owner of Perbacco Ristorante, when his wife of 24 years strides through the doors of his much-lauded restaurant. Smiling, the two slip cozily into a booth.
It's just days since the New York Times dusted the place with accolades, calling it a top Italian restaurant and the pastas "just short of incredible." But the humble Umberto, now 55, doesn't mention the recent glitter; instead, he recounts the story of his romance with a nice Jewish girl from Los Angeles.
It was during the mid-'80s, when Umberto, a recent immigrant from Italy, was introduced to Leslie Levine, now 53, as she dined with friends at Chianti, where he worked. Leslie's father ran a well-known steak house with a formidable wine list. Soon, Umberto, dressed in what Leslie remembers as a stunning Armani suit, was seated in her family's restaurant, where she worked.
Despite interest on both sides, it took months for Umberto to make a move. "I thought I wasn't good enough for her," he jokes. "I was just an Italian desperado." One day, on the way to catering Sally Fields' then-husband's 40th birthday party, he called. "Now or never," he thought.
Their first date, a conversation-packed four-hour dinner, led to more. And soon he met Shayna, Leslie's 2-year-old daughter from her

Together, they face and surmount minor hurdles, but nothing terribly dramatic ever transpires. It's just a small pleasure to share their company for 90 minutes—nothing more, nothing less. Making Grace documents the conception and early life of the couple's first child, and while a second child is subsequently conceived, the film's quiet affability doesn't exactly demand a sequel. Krsul and Sullivan eventually emerge as something resembling loving, responsible poster children for lesbian parenting, but thankfully not at the expense of their quirkiness, neuroses, or humanity.
Card-carrying members of Focus on the Family, take note: Lesbian mothers are nice ladies with normal lives.
"Making Grace" is a small, intimate documentary that patiently observes the highs and lows of a 30-something couple who want to become parents. That the couple are lesbians is perhaps the most remarkable feature of an unremarkable film; yet, in its very mundanity, the story of Ann Krsul and Leslie Sullivan is quiet proof that families are indeed created, not mandated.
I had the laid-back pleasure of watching this film this weekend. I thought it was such an intriguing snapshot of the year 2000: paper files at the doctor's office, the twin towers in the Manhattan skyline, and predates the current wave of gay marriage legalization winning over the USA right now.

Yolonda’s desire to start this ministry was a part of her vow to God to help teenage girls to learn to respect their bodies and find value in living a holy life after she made a life-changing decision to have an abortion. While Yolonda had the choreography and dance experience she wasn’t sure of the spiritual aspect so she approached Marlyn Josey, who was the youth choir director at the time, to help explain what liturgical dance was and serve as the ministry’s spiritual advisor.
The ministry started with four members: Leslie Alexander, Danielle Ferguson, Brittany Glover, and Brandi Taylor. Later two more joined: Kirstin Banks and Ashley Smith. The ministry debuted in the fall of 2000 at Shiloh’s Homecoming Praise Rally. In the spring of 2001, they held their first Dancefest at the Lee Center in Alexandria, VA. In 2002, Yolonda and Marlyn took a leave of absence. Marlyn entered seminary and Yolonda answered the call of preparing for marriage. During this time the ministry was under the leadership of Kimberly Gordon. With the departure of the original members due to personal, spiritual, and educational reasons, the ministry ended by the winter of 2002.
In 2005, one of the original members, Leslie Alexander, had a life experience that would ultimately change her life forever. She went in to prayer to ask God for healing over her wounded mind, body, and spirit.

Leslie was my first friend. And even though she would own her first-born, bossy stereotype personality, we very much loved each other and got along quite well when we were little.

Weddings are supposed to be one of the happiest days of a couple&apos;s life, but that wasn&apos;t exactly the case for an Egyptian groom and his newlywed bride.
Just moments after their wedding party wrapped up, the couple got into a car to head home. The bride&apos;s parents then approached the vehicle and asked to have a moment with their daughter before she left for her honeymoon, Al Watan newspaper reported.
That&apos;s when the groom completely flipped out, started screaming at them, and told them they didn&apos;t need to bid their daughter farewell because they had already spent all night with her.
The bride&apos;s uncle tried to intervene and help calm the man down, but that didn&apos;t work.
According to one of the wedding guests, the groom got out of the car, threw a fit, and swore he was going to divorce his wife.
"I swear on divorce, I am never getting in a car with her again and I am not entering our apartment tonight," he said.
Just moments later, a huge fight ensued outside the wedding hall, with members of both the couple&apos;s families throwing chairs and metal objects at each other. Five people were injured in the wedding brawl.
A source told Al Watan that the bride then headed to her marital home but her husband refused to go with her.

The premise of last night’s episode, “Fancy Party,” was that April and Andy decided to get married.

Like many of my mainly working-class ancestors, Janet Trail left a very light trace on recorded history and I know her only through statutory BDM and census records.
From available records, I believe she was born between 1832 and 1835 (1), and most likely in Auchtermuchty, Fife, Scotland (2). Although parish registers exist for Auchtermuchty for that time period, I have been unable to find any record of Janet’s birth (3).
Both Janet’s marriage and death records list her parents as William Trail and Christian Birrell.
I cannot find a marriage record for William and Christian, although it appears that William married a woman named Catharine Imrie in 1814. The OPR marriage record shows that William, a weaver, married Catharine “daughter to the deceased David Imrie late Wright in Auchtermuchty” in Perth, in November 1814.
Old parish records tend to be very sparse in the information they provide, but the entry above is a useful exception. Knowing that Catharine Imrie’s father was from Auchtermuchty provides a viable explanation as to how Perth-born William came to live and raise a family there.
William and Catharine’s marriage produced two children, Mary Trail b. 1815 in Perth, and John Trail b. 1817 in Auchtermuchty.

Consideration may also need to be given to “The Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009, (example gas cylinders), although these now implement the ADR regulations.
Shippers, whether despatching or receiving have a duty to ensure that consignments comply with the regulations. Coupled with this, in ADR, there is a requirement to ensure that vehicles, including equipment carried, documentation on board, and driver licences comply.
This all sounds quite daunting so shippers should also be aware of exemptions for small consignments and loads. We will talk about these later in this article.
Consideration should be given to IMDG when consignments are crossing water and there is a road journey, before and after this. Here the sea journey is classed as the most hazardous part and the IMDG then takes precedence over ADR for the goods being shipped. The vehicle is still subject to ADR.
The Channel Tunnel’s policy on transporting dangerous goods is based on ADR but it is stricter.

If this sounds unfamiliar, good for you. You don’t need this.
For the rest of us, it may be helpful to know that some people seem to have outsize difficulty with reading neutral faces as neutral, even if they are exceptionally accurate at interpreting other facial expressions. Over the past decade psychologists have been piecing together why this occurs.
A study published in March in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships suggests that some people who grew up with parents who fought a lot never learned to properly read those in-between faces, perhaps because they spent so much time watching out for signs of conflict.
These findings build on previous research indicating that depression, anxiety and irritability can affect how a person perceives other people’s faces. It has also been shown that adults who were exposed to violence, neglect or physical abuse in childhood are more likely to see hostility where there is none. This can create a self-reinforcing cycle.
“If you think they look angry then you may respond angrily,” said Abigail Marsh, the director of the Laboratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience at Georgetown University.

While they might passively remember these messages from constant exposure, they won’t actively remember most of them. So how can you make sure your messages don’t blend into the white noise made by all the others? Here are a few helpful tips for improving your messaging to make it more useful, to be unobtrusive, and most importantly, memorable.
1. Make sure your message is going to the right person.
Have you ever gotten excited about getting a package in the mail, only to discover it’s for someone else in your family? Sure, you got to open it vicariously, but you’re still disappointed for not getting something special. This is similar to how it would feel if your web-app announcement or guided tour wasn’t relevant to your customer. Engagement software can hold many different customer properties and an incredible number of ways you can target your users. This is useful because you might want to create a unique message for a particular customer segment. For example, only customers who have the email domain of “@acme.com,” have logged into your site 7 times, and use the Safari browser. Developing highly-targeted segments like this one help make sure the right message is delivered to the right person.
2. Make sure your message is showing up at the right place.
Now, this time, imagine instead of another family member getting the package, this package was for your neighbor. So, like the law abiding citizen

Have you seen a woman who is perfectly good looking but lack of personal hygiene? Some people may find it shameful and some people find it ridiculous. But honestly, it is more regretful. If ever that woman smells nice as much as she looks nice, She will be a total package of beauty!
That’s why a classy lady and gentleman need a signature perfume. You may not afford Chanel, Versace or Jo Malone brands because of how pricey it is. But you can still smell classy and expensive on a budget with some drug store perfumes.
These are the reasons why a signature perfume is important because aside from it will label you as a person, it also shows off your individuality.

Having seen it advertised numerous times on TV programs such as TMZ and E! Entertainment, it became obvious to me that this weight loss product was one of the most popular options in the industry. I had to find out why.
Every day, weight loss hopefuls are inundated with products that make extreme promises. However, it’s inarguable that not all of those products live up to our expectations. Often, desperate people search for and use things that end up leaving them disappointed and out of money. So, after careful research and a little testing of my own, I discovered how and why 310 Nutrition was different.

I am one of those people, with no time to wait around on the pounds to melt off. I, like many of you, require something that is not only effective but that is also backed by trusted scientific research. No more playing Russian roulette with my health.

However, like it or not, consumers can be entirely judgemental and might reach a decision about a purchase or how to engage with a product within just a few short seconds, based on little more than a cursory glance.
Therefore, when it comes to designing labels, you need to take into account that whoever is reading them may not take their time to consume all of your handiwork before coming to conclusions of their own.
The importance of this was highlighted by a case that saw a label being misread lead to a great number of contact lens customers pouring hydrogen peroxide solution into their eyes, mistaking it for a saline one.
According to a story by the Inquirer reported on Philly.com, while the packaging of Clear Care cleaning solution displayed bright red warning labels explaining not to use the product directly on the eyes and only to use it in conjunction with an associated special case to neutralise the hydrogen peroxide, it would appear the connotations of the packaging were too similar to that of saline solution products.
The report went on to point out there was a history of complaints made about Clear Care, suggesting that such a misunderstanding was not unique to just one or two careless customers.

Shippers, whether despatching or receiving have a duty to ensure that consignments comply with the regulations. Coupled with this, in ADR, there is a requirement to ensure that vehicles, including equipment carried, documentation on board, and driver licences comply.
This all sounds quite daunting so shippers should also be aware of exemptions for small consignments and loads. We will talk about these later in this article.
Consideration should be given to IMDG when consignments are crossing water and there is a road journey, before and after this. Here the sea journey is classed as the most hazardous part and the IMDG then takes precedence over ADR for the goods being shipped. The vehicle is still subject to ADR.
The Channel Tunnel’s policy on transporting dangerous goods is based on ADR but it is stricter.

If this sounds unfamiliar, good for you. You don’t need this.
For the rest of us, it may be helpful to know that some people seem to have outsize difficulty with reading neutral faces as neutral, even if they are exceptionally accurate at interpreting other facial expressions. Over the past decade psychologists have been piecing together why this occurs.
A study published in March in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships suggests that some people who grew up with parents who fought a lot never learned to properly read those in-between faces, perhaps because they spent so much time watching out for signs of conflict.
These findings build on previous research indicating that depression, anxiety and irritability can affect how a person perceives other people’s faces. It has also been shown that adults who were exposed to violence, neglect or physical abuse in childhood are more likely to see hostility where there is none. This can create a self-reinforcing cycle.
“If you think they look angry then you may respond angrily,” said Abigail Marsh, the director of the Laboratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience at Georgetown University.

Check to see how your school’s process for this works, then read along as we explain how to survive this awkward situation.
It’s pretty nervewracking chatting with your current roommate about wanting to move out, but it’s so necessary. First and foremost, most schools require that every student involved in the swap signs off on the agreement. That means you can’t just dip while your current roommate is in class. (And then hope to never see them again.) Regardless of your reason, keeping open communication will help relieve a lot of the tension involved in this situation.
The first step, of course, is communicating why you want to swap. Otherwise, fingers get pointed, two sides of the story will start floating around, and it’s just one big mess. Keep this conversation civil, and don’t be afraid to enlist the help of your RA if you feel you need a mediator. From there, make sure to keep open communication as the process continues — from discussing the date you’ll be moving, what time of day you’re going to do all the heavy hauling, and so on.

Not only do you have to live in a room the size of a closet freshman year—you have to share that small space! First impressions are important, and your initial conversations with your new roommate can set the tone for your relationship for the months to come.

Unless it was discussed ahead of time, you shouldn’t assume you’re close enough with your roommate to take their things without asking. They probably wouldn’t have the best reaction if they saw you sporting their favorite shirt without permission!

Retrieved Text: Signing a rental agreement or a lease is an important part of renting a home. It establishes that both you and your landlord are liable for a set of rules, such as when and how a landlord may enter the rental unit and how much notice each party must give to terminate the agreement. Your lease or rental agreement also establishes, in writing, the amount of rent you owe and the day it’s due each month, and lists the names of tenants authorized to live in the rental unit.
Most landlords allow roommates to share a home as long as all parties sign the lease or rental agreement, and are officially tenants, with a direct relationship with the landlord. However, there are instances when a significant other or a friend moves in your rental unit without the landlord’s knowledge. In other situations, the landlord may have even allowed a boyfriend or girlfriend to move in without signing the lease (or has turned a blind eye to the arrangement).
Assuming your lease or rental agreement (like most) limits occupants of the rental unit to people who are tenants (and have signed the lease or rental agreement), your landlord may terminate your tenancy for violating your legal agreement by bringing in unauthorized subtenants. (A subtenant is someone who subleases or rents all or part of the rental premises from a tenant, not from the landlord.)

Normally, when showing photos of my bullet journal and explaining how I use it, I only post my monthly spreads – like this one for August. These posts include all the trackers and other pages I use throughout the month. However, a lot of people seem to like these posts and want more, so strap yourselves in kids, today you’re getting what you wished for – more journal photos! (Probably not you in particular, but some other strange internet-dweller like me who gets their thrills through arty organisation).
It’s time for everyone’s favourite post of the month: my bullet journal spreads for the next few weeks. After taking a little bit of time away from the intensity of this form of creative organisation, I eased myself back into it all last month with a sort-of-half setup. I also got a tad more creative with the design of my pages, opting for a watercolour lavender theme, and my interest in using watercolours only grew when I started planning my August setup.
For the first time since I started bullet journalling, April was a month in which my bullet journal actually hit the right tone across all of my spreads. It was colourful, yet uncomplicated, condensed yet not overwhelming, simple yet exciting. It has taken me four months to really understand what I want from this organisational tool and now that I’ve found a method that works (for now)

This has been the biggest “monetary” aspect of my blog, and it actually mainly comes through my Instagram. As an influencer, companies will contact you asking for an Instagram post(s)/stories/blog post in exchange for a product sample. In the past year, I’ve received about $4000 in merchandise through collaborations.
I’ve opted to not include ads up until now because my traffic isn’t anywhere near the volume at which that would be successful. At this point, ads would probably deter anyone from coming to my site!
Some might consider that a failure, but what has mattered more to me is that I’ve gotten great comments and emails about how helpful my blog has been for people. That’s a success in my book because it’s the reason why I blog!
Up until this past month, I’ve seen regular traffic that was very low. About 1,500 page views a month.

Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) stock dipped 18.7% in October, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Shares lost ground amid last month's broader market sell-off.
The website-creation company saw steeper declines than the broader market, but that's expected from a growth-dependent tech stock during a market pullback. There doesn't appear to have been company-specific news behind its performance last month.

“Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks,” Jesus said.
And in that one exclamation, I’d figured out something very unpleasant about my heart.
It hurts to tell this story. I wrestled with deciding if it really needed brought up or not. But it was a milestone for me in a journey of something God has been teaching me for a while: Why do I do hard things?
Wow, that’s super cool you’re writing for the Rebelution now! But it’s much cooler how open you’re willing to be about pride. I know I’ve definitely struggled with it (and still do!) Thanks for sharing.

In recent weeks a number of new shows have been announced that should keep local music fans rocking well into 2014.
First up, alt-rock legends The Pixies, who recently jettisoned a founding member (bass player Kim Deal) and released their first batch of new songs in ages (the middling EP-1), visit LC Pavilion for a concert on Friday, Feb. 7. Tickets are $39 in advance/$42 at the door and go on sale Friday, Oct. 11, at ticketmaster.com.
If synchronized dance moves are more your thing, British/Irish boy band The Wanted is scheduled to visit LC Pavilion on Wednesday, May 14.

For the fifth Panic! album though, I have to say that it doesn’t really matter at this point. Urie has hit a new stride as a song writer and the fifth Panic! at the Disco album is essentially the best Panic! at the Disco album.
The new album, titled “Death of a Bachelor” sees Urie honing in his own stylish version of pop rock and taking it to a completely different level than what we’ve heard from him in the past. It’s a new sound that’s slightly influenced by an older era of music – think Rat Pack/Crooner era – with modern music that’s heavily influenced by 80’s pop. It’s a style that’s all its own and evolution for Panic! at the Disco that’s a blast to listen to. The sound and the style of the music is tremendous, but you can’t discredit Urie’s songwriting here. He wrote an album that’s filled with terrific melodies and he brings them to life perfectly with his distinct vocal.
Ten years ago if you would have told me that Panic! at the Disco would release an album that would become one of my favorites I would have laughed in your face. That’s not so true now. “Death of a Bachelor” isn’t just a good album, it’s an essential listen for 2016.

The song—considered by many to be one of the best rock songs of all time—was written by Queen frontman Freddie Mercury in 1975. A Freddie Mercury biopic named after the celebrated song is set to be released Nov. 2.
The film stars Rami Malek as Mercury, alongside Joe Mazzello and Gwilym Lee as as Queen members John Deacon and Brian May. The stars will introduce Panic! At The Disco’s performance from the AMAs at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
This will be Panic! At The Disco’s first performance at the AMAs. In addition, Panic! are also nominated for favorite artist in alternative rock.
Panic! At The Disco originally released a cover of the iconic rock song for the Suicide Squad soundtrack.
You can watch Panic! At The Disco’s AMAs performance live Oct. 9.
This is a big year for Panic! and award shows. Earlier this year, they performed “High Hopes” at the MTV Video Music Awards where they got the internet buzzing as they handed out something special to those in the audience including Post Malone.

Retrieved Text: Panic! at the Disco was formed in the suburban area of Summerlin, a suburb of Las Vegas, by childhood friends Ryan Ross on guitar and Spencer Smith on drums.
Since the age of thirteen, the two played blink-182 covers in bands of different formations, but finally recruited Brent Wilson on bass and Brendon Urie on vocals and guitar. One theory of the origin of the band's name is from the song Panic by The Smiths, which includes the line "burn down the disco". The main theory is that the band's name originated from a song written by Name Taken, titled "Panic".
In order to get their music heard, the band contacted Fall Out Boy bassist Peter Wentz, through LiveJournal, and sent him a link to their PureVolume site. Wentz was so impressed that he took a trip to Las Vegas to meet the band in person. After seeing them play in their garage, he asked if they would sign with his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance.
The band officially announced the departure of their bassist, Brent Wilson, with a message on the band's website on May 17, 2006. No official reason was given for Wilson's departure, although later Wilson claimed he had been kicked out the band. The announcement stated that a long-time friend of the band, Jon Walker, would be filling in for the summer tour as a temporary bassist while the band searched for a permanent replacement. On July 3 of that year, the band's Myspace profile was edited to list Walker as bassist/vocals, and Walker

Started in the suburbs of Las Vegas by four high school friends, Panic! At the Disco began by covering Blink-182 songs. Desperate to get out of the stagnant Las Vegas music scene, the band attracted the attention of Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. He signed Panic! At the Disco on to his label in 2004, kick starting the group's rise to fame. Their single "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" exploded in popularity, winning MTV's Video of the Year Award. Their sophomore album was a stylistic deviation from their first, focusing on more of a retro sound inspired by bands like the Beach Boys and the Beatles. This new sound led to a split in the band, as members Ryan Ross and Jon Walker left to pursue it in a new group, while Panic! At the Disco continued with its signature electropunk pop rock sound.

I remember booking tickets for the Royal Albert Hall charity concert, thinking to myself “I dearly hope that they perform the Introspective version of Left to my own devices”. I also remember thinking, after hearing it, in its full glory, that if I left there and then, I’d be a happy guy (they opened with it).
Anyway, this got me thinking...what song would you choose to hear performed live if you could only have one song played, at a venue close to you for a nominal fee?!!!
and it did happen there.
I’m probably going to get slated for this, but here goes!
I’d go for Go West, but not any old version. I’d choose the version that they played at Live 8, in Moscow but minus Sylvia!
I love that version. Chris playing piano during the “low key” first bit...the melodic guitar solo/riff...then it goes full on 4 on the floor disco before going all trance-like at the end for a few minutes or more with Neil playing keyboards next to Chris à la “Young offender - Nightlife Tour”. Would be a quality seven or eight minutes, that!!!
Have they ever performed DJ Culture live, even as a one-off?
Any recordings of this Heaven gig in circulation/ online and are they of a listenable quality? I appreciate you won't be able to share links here but I'll keep a look out for it when I go on YouTube et al.
But the quality is not good.

I first saw Karen’s wonderful garden art when she dropped by the Empress of Dirt Facebook page and shared her latest work of art. And boy did she knock my socks off.
Not only are her garden balls beautiful, but I immediately noticed how meticulous she is with her work. I could see that she takes tremendous care (and time) to achieve this level of perfection.
When readers see Karen’s work, they always ask the same questions so she’s kindly answered them (below) and best of all, you can buy these garden balls if you prefer.
Creations: garden art balls, barrettes with recycled jewelry pieces, dish gardens, drawing pixies, elves, and aliens, painting, mosaics.
1 What supplies do you use for your garden art balls?
Bowling balls – large and small (candle pin) bowling balls.
You can also use old, glass lamp globes. They have nice, thick glass and do not break.
Marbles – flat-bottom marbles, round marbles (glass gems), square gems.
Mini-bits (embellishment glass, 2-4 mm). You may also find them sold as vase fillers – see them here on Amazon. Be sure they are glass or plastic, not the ones that dissolve or inflate in water.

She asked me what I thought of the recipe, and I took one look and told her that she shouldn’t waste her time; the resulting fudge balls would be terrible. I just couldn’t imagine black beans doubling as fudge. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give the recipe a try, and I have to say that I hereby stand corrected. The fudge balls were delicious. Who knew that ground up beans could pass as fudge.
When I made them, I brought them out on a plate and asked the boys if they wanted to try one. The first question I got was – are they made with cheese? broccoli? The boys don’t trust me any more. When I assured them that they weren’t made with cheese OR broccoli, they deigned to try them although they still didn’t trust me. Three out of four boys loved them. One said it tasted like coconut and he spit it out. That’s the one that pretty much only eats peanut butter sandwiches.
The original recipe calls for a thin chocolate glaze. I had some Ghirardelli melting wafers on hand, so I used those as a glaze. I like a good, crunchy chocolate shell.
The recipe makes about a dozen fudge balls. If you need more, double or triple the recipe. If you’re making a single batch, I highly recommend using a mini food

A freak innings like Nathan Astle’s is one thing, but Sehwag does this kind of thing consistently. At the close of play Virender Sehwag was 309 not out and he’d scored those runs off just 292 balls, hitting 41 fours and five sixes.
Sehwag’s hit 309 before, against Pakistan. It took him 375 balls. That shouldn’t be bettered, but it just was. Sehwag can also boast the second and seventh fastest Test double hundreds of all time (assuming this one still counts as the third fastest now that he’s gone past 300).
As we said earlier, no batsman other than Virender Sehwag can sustain this speed of scoring for such long periods. He has a unique ability to strike good balls for boundaries without offering chances. Can anyone else play such outrageous shots without seeming in any danger?
He’s only the third batsman to score two triple hundreds after Don Bradman and Brian Lara. Has he got any adrenaline left for tomorrow? Lara’s 400 will surely come under threat if he has. Ordinarily 91 runs is a long way, but Sehwag has so comprehensively shredded this South African team they’re liable to go foetal when they see him return to the crease. He’s made Rahul Dravid look like a tail-ender.
Virender Sehwag must surely be regarded as one of the greats now. Yes?

Thankfully, that police officer has the privilege of carrying concealed and he had his trusty wheel gun holstered inside the waistband. He was able to draw and shoot the robber, resulting in the robber’s death.
According to the Times Ledger, the off-duty officer was not in uniform and likely just walking down the block to get a cup of coffee when he was confronted outside the store. The robber was armed with an illegally-obtained handgun. While the police officer was able to shoot the robber, he had to be taken to the hospital after he began to experience heart palpitations.

Almost the exact same language from the Public Health Code prohibiting the dumping of "brine, swill..." is found in the New York City Administrative Code. Occasionally, the police will charge this Administrative Code version instead of the Public Health version when giving someone a ticket for urinating in public.
No swill, brine, offensive animal matter, noxious liquid, or other filthy matter of any kind, shall be allowed by any person to fall upon or run into any street, or public place, or be taken to or put therein.
Sound familiar? (See Public Health Code).
Although the language is virtually the same, there is actually an important difference between the Administrative Code version and the Public Health Code version. That difference is the seriousness of the offense. The Administrative Code version is considered a violation level offense, and is NOT A CRIME. Therefore, if you are charged with the Administrative Code version, and you are found guilty, you will not have a criminal record.
It is a quirk in our laws that the exact same behavior, charged under exactly the same language can result in you getting a criminal or not based simply on the whim of the police officer who writes up the summons. I'm not entirely sure this situation would survive a serious Constitutional challenge, but it seems nobody has been sufficiently aggrieved to bother to take the time and use the resources necessary to mount such a challenge.

Such policing policies have been used in several cities in years past and have been a controversial subject for law enforcement and society in general. So what exactly is stop and frisk and how might the Trump administration influence how police officers interact with citizens?
During the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the NYPD began an aggressive anti-crime initiative in which patrol officers would approach civilians in high crime areas of the city, engage them in pointed questions regarding their presence in the area and perform a pat search of their person. The idea behind the procedure was that officers would seek out individuals they believe to likely be in possession of weapons or drugs, increase the number of arrests for contraband possession and minor offenses, proactively preventing them from committing more serious offenses. The goal of stop and frisk was to reduce the overall crime rate, particularly for more serious violent crimes. The policy was immediately controversial and widely believed to be disproportionately enforced toward minorities. Eventually civil rights groups initiated a federal lawsuit against the NYPD in the case of Floyd v. City of New York. In Floyd, a federal district court judge ruled that while the practice itself was not unconstitutional, the manner in which the NYPD conducted stop and frisks from 2005-2013, without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and often on the basis of a person’s race, was unconstitutional and racially discriminatory.

Narcan is a drug that medical professionals and more recently police officers, can administer in suspected overdose cases to reverse the overdose and potentially save a person’s life.
What happens if an officer administers the medication to someone who has not overdosed?
When somebody negligently, recklessly, or intentionally acts or fails to act in such a way as to cause injury to another person, a personal injury lawsuit may be appropriate.

Most New York gun investigations are conducted by law enforcement by using a search warrant. When the police department or prosecutor’s office gets word that an individual has a gun in their car, home, locker, storage unit, et cetera, they work to obtain a search warrant immediately. The police will take up the information to the prosecutor who will write up a search warrant. They then take the search warrant to the judge who authorizes them to go find the gun.
Law enforcement officers do their best to avoid letting someone know if they are being investigated for anything, especially for a weapons charge. Most often, an individual does not find out they are under investigation until either they, or people they know, are called in for questioning by detectives or placed under arrest. At this point, enough investigation has been done to make the police department confident that they can charge someone.

An experienced assault on an officer lawyer knows these elements and how to disprove them. They can help create a strong defense strategy to help protect your rights.
In any assault case, New York prosecutors need to prove the specific elements of the charge. If the defendant is charged with causing a serious physical injury, the prosecutor must show that the defendant intentionally caused that injury, regardless of whether that person is a police officer.
If the defendant is charged with causing physical injury to a police officer who is doing their lawful duty, the prosecutor needs to show that the defendant was aware that the alleged victim was a police officer, that the police officer was performing a lawful duty, and that the defendant caused the injury. In this situation the prosecutor is not required to show that the defendant had any specific intention to cause an injury, but simply intended to impede the officer from executing their duty.

Video — released more than a year after the fatal incident — shows the 17-year-old black youth jogging and then walking down the street on the city’s Southwest Side, holding a small knife by his side. Prosecutors say he was 10 feet from officer Jason Van Dyke, who fired 16 rounds.
But as The Wall Street Journal reports, the initial police report contains many details that appear to describe a different reality of that same event.
Mr. Van Dyke said he believed the youth “was attacking w/ knife, trying to kill” him, according to the report, and so he began to fire. In a subsequent interview, the officer described the possibility the weapon could have been a throwing knife and brought up a department bulletin warning of knives equipped to fire bullets.
Van Dyke’s colleagues claimed McDonald waved his knife, according to the report, and attempted to get back up after being shot. But none of this is on the video, which shows the teenager lying in the street after being shot. McDonald is a full traffic lane from officers when he is shot.
The police report’s version is not shared by prosecutors who charged officer Van Dyke with first-degree murder in November.
While the charges and release of footage is recent, the killing happened in October 2014, mere months after the death of Michael Brown last summer at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo. Brown’s death was not captured on video.

Even after another student from John Browne High School in Queens admitted to the crime and all charges against Biswas were dropped, the honor student was suspended from school and forced to attend what the suit calls the equivalent of a reform school.
Biswas’ lawsuit was filed in the US District Court Southern District of New York.

According to court documents, Biswas was arrested, handcuffed, processed and imprisoned for more than 24 hours. The suit alleges that she was arrested and mistreated in spite of the fact that there was no evidence against her as a result of ethnic bias.

A Chemung County grand jury indicted Billy J. McGinnis, 35, of Chestnut Street in Elmira, on two counts of second-degree assault, a felony.
The charges stem from an incident that occurred Nov. 14 in the City of Elmira.
Officer Joshua Pratt, of the Elmira Police Department, attempted to conduct a traffic stop around 4:30 p.m. that day in the area of Partridge Street on the city's Southside, according to the indictment.
Rather than stop as ordered, McGinnis intentionally drove his vehicle toward Pratt and struck him, causing painful injuries, the indictment stated.
Police determined the vehicle was registered to a Broome County resident, who told investigators from Elmira the car had been stolen.
The officer's injuries were not life-threatening, according to the Elmira Police Department. Police eventually tracked McGinnis to a residence in the 200 block of Chestnut Street several hours after the incident, and took him into custody.
Police initially charged McGinnis with attempted murder. He remains in custody at the Chemung County Jail.

This week, a six-member jury with one alternate will decide whether Loveland police Sgt. Justin Chase is guilty of misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault and harassment.
They'll ponder whether injuries to Timothy Jarrett's face were caused by excessive force or could have been self-inflicted in an incident Nov. 5, 2016, when he was being arrested by police.
Chase pleaded not guilty in June to the charges, and his trial began Tuesday.
The Larimer County District Attorney's Office, at the request of the Loveland Police Department, investigated the allegations of excessive force and presented the results to a grand jury, which indicted Chase on the charges.
Not only is the convening of a grand jury in Larimer County rare, but so are criminal charges against a police officer for an on-duty incident involving use of force. The Loveland city attorney's office doesn't keep records of criminal cases against police officers, but according to the Loveland Police Department Professional Standards Unit, Chase is the only officer from that city in at least a decade to be criminally charged for an on-duty incident involving use of force.
The jury of six women and one man, along with defense attorneys and prosecutors, watched dashboard camera footage and listened to audio from Chase and Jarrett's interaction at McKee Medical Center following Jarrett's arrest.
Jarrett also testified Tuesday afternoon.
In prosecutors' opening arguments, Joanne Morando focused on the "extra strikes" that she said Chase gave to Jarrett when he was in the police patrol vehicle

When thinking of the Hamptons, glitz and glamour are certainly two things that come to mind…edgy, experimental DJs, not so much. On the contrary, uncovering such a treasure is what makes DJ Vibe all the more interesting. The Hamptons native, NYU graduate with a masters in music technology has worked with acclaimed labels like Def Jam. Likewise, he has made quite a name for himself among the underground DJ circuit. As a testament to his success, the DJ is currently in Japan doing parties and cutting tracks with Japan’s finest.
Intrigued with this beguiling world trotting talent after his music came to our attention we decided to sit down and put DJ Vibe otherwise known as Zach Hellman through his paces. What follows is an intriguing take on the world of DJ-ing and that of one of its current masters.
I started playing piano and bass guitar at 10 and began DJing at 14.
– Your music is a mixture between hip hop and techno. Why this genre? Who are your influences?
I don’t consider my music to be under any genre, because I play everything. I have found that musical genres mean little to DJs, and this ambiguity is what makes talented DJs such interesting people. DJs are blessed with an ability to merge genres, leaving nomenclature irrelevant. I believe this is what attracted me to spinning

Well, we have an idea you’re going to absolutely love.
It’s a unique approach to side gigs that may help you get out of your rut and start making some more money.
WTF does “middle manning” a side gig mean?
Here’s a true story from one of our Opt Out crew that will demonstrate it.
Mike Kamo worked in the family business selling cars right out of school. He spent 8 years working nights and weekends and climbing his way to a managerial role. But these days, he’s far from the world of car lots and long weekends.
While Mike has an awesome story of how he went from car dealer to a leader in the digital marketing world, when he visited the studio he told us the perfect “middle man” story.
It goes back to when he was just breaking free from the car business and needed a side hustle to make some money.
Infographics? I can sell those.
Mike noticed how successful they were, and asked to create one for a client. Not long after, he had more clients asking him to create infographics for their companies. He charged several thousand dollars each to create these infographics.
But, here’s the thing: Mike isn’t a graphics wiz. In fact, he just hired a contractor on Upwork to create it for him. Yup. He paid a few hundred bucks for someone to do the work, and then charged his clients thousands for the finished product.

Today we’ll talk about your wedding DJ.
Definitely an incredibly important element to your wedding reception, you should never skimp on choosing your professional DJ. Often I see this area become more of a price point issue instead of choosing someone who you feel confident in producing great entertainment for you and your guests.
Reasons why you should love your DJ?
They have to please you (the clients) and 250 of your closest family and friends. Think that is easy?
DJ’s really put themselves out there…they have nerves of steel.
They leave themselves wide open for audience interpretation of their job performance. Some guests may love what they are playing and some guests may not. You know what we’re saying, you’ve heard the “cool people” that have to complain about the music. But DJ’s have to keep on going and never waver.
It doesn’t matter what is going on in their personal lives or if they had a bad day; they show up to your wedding with a smile and positive energy.
They really care about getting it right for you, making sure you have all the songs that are your favorite in their database.
They honestly feel horrible if something goes wrong; like the speakers have a feedback or they accidently pronounced a name wrong. They are human. And equipment can falter. But trust me, they feel terrible when this happens.

Every true artist has their defining moment. It’s that moment where we use the cumulation our talents, skills, and abilities to produce some of the greatest work we have ever created. This is perhaps true for Andrew Bayer who poured his heart and soul into his new artist album In My Last Life.
Comparatively, In My Last Life is like a dreamy lullaby mix of beautiful vocals and peaceful trance melodies influenced by the sounds of Kate Bush, Atoms for Peace, and Aphex Twin. Andrew’s gentle rhythm creates a blissful atmosphere allowing listeners to feel uplifted by perhaps it’s light vocals or melody and a consistent bass line. The album also features vocals from Norwegian singer/songwriter Ane Brun and Alison May.
Additionally, his track “Immortal Lover” featured on the album is being re-played by artists like Above and Beyond on stages as big as Tomorrowland 2018.
In particular, Andrew’s use of different instruments for each song gives his sound a very unique, almost euphoric feel. Andrew first got into music production via the PlayStation game “MTV’s Music Generator” which inspired him to then buy a sequencer and learn the craft. A trip to Germany in the 8th grade really introduced him to some of the classic trance sounds like System F “Out Of The Blue”. He became obsessed with cataloging illegal downloads of music, which quickly put Andrew on a path to learning production. He’s produced several artist albums, even Grammy nominated for his production work with Above and Beyond. Meanwhile, as

As a matter of fact, the opinion of your guests depends on many factors and the first one is how much they love you ! Indeed, you can always find guests that are unhappy with everything. My best advice is to make a wedding that reflects who you are and your music choices are part of it!
Thus, if you live far from the country where you are going to celebrate your wedding, you have two options. The first one is to select a DJ in your own country, someone you know, who you have tested before. Usually, it is possible if you live in London and if your wedding is in France, but if you live in USA, the budget for the DJ will be huge. So the best, as far as I am concerned, is to find a local DJ for your wedding.
You can obviously ask your wedding planner, the wedding venue manager or look for wedding DJs on the internet. Then, the best is to speak with him or her about your personnal tastes. The wedding DJs are usually flexible as they believe that the most important is that guests dance.

What are some of those which you should absolutely avoid when working with your wedding DJ? We have gathered them right below – so read on and find out more.
A DJ’s job is easy and not so time consuming. You may feel you are paying your DJ only for the few hours he spends at your wedding. However, you should also consider the prep time, the time he spends on the phone and emailing you, meeting with you, unloading and setting up, and so on. In total, a DJ can work up to 18 hours (and more) for one wedding alone.
You have to give your DJ a playlist. No, you don’t – what would his job be, then? What we strongly advise you to do though is talk to your DJ about the “must play” and “mustn’t play” songs, so that he knows how to incorporate this into the big day.
You shouldn’t allow your DJ to take requests. In fact, allowing your DJ to take requests is more than recommended, as this will help him determine what kind of songs people want to dance on. Remember, he is not obliged to act upon all the requests, though – he should also filter through all these suggestions and select only the ones that

2 What to Do if Your CNA Certificate Is Expired?
Veterinary technicians care for animal patients under the supervision of a veterinarian. Because the work directly affects the well-being of the animals, each state requires the professionals to acquire training, pass a licensing exam, and maintain a valid license. There are penalties for failing to renew a veterinarian technician license on time. However, they are less severe for those techs who can renew theirs as close to the specified date as possible.
The renewal period for veterinary technician licenses varies by state, but it is typically one to two years after initial certification or after the last renewal. You can check your license for the renewal date to determine the number of days past the reissue date. Many states provide a grace period in which you can renew without a penalty. If your state does this, you can submit an application for renewal without any repercussions. Contact the regulating agency for veterinary technicians in your state to determine whether you are within this grace period. You could also check any renewal notification the office might have sent, or search for this information on the agency's website.

I'm not doing this to promote a healthy lifestyle, low inflammation, less bloating, or animal cruelty, I'm doing this to run faster.
Given the relative success I have had as a vegan I think I might continue this experiement after Chicago. I'm considering making it 100 days. That will free me up for turkey on Thanksgiving and other meals for Christmas yet allow me to see how I recover from a marathon.
That being said, when this does end I think I will continue indefinitely on a plant based diet. Not a catchy name, and very inclusive of all food, but really putting the focus on vegetables and whole grains. I think most of the health benefits of a vegan diet are from the higher consumption of vegetables and fruits rather than the elimination of meat and dairy.
As a side note, cravings do fade away. I have not salivated over steak in some time. It is even easier to walk past the cheese aisle now.

On this particular flight, we were in a non-pressurized twin, repositioning it to pick up our passengers. It was a cold morning, and I was a complete newbie to the multi-engine training. My instructor had no need for a copilot, and certainly not for a student, but the owner of the airplane felt it made passengers more comfortable if there were two people in the front.
I was in the left seat for the repositioning flight (free, loggable ME time). Shortly after takeoff, I could hear the dissonance of the engines going out of synch. I loudly asked, "What’s that?” (I confess to having used more colorful language in posting the question.) “Identify! Dead foot dead engine.” And thus, a flight lesson was commencing.
I was already well behind the cranial power curve. I had no idea what she was talking about. Like much of my training at that point, I was in the middle of a flight lesson that did not follow a lesson brief: What are we going to do, and how do we do it?
You can probably imagine the sequence of events that followed. She walked me through the process of confirming the failed engine, pulling back the throttle and mixture controls on that side, trimming to overcome the imbalanced thrust, etc. It was all SOP. Except, I had never read about MEL SOP.

P.S. I also think Spencer gets it largely wrong in this Danger Room post as well. I am not sure why advocating for resource-intensive counterinsurgency campaigns to salvage what were rapidly deteriorating situations in Iraq and Afghanistan necessarily means that scholars and practitioners working at CNAS would continue to push for the same capabilities to wage such campaigns after a transition in Afghanistan. You might have needed capabilities and resources in 2007 that you will not need in 2017.

Well, a funny thing happened and housing did continue slumping into 2008, as we all know well, and we did take advantage of what I had forecast and hoped for. Flor and I ended up buying a condo in 2008 after all. We made an offer in late April and were in the underwriting process this time last year, finally closing in July.

Review your investment setup. This is a good chance to check your investment options and ensure they will continue to meet your needs now and in the near future. Some people prefer to move to a more conservative strategy to protect their balance; others may move into higher-growth options to give their balance a boost.
Consider when you want to retire. While your account balance might permit you retiring early, doing it before you reach your preservation age means that you’ll likely pay a higher tax rate on your super benefits than if you’d waited. Likewise, if you want to continue working, you can no longer make super contributions after the age of 75 so you need a plan for accessing that money.

The bible’s teachings on Jesus’ resurrection leaves my mind in knots. It insists that Jesus rose from the dead and that his tomb was empty. But it doesn’t really tell us what resurrection means. Was it simply the resuscitation of a dead corpse? Surely not. There are other stories in the scriptures of people who were brought back to life after their death, but they had to face death again. Not so for Jesus. The bible says that he died once and that he will never die again. So his resurrection is more than a resuscitation. Was Jesus’ resurrected body a physical one? The scriptures are, again, either not clear on this or perhaps even at odds on the subject. The resurrected Jesus could be touched and ate food, implying physicality much like our own. But he also had the ability to either walk through closed, locked doors or to “beam” himself great distances at will. Plus, according to some accounts, he had the ability to disguise his physical appearance so that no one knew who he was until he chose to reveal himself. These accounts are quite foreign to our understanding of physicality. And then, while the gospels seem to insist that Jesus physically rose from the grave, the apostle Paul said that Jesus had a spiritual body, yet, Paul doesn’t really tell us what that means.

At michaframp Trading, we will just observe the action around that area to decide what to do. We are currently in a long trade. We might look to close the trade if price proves to fall. But we might add on another long position if price proves to have a strong momentum upward.

So why do you sometimes get confused about whether you need to add “had” to your past tense sentence? That is, why is it hard to figure out whether to write “I had called him about the invoice” vs. “I called him about the invoice”? In this post, we’re going to talk about when to use “had” when talking about the past.
To talk about when to use “had,” we need to talk about verb tenses. We know that verb tenses aren’t the most riveting of topics, so we’ll try to make this as bearable as possible. And to do this, we’ll focus on just two verb tenses: past perfect tense and simple perfect tense (what you think of as regular past tense).
As this sentence shows, we write verbs in the past perfect tense by attaching “had” to the regular past tense version of the main verb (i.e., “called”).
And when do we use the past perfect tense? When we’re talking about an event in the past that happened before a more recent past event. The example sentence above says that two things happened: (1) I called Matt about the invoice, and (2) we received the cheque. But these two events didn’t happen at the same time. Instead, I first called Matt. And then at some point after I did that, the cheque arrived. When you need to talk

The kernel power event ID 41 error occurs when the computer is shut down, or it restarts unexpectedly. When a computer that is running Windows starts, a check is performed to determine whether the computer was shut down cleanly. If the computer was not shut down cleanly, a Kernel Power Event 41 message is generated.
An event 41 is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly. There may be insufficient information to explicitly define what happened. To determine what may have happened and to identify a potential resolution, it is important to know what the computer was doing at the time just before the event occurred.
If event 41 is logged because power to the computer was interrupted, consider obtaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) such as a battery backup power supply. An underpowered or failing power supply may cause this behavior. For example, if you added RAM or additional devices or hard disks when this problem began, the power supply may cause the problem.

It appears that there is a preponderance of evidence that the "Roswell Crash" involved one or more ET entity manned vehicles. The government cover-up appears to have been unmasked.

Acknowledge the event. Pretending that nothing happened may seem like the easiest thing to do, but it will not help affected individuals recover. You may want to acknowledge the event with a small ritual, such as sending flowers or making a donation.
Don't ask questions, just listen. Asking detailed questions about what happened usually comes across as intrusive. If your friend/family member wants to talk about the event, just listen. He or she may repeat the details many times; this is often an important part of healing. But if he or she is not yet ready to talk about it. Don't.

Additionally, you might have noticed several physical symptoms. Do you have trouble falling and staying asleep? Does your heart race for no discernable reason? Are you experiencing a lot of aches and pains with no obvious source?
These symptoms may be relatively new, or they may have lasted for months. They may have even started having negative effects on your everyday life. At this point, you’d probably like to know how to manage them and live a normal life.
Whether it’s something more common (such as a bad breakup or the loss of a job) or something major (like living through a natural disaster), most people will experience traumatic events. In fact, an estimated 70 percent of adults deal with the effects of trauma.
When something traumatic happens, the brain suddenly switches gears from regular maintenance and repair processes to red alert. Every bodily system abruptly changes in the interest of survival. As soon as the threat is over, this survival mode kicks off and recovery is underway. Normally natural healing processes kick in so that regular maintenance and repair processes can resume.
Sometimes though, the red alert seems to stay on. The healing processes don't fully kick in. The system is discombobulated so that reactions don’t fit what is going on. Various symptoms may appear

You can only reason from the event to the suspect. Until you know what happened, you cannot say who.
For both Dallas and 9/11, the feds produced a guilty party before they determined what happened. They said “Oswald” and “bin Laden” before they resolved basic questions about the crimes.

People often don’t know the value of an object until they have an expert analyze it – the same is true for surveillance video.
A forensic engineer or “engineering expert” is often brought onboard in the claim/case process to help determine “what happened” or “how something happened”. If the incident or accident is captured on video, frequently it is assumed that an engineer is not needed. “Why do we need an engineer to explain to us what happened, when we have it right here on tape” is commonly the mindset. The reasoning is that engineers are used to “reconstructing” accidents, if the incident is on tape then no reconstruction is necessary. In actuality, the reverse is usually true. Having video evidence to work with is often when an engineer can provide the greatest assistance.
Forensic engineers are always trying to eliminate variables and elucidate hard facts regarding an incident. The fewer variables, or unknowns, and the more facts they are working with, the more accurate their findings can be. An engineer reconstructing an accident would always prefer to have access to the vehicle involved in the crash rather than try to reconstruct the accident from some photos and repair receipts. Similarly, having access to video of an incident can be invaluable to an engineer and his clients. Surveillance videos often contain invaluable information that can only be brought out with in-depth analysis techniques (such as frame-by-frame analysis) combined with engineering analysis.

after a traumatic experience it is common to have difficulties sleeping due to nightmares or due to mentally going over details of the event.
Feeling constantly anxious after a trauma is very common.
Sometimes these feelings turn into anxiety disorders such as PTSD or panic attacks. Even if you handled stress very well before your experience, many people find stress harder to manage after a traumatic event..
Feeling angry after a trauma is very common. You might be angry at the person who traumatized you, at the event itself or even at the world.
This can lead to outbursts and other anger management issues.
Many people fall into a depression after experiencing something very distressing.
You can be left wondering why the event happened to you - leading to dark moods and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts.

In the previous quizzes we have studied past tenses and present tenses. In this High English quiz we look at the different future tense forms - simple, perfect and continuous.
When we talk about the past or the present we are able to describe actions that have happened or that have happened in the past and are continuing now and may continue into the future. It is easier to talk about the past as there is certainty about the events that have taken place. Events in the present are a continuation of the events that have happened in the past and there is some order of certainty about them as well. However, when it comes to talking about the future there is no certainty but only probabilities or possibilities, depending on what we may think is likely to happen or what we plan or intend to do in the future.
The first of these sentences is in the simple future tense, the second is in the future continuous tense and the third is in the future perfect tense. Notice the different forms of the verb TO SEE. In all the cases the negative sentences can also be formed by using the word ‘not’ after ‘will/shall.’ Also, interrogative sentences are possible by placing the ‘will/shall’ before the subject.
We may note the differences in the time elements in respect of the different tense forms. In simple future tense we express an action/event likely

Counterfactual imaginings are known to have far reaching implications. In the present experiment, we ask if imagining events from one's past can affect memory for childhood events. We draw on the social psychology literature showing that imagining a future event increases the subjective likelihood that the event will occur. The concepts of cognitive availability and the source monitoring framework provide reasons to expect that imagination may inflate confidence that a childhood event occurred. However, people routinely produce myriad counterfactual imaginings (i.e., daydreams and fantasies) but usually do not confuse them with past experiences. To determine the effects of imagining a childhood event, we pretested subjects on how confident they were that a number of childhood events had happened, asked them to imagine some of those events, and then gathered new confidence measures. For each of the target items, imagination inflated confidence that the event had occurred in childhood. We discuss implications for situations in which imagination is used as an aid in searching for presumably lost memories.
People often imagine the past as being different from what it really was. Many investigators have argued that people spontaneously imagine alternatives to real events more in some settings than in others. These mental musings, called counterfactual thinking, have far reaching implications. They influence, for example, judgments of regret, perceived happiness, and causality (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). For example, in one study subjects assigned more blame to an individual for a bad outcome when counterfactual

A reflective essay is a relatively new requirement in some subjects, and requires the writer to think about their experience in a way which relates that experience to relevant theory and which may also involve questioning how you typically do something. Such an essay should integrate theory with personal or group practice, and often involves identifying the learning outcomes of a situation. Reflective essays are generally written about an area of professional practice relevant to the author, for example nurses might look at how they interact with patients on a ward. Reflective essays tend to be shorter than standard academic essays, and the use of ‘I’ or ‘we’ is acceptable (in contrast to normal academic style).
This link examines the differences between standard essays and reflective essays.
Be aware of the need to relate practice back to theory. How did events compare with the predictions made by theoretical models? How can events help you to understand theory?
Because reflective essays involve writing about your experience, it is good practice to keep a personal journal to document events and your reactions to them.

So why do you sometimes get confused about whether you need to add “had” to your past tense sentence? That is, why is it hard to figure out whether to write “I had called him about the invoice” vs. “I called him about the invoice”? In this post, we’re going to talk about when to use “had” when talking about the past.
To talk about when to use “had,” we need to talk about verb tenses. We know that verb tenses aren’t the most riveting of topics, so we’ll try to make this as bearable as possible. And to do this, we’ll focus on just two verb tenses: past perfect tense and simple perfect tense (what you think of as regular past tense).
As this sentence shows, we write verbs in the past perfect tense by attaching “had” to the regular past tense version of the main verb (i.e., “called”).
And when do we use the past perfect tense? When we’re talking about an event in the past that happened before a more recent past event. The example sentence above says that two things happened: (1) I called Matt about the invoice, and (2) we received the cheque. But these two events didn’t happen at the same time. Instead, I first called Matt. And then at some point after I did that, the cheque arrived. When you need to talk

If the computer was not shut down cleanly, a Kernel Power Event 41 message is generated.
An event 41 is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly. There may be insufficient information to explicitly define what happened. To determine what may have happened and to identify a potential resolution, it is important to know what the computer was doing at the time just before the event occurred.
If event 41 is logged because power to the computer was interrupted, consider obtaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) such as a battery backup power supply.

Their conclusions are suspect because no investigator would ever reach a conclusion about who committed a crime, before knowing what happened. The two questions are related, of course, but one of them takes precedence. You cannot reason from the suspect to the event. Many people could have a motive for the same act. You can only reason from the event to the suspect. Until you know what happened, you cannot say who.
For both Dallas and 9/11, the feds produced a guilty party before they determined what happened. They said “Oswald” and “bin Laden” before they resolved basic questions about the crimes. When you watch a police procedural or read a mystery, you know that if the investigators become drawn to one theory of the case too early in the investigation, they’re going to get it wrong. That’s part of the drama: the discipline investigators employ to avoid jumping to the wrong conclusion. That’s why we like to read, or watch, Sherlock Holmes. Holmes gets it right, because he asks questions, gathers information and reaches conclusions in the right order.
Note that not one of these nine points involves questions about who killed the president. They do not address motives, weapons used, event planning, conspiracy theories, alibis, cover-ups, investigative methods, reliability of witnesses, or evaluation of evidence.

People often don’t know the value of an object until they have an expert analyze it – the same is true for surveillance video.
A forensic engineer or “engineering expert” is often brought onboard in the claim/case process to help determine “what happened” or “how something happened”. If the incident or accident is captured on video, frequently it is assumed that an engineer is not needed. “Why do we need an engineer to explain to us what happened, when we have it right here on tape” is commonly the mindset. The reasoning is that engineers are used to “reconstructing” accidents, if the incident is on tape then no reconstruction is necessary. In actuality, the reverse is usually true. Having video evidence to work with is often when an engineer can provide the greatest assistance.
Forensic engineers are always trying to eliminate variables and elucidate hard facts regarding an incident. The fewer variables, or unknowns, and the more facts they are working with, the more accurate their findings can be. An engineer reconstructing an accident would always prefer to have access to the vehicle involved in the crash rather than try to reconstruct the accident from some photos and repair receipts. Similarly, having access to video of an incident can be invaluable to an engineer and his clients. Surveillance videos often contain invaluable information that can only be brought out with in-depth analysis techniques (such as frame-by-frame analysis) combined with engineering analysis.

When we talk about the past or the present we are able to describe actions that have happened or that have happened in the past and are continuing now and may continue into the future. It is easier to talk about the past as there is certainty about the events that have taken place. Events in the present are a continuation of the events that have happened in the past and there is some order of certainty about them as well. However, when it comes to talking about the future there is no certainty but only probabilities or possibilities, depending on what we may think is likely to happen or what we plan or intend to do in the future.
The first of these sentences is in the simple future tense, the second is in the future continuous tense and the third is in the future perfect tense. Notice the different forms of the verb TO SEE. In all the cases the negative sentences can also be formed by using the word ‘not’ after ‘will/shall.’ Also, interrogative sentences are possible by placing the ‘will/shall’ before the subject.

Counterfactual imaginings are known to have far reaching implications. In the present experiment, we ask if imagining events from one's past can affect memory for childhood events. We draw on the social psychology literature showing that imagining a future event increases the subjective likelihood that the event will occur. The concepts of cognitive availability and the source monitoring framework provide reasons to expect that imagination may inflate confidence that a childhood event occurred. However, people routinely produce myriad counterfactual imaginings (i.e., daydreams and fantasies) but usually do not confuse them with past experiences. To determine the effects of imagining a childhood event, we pretested subjects on how confident they were that a number of childhood events had happened, asked them to imagine some of those events, and then gathered new confidence measures. For each of the target items, imagination inflated confidence that the event had occurred in childhood. We discuss implications for situations in which imagination is used as an aid in searching for presumably lost memories.
People often imagine the past as being different from what it really was. Many investigators have argued that people spontaneously imagine alternatives to real events more in some settings than in others. These mental musings, called counterfactual thinking, have far reaching implications. They influence, for example, judgments of regret, perceived happiness, and causality (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). For example, in one study subjects assigned more blame to an individual for a bad outcome when counterfactual

Such an essay should integrate theory with personal or group practice, and often involves identifying the learning outcomes of a situation. Reflective essays are generally written about an area of professional practice relevant to the author, for example nurses might look at how they interact with patients on a ward. Reflective essays tend to be shorter than standard academic essays, and the use of ‘I’ or ‘we’ is acceptable (in contrast to normal academic style).
This link examines the differences between standard essays and reflective essays.
Be aware of the need to relate practice back to theory. How did events compare with the predictions made by theoretical models? How can events help you to understand theory?

Where do you find furniture that fits your personality? These days, you can tag any type of furniture with a keyword you’re searching for, and you can find a match. Just think about what you like, and then you can begin taking a look around. For example, some of my interests are writing, movies, baseball and investing. So what type of furniture would I be looking for?
As a writer and an investor, I can tell you wooden furniture that matches my personality might come in a mahogany or cherry wood. That’s just off the top of my head, but I do like those woods. I also like oak and other woods, too. If I were to search furniture associated with baseball or movies, I would land on some specific furniture choices, too, but I likely wouldn’t want to be that direct.
You never know though until you search. You might find some good furniture with direct keyword searches as I mentioned earlier, depending on your interests. Or you might want to come up with tangents like I did with the mahogany and cherry wood matching my writing and investing. There are so many options when it comes to furniture, looking in person or online at what color wood you like will really narrow down your results. Another big decision is deciding what type of countertops you want in your home to match the furniture you choose. Do you like light marble, dark or maybe a granite? Looking at all

People might not react in the same way to the event because they see it in different ways and mean different things to them, which can have result in very different feelings. We use the word appraisal to refer to this process.
Whether an event is seen as stressful depends on two types of appraisal. The first type, primary appraisal, is deciding whether the situation is a problem or not. Imagine that a friend asks you to take part in a fun run for charity. You might think: “Oh no, I can’t do that, I’m not fit and I’ll just make a fool of myself.” Or you might think: “Oh good, what a great way to help. Even if I have to walk round, I’ll be able to collect some money”. So for the first person, the event would be stressful, and for the second a happy event.
The second type of appraisal secondary appraisal, is whether you think you can cope with the problem. This means looking at your own strengths and how you have coped previously, if you can get help from people around you.
In the example of the fun run, the first person might know that they are unfit and unlikely to be able to finish even by walking round. This belief of their lack of strength makes the situation seem difficult. And maybe the second

When it comes to blood transfusions, what’s good for one person might be deadly for another.
This might seem obvious today, but until 1900 the idea of “blood types” wasn’t understood. A person in need of a transfusion could find himself getting a donation from just about anyone, and sometimes even an animal!
After hundreds of years of performing blood transfusions unguided, scientists finally had what they needed to safely transfer blood between people. In 1907, the first blood transfusion utilizing the new typing techniques was successfully carried out, and by World War I transfusions were being performed safely on a large scale.
But knowing what blood to give someone and having it on hand are two different things.
Blood banks are faced with the daunting task of making sure there is enough blood of the right type for everyone who needs it at all times. Blood type O, the “universal donor,” tends to be overused. This presents a problem for the approximately 40% of Americans are type O and thus can receive only this type in a transfusion. If supplies run low, their lives could be in danger. At the same time, donated blood with the rare B and AB types can sit unused for so long that it becomes outdated and must be discarded.
One solution to managing the blood supply would be to transform all blood into type O, thus making it suitable for everyone. In the early 1980’s scientists found a way to do this using

Re: Why incompatible types at subset contraints?
If some QualityTest is involved in some PerformedQualityTest then that QualityTest is involved in that PerformedQualityTest that has been promised.
Unfortunately, there are a couple of tooling issues with this. First, I'm not automatically finding the join path over the first role sequence. Second is that the validation is giving a bogus error regarding intersection with a mandatory constraint (the constraint validation engine hasn't caught up to the nuances of join paths).
Having said that, as I'm looking at the model I'm not sure that this is best solved with some modeling adjustments. For example, are the observations and performance date really roles of the QualityTest (a type of test) or PerformedQualityTest (an execution of, or instance, of that test). If you move the QualityTest role players for the two binary fact types to the objectified unary then you'll be in business.
I also question why PerformedQualityTest objectifies a unary. This is implying that only one performance of each test can exist in your data.

How much time do we have in which to have the conversation? If it’s less time, we’ll probably go with the selective interview. If we have a little more time, we might go with a cognitive interview.
Is this the type of investigation where the subject might say, “Yes, I did it, but I didn’t know it was wrong”? If so, maybe we include participatory interview techniques in order to walk them into telling us they had the intent to commit the act.
Or, maybe we just go directly into the WZ method.
We anticipate denials. What type of objections or explanatory denials are we going to get based on the investigation and the person we’re talking to? What rationalizations are we going to have to use to overcome their fears and hurdles?

Correcting punctuation for grammar and clarity is a key part of any copy editor’s job, but commas also play a role in shaping elements of writing that aren’t as simple as “correct” and “incorrect” usage. The comma, we’re often told, corresponds to a “slight pause” in oral delivery—and it’s not uncommon, in a room of editors hard at work, to hear a low muttering as someone tries out a particular phrase, listening for that tell-tale pause to confirm their punctuation choices.
As David Crystal explains in his Making a Point: The Persnickety Story of English Punctuation (St. Martin’s Press, 2015), punctuation choices have a complicated relation to the spoken word. After all, most English speakers don’t put space between words. Thus, Crystal identifies many functions for the comma, including the “psycholinguistic”: “it gives the reader time to assimilate, time to mentally breathe” (p. 236).
The comma is historically linked to the publishing and editing process. The technical origins of the device, and its name, apparently look back to a certain Aristophanes of Byzantium in the 3rd century BCE, who added dots to written (Greek) text to indicate where a speaker should pause for breath (a short passage, marked by a dot at mid-line height, was called a komma). In Latin writing, punctuation, and even spacing between words, was not seen as necessary during the Middle Ages, and most manuscripts are in scripto continua, providing a

Everyone tells you when you edit scene objects in play mode they are lost when you stop the play – it’s a lie! Well partly, a true lie but there is a way you can save those edits!
Still in play mode, click and highlight the game object in the hierarchy that you changed.
Hit CTRL+C to copy the game object (Command+C on Mac).
Stop playing the scene (CTRL+P or click the play button to stop).
Hit CTRL+V (Command+V) to paste the object in the hierarchy window.
You now have another copy of that game object, which also has the edits you had made in play mode. Delete the old object. Yes this copies all its children too.
Hit the pause button, or use Debug.Break(); in your code to pause, OR use CTRL+SHIFT+P keyboard shortcut to pause at any time (Command+SHIFT+P on Mac).
Step through using the CTRL+ALT+P keyboard shortcut (Command+ALT+P on Mac).
Great for debugging timings, animations and lots more.
When you are running your game, any changes you make to objects in the inspector are temporary and are lost when you stop running. You WILL find you forget you’re running once in a while and lose your changes!

In this report the stresses were put so exactly, the plot was retold in details, so Gursky's decided: there is no need to write a novel about yankee (everything is already clear), it is better to begin two new books: "To Kill a President" and "Change of Place". The novels were written quickly and at the beginning of the next year they were published. "Danger", "Stake on the Black" and other novels were the next. They were published and republished in many places - the geography was from Khar'kov to Novosibirsk. Along side there were numerous interviews, anger of prototypes (true and self-styled), arguments in press (printed and not), slights of friends, compliments of enemies. Then in 1999 goes the TV series "Detective Dubrovsky Dossier" (it was based on the novel "Change of Place", the director was Alexander Muratov). Then it was a long pause, which lasted for 4 years.

So we slide into perfectionism. We get intimidated. We forget that mindfulness is very much part of our evolutionary heritage.
Now, why is it so hard to do such a simple thing as taking a pause to be mindful? It really helps to understand the obstacles, so we can be responsive rather than reactive to the challenges of life. Hint: When we have trouble doing something simple, chances are it might be a protective mechanism against a perceived threat.
In case this all feels a little abstract to you, here is a concrete example. This 30-send video shows why, for some of us, "listening" has a bad connotation. It's good to understand why, and to see how things can be different.

With a naive idea in mind about writing an office-based comic novel, I took some casual work in the City, partly to research, partly to make ends meet, and partly as I knew not what else to do with my life.

However, reading is a solo activity in most cases, and completely internal. Two writers could read the same novel, and each come away with totally different opinions, skills, thoughts, etc.
Did they like a character? How was he/she developed? Did they like the end? Was it satisfying? What led up to it to, to make it so satisfying? Take notes on what they liked, then figure out why they liked it. Then you can take those elements and apply them to your own writing.
Did they hate the character they were supposed to root for? Was it because he/she was underdeveloped? Did they even finish the book? Why not? Pacing? Were they a fan of the genre to begin with? That last question is probably one of the most important to consider. I am not a big fan of crime novels, so, of course, I am not going to look favorably on it.

But besides teaching an online version of English 444 with some new elements that are keeping me busy, I’ve been going to a lot of meetings/workshops lately– all day Tuesday, Thursday and Friday of last week, half the day yesterday, half the day today, etc.. I’m moving offices this afternoon and tomorrow. I am slowly but surly working with Charlie Lowe on editing/putting together a collection of essays on MOOCs (more on that coming soon I am sure. ) And then there is all of the stuff in “life” around the gardens and the house, too.
So I have an excuse of sorts as to why I’ve had such a hard time keeping up with Composition I, and I really hit a wall with the third assignment, the “Case Study.” More below, but the short version is the whole course is just becoming more and more of a slog.
I didn’t have the time, energy, direction, or inclination to do anything to revise my “Visual Image Depicting Expertise” assignment (which was about this image), so I just turned it in as it was. If I had a nickel for every time one of my students did the same thing as a result of a vague peer review exercise I put together, well, I’d have a lot

To date I’ve been unable to authenticate this legend, but it doesn’t really matter whether or not it is true. I like to think it is, and I choose to think that for many reasons.
The main reason I like this story is that it tells me that I am not alone with my quirky propensities.
I have a propensity to keep everything I write. I’m not the only writer whose filing cabinet is filling up with unpublished, unpublishable writings. Why do we cling to these things? Because we may look at them some day and discover that they had mutated over the years into something useful?
This lore also tells me that even the great writers—the writers of legend—have dead end ideas, bad books, worthless prose. They don’t consider their every word golden, and neither should I. (Tony Hillerman says he has a whole file cabinet full of first chapters.) They practice their craft, and don’t subject their fans to their practicings. I thank them for that.
I wonder what went into that fire of Heinlein and Bradbury. What brilliant poetry, intriguing concepts from the minds of those two gentlemen will be forever lost to our body of American literature? With Heinlein long dead and Bradbury recently so, what would Christie’s get for those manuscript pages on the auction block?

We have a new favorite beer at Bungalow 44 in Mill Valley, CA that nobody can get enough of and we know why. It’s called Pliny the Elder, a delicious Double Indian Pale Ale from Russian River Brewing and Marin County loves Pliny!
Pliny the Elder is robust and well balanced with malt, hops, and alcohol, slightly bitter with a fresh hop aroma of floral, citrus and pine. It is best enjoyed FRESH and that is why they make it in a limited supply. They actually put the bottling date on each bottle. It is an insanely drinkable and balanced and this sets it apart from the other imperial IPA’s and we absolutely agree. Don’t forget about our fantastic selection of crafty specialty cocktails that are sure to make you smile.
It’s namesake is the Roman naturalist, scholar, historian, traveler, officer, and writer. Pliny and his contemporaries created the botanical name for hops, “lupus Salictarius”, meaning wolf among scrubs.”and who some folks say was one of the first people to write about hops. Pliny the Elder was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who wrote about his uncle succumbing to ash and smoke during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. while rescuing people. Cheers to the scholar, historian, officer, writer, and Roman Naturalist- Pliny the Elder!
Open daily at 5 p.m., Bungalow 44 is located in the heart of downtown Mill Valley. For reservations, please call our restaurant at 415-381-2500 or reserve your table online through Seat Me.

Last week, when I puttered out and skipped writing on Thanksgiving, I started wondering if I’d make it at all. I almost put off the final 1K words until tomorrow, but decided just to push on and get it all done tonight.
I feel like this is a pretty good point to pause in my writing, anyhow, as I’ve chewed through most of my loose plot-plans already. I need to really think about some of the developments I’m going to mess with the next stretch of the story. I’m not done with writing by a long shot, but I really do need a rest after all that. Whew!
I started blogging because I wanted to be a better writer and every year I toy with the idea of trying it, but I don’t have the confidence (yet). Maybe next year.
If 50K seems intimidating (it is), you might want to join in Camp NaNoWriMo instead! It happens at least twice a year and allows you to set your own word count goal. There were years that I did two 25K Camp NaNos, since that equals one full yearly NaNo. It’s a very good springboard to the bigger challenge if that’s something you’re interested in attempting!

As I read back through the parts I needed to change and considered what the active voice phrasing should be, it all rushed back to me. The moment I was describing, the moment of pressing, vulnerability, and the pain the followed.
Good writing should be, I think. Tears were streaming down my cheeks as I relived that moment. I couldn’t keep writing and rewriting. I had to pause and remember. The rush of feelings forced me. To pause.
In a world full of distractions, pausing is so much harder than it should be. Because pausing means pulling out and putting away all those distractions and sitting in the moment, sitting in the pain, sitting in whatever we are trying to avoid with all those distractions.
I do. So I must learn to pause, for there is where my feelings lie.
I agree, it can be so easy to distract ourselves with busyness, instead of pausing and actually acknowledging our feelings about certain things and working through the pain. It’s so beneficial though when we do take time to do that. Visiting from FMF.

Retrieved Text: Whether you are buying or selling a car, most people think that the only options they have are to use a dealer or to purchase from a private individual. However, auto auctions are a great way to get a good car, for a reasonable price in Oakland County, Michigan. If you are selling a car, an auto auction can often get you more money than you can get from a dealer. This is especially the case if you have a unique vehicle or a classic car. If you are shopping for a new car or looking to sell, here’s what you need to know about using an auto auction.
This is true for both the buyer and the seller in an auto auction. You cannot expect to get a vehicle for a particular price and if you are selling, the price that you hope to get, may not be what your vehicle sells for. If you understand that the sale price of every vehicle at an auction is variable, you are more likely to be successful at an auto auction. If you are selling a vehicle through an auction, make sure that you work closely with the auctioneer, to make sure that you fully understand the reasons for setting the starting price.
This is especially important for the individual purchasing a vehicle through auction. Vehicles will often be listed with some basic information prior to the auction. If you are interested in a particular vehicle, make sure that you do your research on the car’s make and model.

Determine an estimated value of your current vehicle. Edmunds.com and KBB.com (Kelley Blue Book) are good resources for establishing a base value of what your vehicle is worth. Make sure you are realistic about the condition of your vehicle as you enter the information and remember the valuation is simply an estimate. If you want a true valuation of your vehicle based on current market value, you will need to have it appraised at a dealership.
Remove all your personal items. Check under the seats, in every storage area and the glove box – twice. Then check again. You may be surprised at what you find.

Retrieved Text: Whether you are buying or selling a car, most people think that the only options they have are to use a dealer or to purchase from a private individual. However, auto auctions are a great way to get a good car, for a reasonable price in Oakland County, Michigan. If you are selling a car, an auto auction can often get you more money than you can get from a dealer. This is especially the case if you have a unique vehicle or a classic car. If you are shopping for a new car or looking to sell, here’s what you need to know about using an auto auction.
This is true for both the buyer and the seller in an auto auction. You cannot expect to get a vehicle for a particular price and if you are selling, the price that you hope to get, may not be what your vehicle sells for. If you understand that the sale price of every vehicle at an auction is variable, you are more likely to be successful at an auto auction. If you are selling a vehicle through an auction, make sure that you work closely with the auctioneer, to make sure that you fully understand the reasons for setting the starting price.
This is especially important for the individual purchasing a vehicle through auction. Vehicles will often be listed with some basic information prior to the auction. If you are interested in a particular vehicle, make sure that you do your research on the car’s make and model.

Aside from the jerseys. Is the organisation planning any more festivities?
I think we might still be a year away from any real festivities as the 50th anniversary falls in 2020. (The 40th anniversary jerseys were released in 2010, for reference.) With that said, it is widely believed there will at least be a new third jersey next year.
The team already came out and said they would be celebrating their 50th year this year. The Canucks also are.
Is this in case of lockout?
I never much liked the "goat head" but it was probably better than the "banana slug." Ironically, they had some of their greatest success with those two awful logos. I could see some kind of 3rd jersey honoring those past teams. I would prefer something dating back to the original logo from the early 70's (which isn't terribly different from the modified version they are using today) with the same type of stripes, laces in the collar, royal blue color, etc. from the 70's. Those are the true classics.

Important as it is, wedding anniversary also requires some unusual, outrageous and hilarious celebration with memorable presents. To help you take most of the day, we suggest you try the following wedding anniversary gift ideas.
First of all, try to recollect your “thing”, e.g. a moment out of your dating time, which is strongly set in the memory of both of you. This might be a walk under a pouring rain, some movie scene, the place of the first kiss or date, etc. So, on your wedding anniversary try to relive this moment over again and fill yourself with those memorable and reviving feelings.
Other wedding anniversary gift ideas will include a customized love book with thrilling poetry, a customized photo set, a personalized photo collage, or a beautifully colored family tree. You might also think of some beautiful painting, statue, etc. But make sure your present is full of meaning and your love. Otherwise, these wedding anniversary gift ideas and your efforts will be in vain.
Jewelry and accessories are the bound-to-be-liked anniversary gifts for women. Perfume may also do the trick. But do your best to present your beloved with her favorite odor. Men, on the other hand, will be happy to get some glamorous accessories that would show their social status. To these belong carved cigarette lighters, golden pens, designer trinkets, a set of ties, watches, etc.

Even if that's what an observer might guess from looking at his truck.
Olympius, a Costa Mesa resident who will join in the Classic Car Show during the city's 60th anniversary celebration, bought a 1955 Chevrolet three years ago with the intent of converting it to the kind of vehicle he waited for at the curb as a boy. The truck had gone through a few uses before he bought it: delivery for a bakery, advertising for a construction company, ambulance in Platte County, Neb.
Sometime during that third incarnation, the vehicle took on a mark that its new owner decided to keep.
"It had a bullet hole in one of the windows," Olympius said. "My wife said, 'You've got to fix that!' I said, 'No, it's part of the history.'"
As Costa Mesa celebrates its own history, plenty of automotive remnants from the past will be on hand as well. Olympius' ice-cream truck, cracked glass and all, will join other vehicles from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday in the Civic Center parking lot.

Kids have this tendency to feel like the entire day gets ruined from one bad moment. Unfortunately, adults have this problem, too, myself included. Sometimes we have this tendency to carry over the problems from yesterday or last week, or even years ago that become a chip on our shoulder.
There’s this temptation to just get away from our problems for a little while or try to forget that the chip on our shoulder doesn’t exist. A little escapism now and then isn’t bad, per se, but there’s that temptation to stay in that little place of escapism or wishing that the fantasy we escape into was real. If there’s anything I learned from Season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it’s that when you go out of your way to deny your problems, they end up becoming worse.
So when times get hard and you need to find motivation, what exactly do you do?

Retrieved Text: A Buffy movie without Joss Whedon? While some may be shouting that it's insane, immoral and just plain wrong, I have to admit: It sounds like a great idea to me. Here's why.
We've seen Joss do Buffy for seven years on television (and two years in comics, for that matter), and do Buffy really well for at least six of those years (I'm one of those people who was unconvinced by the relentless, seemingly-aimless angst of season six. Sorry); that's never going away, no matter what - You all have those DVDs and the reruns and the comics to prove it. But just because Joss created Buffy and did the franchise proud for more than a decade doesn't mean that someone else can't come up with something equally as interesting, and almost as enjoyable. For whatever reason - and this isn't the place to argue about whether or not it's a good thing - our culture has become endlessly recyclable, whether it's movie or TV show reboots or comics where every year sees a new writer, artist and "creative direction." By now, we've had enough Battlestar Galacticas, The Dark Knights and Alan Moore taking on Swamp Things to know that letting new voices take on familiar characters can end in wonderful new versions of old stories, and leave the characters all the better for the experience. Who's to say that a new writer or new director couldn't bring something unexpected and amazing to the Buffy mythos?

According to the recent British study published in Women and Religion in the West, young women have taken an increased interest in practicing witchcraft after Gellar’s hit U.S. TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer hit the mainstream.
The Church of England has declined to comment on the study.

In 1418 Cortona, Italy, the demon Moloch asks one of his followers if he loves him. When the follower says he does, Moloch snaps his neck, killing him. Elsewhere, a group of monks chant a spell to bind Moloch. They place his essence within the pages of a book. They close the book and bury it in a box, hoping that it will never be opened again.
In 20th century Sunnydale, Buffy opens a box and extracts the same book. The school's computer teacher, Ms. Calendar, is scanning some of the books into a computer. Willow and some of the other computer students are helping. Giles is suspicious and disparaging of this new-fangled way of preserving the knowledge in books. He says he needs to clean up some of the shelves and that he will be back in the Middle Ages. Ms. Calendar: "Did you ever leave?"

Sometimes we have this tendency to carry over the problems from yesterday or last week, or even years ago that become a chip on our shoulder.
There’s this temptation to just get away from our problems for a little while or try to forget that the chip on our shoulder doesn’t exist. A little escapism now and then isn’t bad, per se, but there’s that temptation to stay in that little place of escapism or wishing that the fantasy we escape into was real.

Sorry); that's never going away, no matter what - You all have those DVDs and the reruns and the comics to prove it. But just because Joss created Buffy and did the franchise proud for more than a decade doesn't mean that someone else can't come up with something equally as interesting, and almost as enjoyable. For whatever reason - and this isn't the place to argue about whether or not it's a good thing - our culture has become endlessly recyclable, whether it's movie or TV show reboots or comics where every year sees a new writer, artist and "creative direction."

Seriously, it's dangerous. Just look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 2 Episode 16! One little spell can muster a guilty pleasure episode, but it's also one about which many fans have mixed feelings.
Let's find out why by rewatching "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 2 Episode 16 was when Cordelia and Xander's relationship became official. Like, it was official official. If social media was around at this time, their first couple photo would be going up on Instagram right now with a cringe-worthy hashtag.
Still, what should be an easy decision for them felt like a chapter from Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story. They had to grow and overcome the challenges from their friend cliques to be together. From the outside, it was a tad heavy-handed.
Couldn't they just be together?
Obviously, I'm saying this as a 27-year-old as compared to a 7-year-old who watched it the first time around back in 1998. If I were still a kid, I wouldn't have had the guts to make that tough decision. Even Buffy's jabs at Xander would've been enough to make me doubt.
Xander: When are you guys gonna stop making fun of me for dating Cordelia?
Buffy: I'm sorry, but never. I just think you could find somebody more...better.

I am doing a Buffy rewatch.
Now, the particulars of this rewatch are flexible - I am 100% willing to accept feedback on how you might like this to go. I will say that these reviews will not be exhaustive in dealing with all parts of an episode.

But there's a lot of Buffy reviewers on Ye Olde Internet, and I'd like to retread as little as possible.

They are part of a collection, gifted to my dearest best friend, by me, on her birthday three years ago. They are also collecting dust, and therefore will be paraded out as review companions and also evidence of the nerdiest birthday gift ever created on this planet. But please don't take the haikus too seriously! They are for funsies only.

"I'm not going to sit down and shut up," Palin said during an interview in which she quoted Scriptures and Martin Luther King and commiserated with Hannity about the criticisms that both had endured in the days after the shooting. "I did not like being called a merchant of hate by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., " Hannity interjected.
Palin acknowledged that a now infamous map her political action committee published used cross-hairs to target Giffords and 19 other Democratic House members for ouster. That's a change from last week when an aide argued that the icons were surveyors' marks. But Palin argued that she was merely following standard political metaphors. "For many, many years, maps in political races have been used to target certain districts," she continued. "The graphic we used was crosshairs targeting the different districts.

In recent years, Danny Strong has become the go-to guy for political drama for HBO. He's gotten an Emmy nomination and Writers Guild of America award for his screenplay for the 2008 “Recount,” about the 2000 presidential vote in Florida. And now he's gone back to work with that film’s director, Jay Roach, on the anticipated adaptation of the controversial bestseller “Game Change,” which premieres on HBO Saturday. "Game Change" chronicles Sarah Palin's rise during the 2008 presidential race and features a superlative performance by Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin, along with Ed Harris as John McCain and Woody Harrelson as McCain’s senior strategist Steve Schmidt. It is already getting pushback from Republicans, who are calling it a political-year propaganda film.
Oddly enough, Strong began his entertainment career playing key roles in cult series – Jonathan Levinson on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”; Paris’ boyfriend on “Gilmore Girls”; the hopeful copywriter hired after Don Draper stole his idea on “Mad Men.” We caught up with him in Atlanta last week.

She accuses the media of manufacturing “blood libel” to incite the kind of violence that struck Tucson this past weekend.
Hopefully, Representative Giffords will recover swiftly and will be able to speak for herself very soon. While I don’t want to put words in the Jewish congresswoman’s mouth, Palin’s remarks are an insult to Ms Giffords and Jews everywhere. And they should be an insult to Christians, too. “Blood libel” refers to the medieval assertion that Jews used the blood of Christian children as an ingredient in cooking of matzoh - unleavened bread. It has become a popular tag line among anti-Semites both in ancient times and today.
I’m not accusing Sarah Palin of being anti-Semitic. But Ms. Palin is a professional communicator and I’m sure her YouTube videos and Facebook pronouncements are vetted by experienced message handlers. This inappropriate choice of words could not have been accidental.

Brooks is of the view that Jared Loughner is deeply disturbed (probably schizophrenic) and politically ambiguous.

Only problem was that, according to an Associated Press analysis, the lady maverick made some “racially tinged” remarks about Barack Obama. Someone might want to inform Sarah that although comments like that may play well in Wasilla, here in Southern California we celebrate diversity along with divisional championships.
Now back to the other primate.

What the Conspiracy Is: "Trig Trutherism holds that Trig's real mother is either Bristol Palin or some third party, and that Sarah Palin herself faked the pregnancy to avoid embarrassment for her daughter or for political gain or some combination of reasons," writes Elliott.
Why the Conspiracy Still Exists: People have been making claims that Sarah Palin is not actually the mother of 3-year-old Trig Palin since early 2008.

She's doing nothing wrong by cashing in on her few minutes of fame because it's all about money; she has a substantial following and do I want her finger on the launch button? No way.
Palin was not McCain's first choice for vice president, it was the Democratic turncoat Joe Lieberman. But the Christian right base of the Republican Party said "no way" and the untested Palin became the VP nominee.
From the beginning, Republican leadership and McCain campaign people were warned of her destructive influence and polarizing extremism. Until the "big money guys" can control and manipulate her, they are not going to support her in 2012. I see her going to work with Lou Dobbs at "Fox" with the other nuts.

Darrel Dobernecker, the mayor of Pella, then greeted the guests and welcomed the Palin’s calling her “a breath of fresh air.” The movie itself ran two hours long, and started with a montage of insults that came from Hollywood, liberal pundits and even in the mainstream media.

Ms May managed to placate some critics in the Commons and Lords by promising Parliament a vote on the Brexit terms she agrees, but sources indicated the country will leave the bloc even if her particular deal is rejected by MPs and Peers.
Such a move would probably mean the hardest kind of Brexit, with the UK leaving the EU without any successor agreement and reverting to World Trade Organisation rules - meaning MPs could be more likely to back whatever terms Ms May manages to achieve.
The landmark speech also saw the Prime Minister announce that the UK would leave the single market and try and negotiate a new free trade agreement with the European Union from the outside.
Addressing diplomats at Lancaster House she said: "When it comes to Parliament, there is one other way in which I would like to provide certainty.
"I can confirm today that the Government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force."
Government sources later said that the Prime Minister was "clear, we are leaving the EU" when asked what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal Ms May strikes.
The Prime Minister was also unequivocal in her speech, while urging EU leaders to strike a mutually-beneficial deal with the UK, that she was not afraid of leaving the bloc without any deal at all.

When a hitter has never faced a pitcher before, he’ll ask what the pitcher’s “out” pitch is; in other words, once the pitcher gets two strikes on the hitter, what does he throw to get the hitter out?
Once Skoglund got two strikes on a Tigers hitter, he continued to throw all three pitches; fastball, slider and curve. That meant the Tigers weren’t sure what to look for in a two-strike count and that meant Skoglund had an advantage.
Pitchers get charts that show hot and cold spots in a hitter’s swing and after enough trips to the plate, those hot and cold spots fill up. Then every pitcher in the league has a better idea of how to pitch that hitter.
The same thing happens to pitchers.
The smartest coaches and hitters in the world will study Skoglund and look for patterns; the more he pitches, the easier the patterns will be to spot and once they find those patterns, the hitters will have a better idea of how to attack the Royals rookie.
They’ll adjust to Skoglund and if he wants to stay in the big leagues, Skoglund will adjust back.

Last night the postal company itself admitted that at any one time nine million items of post were either delayed or caught up in the chaos. This means that one in every eight letters and parcels posted in a single day. This is nearly double the estimate of five million last week.
The Union believes the backlog now totals 25 million.
The figures come as the Communication Workers Union starts a formal ballot of 121,000 postal workers – nearly two thirds of the workforce – to see whether there is support for a national strike which will severely disrupt deliveries across the country in the run-up to Christmas.
The proposed strike would be the worst since 2007 when stoppages at Royal Mail accounted for nearly two thirds of all days lost to strikes in the economy that year.

Berrios had improved his first-pitch strike rate from last year's 55.2 percent to 65.8 percent, while throwing 65.9 percent of his pitches for strikes, making him look like a different pitcher than in 2016, when he posted an 8.02 ERA in 14 starts as a rookie.
But the 23-year-old's command troubles came back at an inopportune time for the Twins on Tuesday, as they were coming off their two roughest losses of the year when Berrios allowed a season-high four runs on five hits and four walks over five innings in a 7-2 loss to the Astros.
Berrios threw first-pitch strikes to 11 of the 23 batters he faced (47.8 percent), while throwing 63 of his 104 pitches for strikes (60.6 percent). And against a tough Astros lineup, it was too much to overcome despite pitching his way out of a few jams.
"It's tough, especially with a lineup like that," said Berrios, who fell to 3-1 with a 2.70 ERA. "But I never lost my confidence. I tried to compete every pitch. That happens. It's one bad night. You have to erase it and get on to the next one."
Berrios was hurt by his four walks and also hit Marwin Gonzalez with a pitch to open the third, with Gonzalez ending up coming around to score on a

Nine different girls, each one who felt they were alone in some way, that nobody understood them. A swimming champion who suffers an injury, a little girl who loses her grandmother, a family on the move to a different country, a dancer who thinks she is too fat. Each one tells a different story with the same message – communication is important and we must all find a connection to our true selves.
Connections to True Self: Short Stories for Girls by Sofia Michelle is a great book written by a teenage girl, with a story of her very own in between the pages. Each story is wonderfully told and each one has its own message. Each is written about a situation that may be very real to a child or young teen today and I especially liked “My Kind of Dance” and “Victory”. The addition at the end of each story of an illustration or a page to write about something connected with the story is a good idea as it makes children focus on what they read, what they feel and what they want. Short stories are not easy to write but Sofia has cracked it – every story has everything it should have; a plot, a great character and a message, so I take my hat off to her that. At the age of 10, she has achieved something that many adult authors fail to do.

With practical wisdom, she offers girls a peek behind the curtain to reveal what makes mean girls act the way they do and offers solid advice for responding in a way that doesn’t make your daughter a doormat, but takes the high road.

This child is a problem at home and in the classroom. He is impossible to control in every setting. He's the kid who bites the Easter Bunny and climbs over and under the pews at church. He's loud. He's easily angered. His parents have been on a first name basis with the school principal since Kindergarten.
While this image may be true for many children with ADHD, it is not the whole picture. The flaw in this description is two-fold. Not all boys with ADHD are hyperactive and not all children with ADHD are boys. Studies have shown that girls with ADHD are likely to go undiagnosed for up to five years longer than boys, placing many of them around age 12 before anyone begins to address the issues that have been present all along. To prevent this late diagnosis, it is important to understand and recognize the signs of attention deficit disorder girls.
While hyperactivity may be present in some attention deficit disorder girls during early childhood, these signs are often dismissed as immaturity which the girls will later outgrow. Since this assumption often proves true by Kindergarten, girls tend not to be diagnosed due to hyperactivity or disruptive classroom behavior.

If the world of social media seems daunting, it might help to think back to when you were growing up yourself.
Remember how you loved chatting to your friends on the bus and at break-time? Or the hours when you’d hog your family’s one phone (probably in the hallway) and keep your voice low in the hope that your secrets weren’t overheard?
How about when you’d buy new clothes – and spend hours trying them on in front of the mirror in your room, practising different ‘looks’? And how important it was, when your friends saw your new outfit, that they’d think it was ‘cool’?
Girls, no matter what generation, love to spend time with their girlfriends, sharing secrets and talking about fashions and heartthrobs.
One benefit of social media is its capacity to amplify a young person’s ability to share, care and compare.

Anyway, I went to the clinic yesterday and after some tests the nurse told me I have an STI. She said I MUST take all the pills because, if I don’t, I may end up not being able to have children.
Now, that really scares me! I want to have lots of kids when I’m older and have found the right guy. I’d die if I found out I could never get pregnant.
Auntie, is it true? Do you think I may never have kids? Please tell me.

The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) with their event, Invent it. Build it. aims to engage middle school girls and their parents through a hands on experience with actual scientists, engineers and more. “The event started as a partnership between the ExxonMobil Foundation, SWE and The Girl Scouts of the USA. We all put our heads together and decided that this event would be an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the girls. Since year one, we have expanded the event to include a Parent and Educator Program (PEP) as well as an EXPO that is open to the public as well as the participants,” said Randy Freedman, Outreach Manager for SWE.
According to Freedman, the event started with the idea “that having middle school girls do hands on engineering activities with female role models would have a significant impact on attitudes about engineering.” This hypothesis has proved true and Invent it. Build it. is now an annual event that takes place at the Society of Women Engineers Conference. “Hosting this event at the Society of Women Engineers annual conference allows us to introduce these girls to engineers from around the world.

Not because they can’t, but because it would have never occurred to them they couldn’t.” I agree. But what should we tell girls? Our national message to girls lately has been that they can be anything—especially if that anything is a career in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM). I’ve brought that message to our house: My kids have all participated in the Hour of Code, an international program to promote computer sciences. When my daughter expressed an interest in meteorology, we bought a bunch of books and documentaries about weather.
Now, a 2015 paper, “Gender Differences in Gifted Children,” indicates Silverman might be right, and offers suggestions on what we should be telling our girls instead.
Even when boys and girls both test well, girls have a lower self-concept than boys in STEM subjects.
It’s important that we make sure girls learn to play with boys in elementary school and that they don’t learn how to defer their intellect and competency to those same boys once they’re in middle and high school. As a business leader, your team and your competition will include men and women. Confidence in one’s intellect and competency are prerequisites to success.

A character will stay in an outfit until you change it yourself. So if you have a character change into an outfit, then they will be in the same outfit for the next scene and even the next episodes after that until you change it to a different outfit.
Recently people have been having trouble with that looping background. It doesn’t seem to work anymore so I suggest submitting a ticket about the issue.
Gain names cannot contain spaces. They should only have letters, numbers, and/or underscores, so you would need to change “gain Slightly Formal” to “gain Slightly_Formal” and then fix any other gain names that have spaces.
Layers are what puts characters and overlays in front or behind another character or overlay. So if you have BOY at layer 1 and GIRL at layer 2, then GIRL will be in front of BOY (the higher the layer number the more in front they are).

All this to say, I’ve known this idea for many, many of my writing years, and still, when I wasn’t paying attention, I was struggling with a character that didn’t want anything.
So, I’m currently working on draft 2.5 of a novel, and in all three versions-- while other elements of the plot and characters shifted and shaped in more sensible things -- one character of my ensemble cast continuously gave me trouble. I couldn’t justify why she was exactly where she was (recently joined a secret organization). She ping-ponged along in the story, hitting plot points by contrivance, coincidence, and other people’s doing, never making a significant decisions herself (well, later in the story) just sort of reacting to things.
So, I wrote and shedded multiple variations of backstories, brainstorming a dozen more, trying to give her a generic, hero motivating detail.
Ultimately, my resolution came from not looking backward, but looking forward. This novel is intended to be the first in a series, so I started theorizing forward, what’s coming next, what plot pieces are upcoming, what are the major themes I’m building up to explore and… kazam, there it was, a way that only gave me a character motivation/want and backstory, but also a way to integrate this character into the story in a way where she was just a sideline player before.

Have you ever thought about how much of your day revolves around looking at a screen? This would be including your computer, iPad or tablet, phone and TV. They are everywhere we look – schools, shops, gas stations, airports, libraries and restaurants.
The debate about screen use for kids (and ourselves) has been raging for years and it often gets heated and polarized. Many feel it has significantly improved education and entertainment and that it is the new normal so they do not want to question the status quo.
It was found that after just 30 minutes of screen time a day, children’s grades began a steady drop. After 4 hours/day, a student’s average GPA fell an entire grade.
More time on devices led to increased social and emotional volatility and disconnectedness from family.
It takes an average of 20 minutes longer to fall asleep when children have more screen time.
As screen time increased, a child’s focus decreased and grit (ability to perform a strenuous or difficult task without giving up) decreased.
—– And all of these effects where present when the kids were consuming 4 hours or less a day of screen time (which is half the national average at 8 hours per day!).

While we will know soon enough if the long wait for World Series glory for the Cubs will finally end this year, one thing is certain — Bleacher Bums is back. And just as this season has thus far been ground-breaking in many ways for the Cubs, the new production of Bleacher Bums promises to be a bit different as well.
The play, originally written collaboratively in 1977 by members of the Organic Theatre Company, from an idea by actor Joe Mantegna, was an instant classic. Now almost 40 years later, Bleacher Bums has been staged countless times around the world and was also turned into a television movie in 2002.
It tells the story of a group of Cub fans in the bleachers at a game against the visiting rival St. Louis Cardinals. They bet each other, talk about life, tease each other and persevere as Cub fans. Although it was updated in 1998 by the writers from the Organic to reflect the 1997 season, much of the play has stayed the same.

So, I’m currently working on draft 2.5 of a novel, and in all three versions-- while other elements of the plot and characters shifted and shaped in more sensible things -- one character of my ensemble cast continuously gave me trouble.

Have you ever thought about how much of your day revolves around looking at a screen? This would be including your computer, iPad or tablet, phone and TV. They are everywhere we look – schools, shops, gas stations, airports, libraries and restaurants.
The debate about screen use for kids (and ourselves) has been raging for years and it often gets heated and polarized. Many feel it has significantly improved education and entertainment and that it is the new normal so they do not want to question the status quo.
It was found that after just 30 minutes of screen time a day, children’s grades began a steady drop. After 4 hours/day, a student’s average GPA fell an entire grade.
More time on devices led to increased social and emotional volatility and disconnectedness from family.
It takes an average of 20 minutes longer to fall asleep when children have more screen time.
As screen time increased, a child’s focus decreased and grit (ability to perform a strenuous or difficult task without giving up) decreased.

They were done in a free program called GIMP, and they're a little horrendous. Appropriately, I pulled them together on my partner's computer, and I type this through paint.

The play Bleacher Bums is as synonymous with the Chicago Cubs as the ivy at Wrigley Field, the rooftops across from the ballpark on Sheffield and Waveland Avenues and waiting until next year. While we will know soon enough if the long wait for World Series glory for the Cubs will finally end this year, one thing is certain — Bleacher Bums is back. And just as this season has thus far been ground-breaking in many ways for the Cubs, the new production of Bleacher Bums promises to be a bit different as well.
The play, originally written collaboratively in 1977 by members of the Organic Theatre Company, from an idea by actor Joe Mantegna, was an instant classic. Now almost 40 years later, Bleacher Bums has been staged countless times around the world and was also turned into a television movie in 2002.
It tells the story of a group of Cub fans in the bleachers at a game against the visiting rival St. Louis Cardinals. They bet each other, talk about life, tease each other and persevere as Cub fans. Although it was updated in 1998 by the writers from the Organic to reflect the 1997 season, much of the play has stayed the same.
On Thursday, previews begin for the latest depiction, this time being done by Open Space Productions and staged a few Kris Bryant home run lengths from Wrigley Field at The Broadway Theater of the Pride Arts Center, 4139 N. Broadway Ave.

Frankly, I don't remember why I said that — probably because I was in love with computer games, especially Wolfenstein 3D. Anyway, I was right. I started programming when I was 10 by copying random snippets of C++ code from PC games magazine called 'CD–ACTION'. The first–ever thing I downloaded from the Internet was Pascal compiler (which, by the way, I didn't know how to use — cmd.exe was black magic at that time). That's basically how this exciting journey as a programmer started.
During my teenage angst, instead of drinking alcohol or smoking funny things, I got into hacking and computer security. Balancing on the edge of crime was exciting, however destroying things turned out to be much less enjoyable than creating. That's why at the beginning of high school I completely dropped hacking and started freelancing (in C# .NET) for real money. From that moment my career really took off — algorithm competitions, B.S. & M.S. at Warsaw University of Technology, first open source contributions, first local user groups, new technologies and more freelancing and consulting.
Fast forward to today, I'm co–founder and managing partner at Iterators — a software consulting company. Programming is still one of my favourite activities, so while I'm not counting money in Excel or answering very important emails, I'm sitting in front of my text editor writing code, learning new technologies or attending tech events.

Yup, they're marketed to men, but these two drugstore gems work wonders for ladies who want smooth, silky legs (or underarms, etc.). Gillette Shaving Cream has a rich, creamy lather that spreads easily and rinses clean for a close, comfortable shave. At under $2, it's also cheaper than most women's shaving creams/gels/lotions.
As for the Mach3, I couldn't live without this thing. I've had mine since college (not soo long ago, but long enough). I've tried it all - disposables, Nair, Venus, Sensor - and nothing gives you a better shave, sans nicks or irritation. The blades stay sharp for a ridiculously long time, and when they lose their edge, you simply swap them out (another money saver in the long run!).

Shaving creams contain ingredients like vitamin E, which helps to soften and hydrate hair for a closer shave.
Exfoliate regularly before you shave. This is the only way to remove dry and dead skin cells, giving you a smooth shave and helping your moisturisers absorb more easily.

I think most people expect me to go on a feminist rant about beauty standards and how it is unfair that women are expected to shave their legs but men aren’t. I think some people expect me to lift my arms and have a fur ball peeking out of my shirt. I think most are disappointed when they realise I don’t.

Some people recommend only using electric razors for shaving your pubic hair region but to get that waxing-look-alike shave, you have to use a blade.
Let’s talk about the necessary shaving equipment needed for male and female pubic hair shaving.
2. Shave Cream – make sure you use an expensive shave cream, preferably a men’s luxury shave cream like TwinLuxe’s Smooth Shave Cream….and yes for women too. Why? It’s because luxury men’s shave creams tend to be slicker, smoother spreading, and more moisturizing on your skin. Plus they tend not to melt off your skin when you are in a humid environment like a shower. Using soap or cheap shave creams will dry out your skin and exacerbate redness and unwanted razor bump formations which you definitely do not want down there!
How many times have you use a cheap shaving gel in the shower to shave your legs or beard and you are raced for time to complete your shave before the gel evaporates or disappears on its own? Well for pubic hair shaving, you need to take your time down there and you must use a shave cream that can hold its on – meaning it will stay on and protect your skin and not melt away.

Skin Deep - Shave The Day!
So in this weeks 'Skin Deep' post, I want to talk about shaving, because up until recently I really couldn't find something that worked the way I wanted it to for me. I have always shaved my legs and underarms as I find waxing a bit too pricey and I can't find many places close to where I live to get it done. Since we have had decent weather in the last week, I think it's time I get my pale lumpy legs out from their usual legging cocoon.
I use a regular 3-4 blade women's razor for my legs and underarms, but often when I buy shaving cream, I either find it too thick or too thin, or that I go through it really quick. I generally try and avoid aerosol because I find that they empty quick and then get binned, so I would rather stick with something a little more environmentally friendly and long lasting.
A few months ago I started using soap instead or shaving cream, but I found that too thin, and it wasn't until I went away forgetting my shaving cream that I used my solid shampoo instead. It has been the best thing to happen to my shaving routine ever! One of my favourite shampoos is Trichomania from Lush, which is a solid coconut oil based shampoo.

Smooth legs also make it more comfortable to wear hose or tight pants. As a result of this penchant for smooth legs, plenty of “hacks” have developed around the process. While some women choose to opt for waxing, most of us still stick with the a trusty razor and shaving foam to get the job done. However, some women prefer to use all natural shaving creme alternatives. For my own curiosity, I decided to do a little experiment to see what options are the best. Here are the results from 3 things I tried.
We use shaving cream or foam to provide some slip, meaning the razor can skim over the skin rather than dragging and causing a rash. Olive oil is, of course, very slippery – so what could possibly go wrong?
The Results: Olive oil is slippery – too slippery. It’s almost impossible to guide the razor in a straight line, meaning that within seconds it moves side to side. Sideways motion is pretty much the worst thing that can happen while a razor blade is on your skin. Cuts are inevitable with this lack of control.
Verdict: Keep the olive oil for salads; it’s got no place near your legs, at least, not while shaving!
Honey is medicinal and can work wonders on skin problems. Some women even incorporate it into homemade shampoos and skin products. So how does it fare when it

She's started noting the growth of hair on her legs, and while she hasn't outright asked for it yet (right now the big push is for pierced ears), I can tell the conversation is coming.

Retrieved Text: The 1950s were a time of increasing prosperity for Americans – and for baby boomers. Parents had some discretionary income to go out to restaurants for dinner with the whole family. The grown-ups would have their cocktails, and the children would have non-alcoholic mocktails. One of the most popular kiddie cocktail was the Shirley Temple (especially for girls) and the Roy Rogers (especially for boys).
Stories about the precise history of the Shirley Temple drink vary, as do the ingredients. However, the reason for the concoction was that the child star was taken out to fancy restaurants and events, where the adults were drinking, and she was given a beverage to match (minus the liquor). Some say that the Shirley Temple was invented in the 1930s at Chasen’s restaurant in Hollywood. Others claim that it was invented at the Brown Derby or The Royal Hawaiian Hotel.
There are also different versions of the drink. The small amount of grenadine and the maraschino cherry garnish seem to be constants, but the soda can be ginger ale, a lemon-lime soda, or a mixture of the two. Some add orange juice.
Shirley Temple was never really a fan of the drink, finding it “too sweet.” But she did protect her brand. When there was to be a bottled soda with the name “Shirley Temple” in 1988, she sued and won claiming that it was an invasion of her privacy because her name was not a generic term.
The Roy Rogers mocktail was named after the “King of the Cowboys” and was created in

The one-of-a-kind Coca-Cola 750-ml returnable glass bottle, developed specifically for the Bulgarian market, was named "best innovation" in the beverages category of the country's first-ever Product of the Year awards.
The bottle launched in 2016 to celebrate Coca-Cola’s 130th anniversary, but with a modern twist dedicated to the iconic glass bottle. The innovative package was designed to encourage people to pick one up on their way home from work to share with family and friends.
With Bulgarian households getting smaller – 60 percent now comprise only one or two members – shopping habits are changing. More people are picking up essentials on their way home instead of doing a big weekly shop.
To tempt shoppers to include a bottle of Coca-Cola in their shopping baskets, Coca-Cola Bulgaria developed the new 750-ml glass bottle as the perfect pack to take home.
The "returnability" of the 750-ml bottle also boosted its popularity and was a key aspect of the consumer promotion. In the end, the new bottle became so popular in Bulgaria that the company invested 2.5 million euros to build an assembly line to produce this larger version of the iconic contour bottle, which is still the only of its kind for Coca-Cola, anywhere in the world.

Kids LOVE winning a 2 Liter Bottle of Soda!
2 liter bottles of cola and sodas - typically used as the top prize - different flavors and colors (Donated from local grocery stores).
Set up large grouping of individual glass sodas 2 - 4 dozen or more - in the middle of the carnival booth or on a table.
You will want to have a few different "stand behind" lines for different aged players. Your youngest players should be about 1 yardstick away from the bottles.
This traditional carnival game is really a game of luck - it is difficult to place a ring directly on a soda bottle, so generally they bounce around the bottles and the player is lucky if they ring a bottle!
One more great reason to choose this game aside from ease in setup is that it almost advertises itself! When the hard plastic rings bounce off the bottles, it make a clanking sound, and seems to add to the festive atmosphere of any event!
Carnival players are given five rings to try their hand "ringing" one of the individual glass sodas. If they ring a soda, they get to keep a two liter bottle soda as their carnival prize. If they loop more than one, they can choose which one they keep - but they can only keep ONE. If players do not "ring" a bottle, they receive a consolation prize.

An unreliable narrator can't just be somebody who is telling the story from his own perspective, it has to be somebody who is purposely and intentionally manipulating the "facts," or who is perhaps acting as or writing as an omniscient narrator when he has no true omniscience. Of course, how one would determine what a fact even is is an entire new can of worms.
I guess, I'm wondering if any narrator from at least 20th-century fiction and beyond can be categorized as even a "reliable" narrator.
Also, it seems that the Greeks were concerned with the reliability of their narratives, as they had to legitimate their storytelling through invocation to the muse.
Agreed. The "unreliable narrator" mem has always seemed smug and shallow to me. No one is reliable all the time, and because someone is unreliable in some particular matter does not disqualify her testimony in other matters. The claim about an unreliable narrator always seemed to falsely reduce the problem of the reader's relationship to what she is reading, rather than illuminate it.
What is of interest is the relationship between the narrator's desires vis-a-vis the reader, and the relationship of those desires to what is narrated. To the extent that there is unreliability, it can spring from such a variety of motives and take such a multitude of forms that it is effectively meaningless as a classification, at

The narrator can take different positions or perspectives, from which he allows us to take a look at the world of figures of history: the narrative perspective. We distinguish between four narrative perspectives: the auctorial, the personal, the neutral and the narrator. To the latter perspective, the I-narrator, it is now to go.
An ego narrator describes the story from the I-perspective and thus uses the I-form. The story is thus told from the perspective of a single figure, which is why the reader can only perceive what it feels and sees or experiences in exchange with others. Let’s look at an example.
I did not sleep well. The whole night raged a storm, it crashed all the time and I almost fell out of bed. When it was finally resting again-it was probably already bright-Shiva, my cat lady, decided that the night was over. I dared try to ignore them, but I did not succeed, and in the end she got me prematurely and dog-eared out of bed.
In the above example, we have highlighted the signal words that characterize an I-narrator. For example, words like me, me, or even mine, when they are used not only in conversation with another figure, clearly refer to a narrative behavior from the ego perspective.
In this case, as a reader, we only know what the narrator tells us. Everything else remains closed to us, and the voice can not give us any background information

I grew up in a small town in Arkansas (Fordyce) and I often found going there and visiting my family to be dislocating. I felt more at home with my friends and my new interests. This was liberating in many ways—I’d always felt like an odd duck, growing up—but I also felt a sense of loss. I loved my family and I loved my hometown.

The use of nautical language, like "tacked and veered" and "keel," is used to suggest that the narrator is ____________.
This question starts with the assertion that the author uses nautical language in the text, and that the use of this kind of diction and jargon gives us an implication about the narrator. It is important to note here that this assertion is a given in answering this question and should be trusted as an accurate analytic statement about the text.
So, what is a reasonable inference to take from the use of seafaring jargon? Firstly, it is not medical jargon, so it's not reasonable to assume from the use of nautical language that the narrator is specifically a ship's doctor. Similarly, the use of nautical language is not in any way an indicator, and certainly not a direct indicator, that our narrator is speaking from the grave.
So, the last question we have to settle is whether or not the use of nautical language specifically tells us that the narrator is the not merely a sailor but the ship's captain as well. The use of nautical terms is not this specific, however, it signals that the narrator is a sailor, not in a position of authority.

What does this line mean to you? Did you feel present? Empowered? Fearful? Some sort of emotional reaction would seem likely given the gravity of these words. But, intriguingly, it might not be the most obvious words in this sentence that drive your emotional reaction. Reading something like “overcome” or “greatest weaknesses” can certainly prompt strong feelings but this might be particularly the case thanks to the personal pronoun “you.” Based on fascinating research by Tad Brunyé and colleagues, It seems that reading something in the second person (using “you” as the pronoun) can elicit stronger reactions compared to reading an identical text using the first-person (i.e. “I”) (Brunyé et al., 2011).
When we read a story, we don’t simply come to understand the information contained within the piece. Reading a story also involves imagining the events described and implied.

Retrieved Text: Because of its complicated origin, Beowulf has elements of both pagan Germanic culture and Christianity. The story of Beowulf probably originated as an oral tradition sometime in the 7th century. But the only surviving manuscript of Beowulf was written in the 11th century by Christian scribes, who either inserted the Christian overtones to the story, or were working from a manuscript set down by previous Christians who added the Christian elements. Suffice it to say that the resulting Beowulf is like a pagan story wrapped in Christianity. This results in some strange inconsistencies. For instance, the narrator of the poem describes Hrothgar at one point as a pagan who does not know of the true God, and yet all the characters, including Hrothgar, constantly thank God for their good fortune. In addition, the pagan concept of fate becomes rather hopelessly confused with God's will, so that sometimes Beowulf (and the narrator) seems to believe he can affect fate through his courage, while at others either Beowulf or the narrator attributes his success solely to God's favor. As you read Beowulf, keep on the lookout for the ways that Christianity and paganism interact in the poem.

The dispassionate chronicler is never shocked or sentimental, yet he retains a sensibility that might well qualify as wise and compassionate. This is the modern condition. Unless you’ve been living on an iceberg for the last 50 years, very little will surprise. And yet storytelling still demands a narrator. I’ve been reading Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s memoir, Wind, Sand and Stars, which is a lovely but highly narrated book. First published in 1939, Saint-Exupery could get away with a more heavy-handed narrative style. But the contemporary reader is less willing to trust the author these days. So the all-knowing, omniscient narrator might well be a thing of the past, like Saint-Exupery’s open cockpit bi-planes. But the post-modern trend toward killing the author (and by extension, the narrative voice) often makes for a jumpy, cinematic effect. Sebald’s dispassionate chronicler might be something to ponder as a narrative device.
The lively language of specialized labor often makes for wonderful reading.

A letter, postmarked Staten Island, is presumably addressed to the title character, Rouenna Zycinski, a combat nurse who has never gotten over Vietnam.
Readers should be warned, however, not to expect a novel about the war or they will be disappointed. Instead, For Rouenna is about another woman entirely: a novelist in Brooklyn who has just been dumped by her boyfriend. Wallowing in self pity and unable to start her new work, this unnamed narrator strikes up an uneasy friendship with Rouenna, who, years ago, lived in the same housing project. Convinced that Rouenna is as mercenary as herself, Nunez's narrator keeps her at a distance until the retired nurse's suicide provides inspiration for her novel.
What this means is that this book is not "for Rouenna" at all. It is not about a nurse in Vietnam. Instead, For Rouenna is about what Nunez's Brooklyn narrator cannot move beyond: her failings, her fantasies, her false memories, her childhood trauma.

Review: What first caught my attention about The Father, was the fact that it is based on a true story. In the early 90s, three brothers committed ten extremely violent robberies in only a few months. This is their story, told by their own brother. Anton Svensson is actually the pseudonym for the two authors who co-wrote this story, one of them is Stefan Thunberg, the fourth brother.

I found the "then" parts highly interesting. Their family seemed to work but with each day the father went a bit further, teaching his son to fight, to defend himself from the bullies. Becoming more and more violent. Ignoring his wife and transforming his eldest into a machine. From those parts you could clearly see why and how those children had become criminals.

An unreliable narrator can't just be somebody who is telling the story from his own perspective, it has to be somebody who is purposely and intentionally manipulating the "facts," or who is perhaps acting as or writing as an omniscient narrator when he has no true omniscience. Of course, how one would determine what a fact even is is an entire new can of worms.
I guess, I'm wondering if any narrator from at least 20th-century fiction and beyond can be categorized as even a "reliable" narrator.
Also, it seems that the Greeks were concerned with the reliability of their narratives, as they had to legitimate their storytelling through invocation to the muse.
Agreed. The "unreliable narrator" mem has always seemed smug and shallow to me. No one is reliable all the time, and because someone is unreliable in some particular matter does not disqualify her testimony in other matters. The claim about an unreliable narrator always seemed to falsely reduce the problem of the reader's relationship to what she is reading, rather than illuminate it.
What is of interest is the relationship between the narrator's desires vis-a-vis the reader, and the relationship of those desires to what is narrated. To the extent that there is unreliability, it can spring from such a variety of motives and take such a multitude of forms that it is effectively meaningless as a classification, at

Retrieved Text: A narrator encounters us in epic texts. He is the voice or the speaker of the work. The narrator can take different positions or perspectives, from which he allows us to take a look at the world of figures of history: the narrative perspective. We distinguish between four narrative perspectives: the auctorial, the personal, the neutral and the narrator. To the latter perspective, the I-narrator, it is now to go.
An ego narrator describes the story from the I-perspective and thus uses the I-form. The story is thus told from the perspective of a single figure, which is why the reader can only perceive what it feels and sees or experiences in exchange with others. Let’s look at an example.
I did not sleep well. The whole night raged a storm, it crashed all the time and I almost fell out of bed. When it was finally resting again-it was probably already bright-Shiva, my cat lady, decided that the night was over. I dared try to ignore them, but I did not succeed, and in the end she got me prematurely and dog-eared out of bed.
In the above example, we have highlighted the signal words that characterize an I-narrator. For example, words like me, me, or even mine, when they are used not only in conversation with another figure, clearly refer to a narrative behavior from the ego perspective.
In this case, as a reader, we only know what the narrator tells us. Everything else remains closed to us, and the voice can not give us any background information

I grew up in a small town in Arkansas (Fordyce) and I often found going there and visiting my family to be dislocating. I felt more at home with my friends and my new interests. This was liberating in many ways—I’d always felt like an odd duck, growing up—but I also felt a sense of loss. I loved my family and I loved my hometown.

The use of nautical language, like "tacked and veered" and "keel," is used to suggest that the narrator is ____________.
This question starts with the assertion that the author uses nautical language in the text, and that the use of this kind of diction and jargon gives us an implication about the narrator. It is important to note here that this assertion is a given in answering this question and should be trusted as an accurate analytic statement about the text.
So, what is a reasonable inference to take from the use of seafaring jargon? Firstly, it is not medical jargon, so it's not reasonable to assume from the use of nautical language that the narrator is specifically a ship's doctor. Similarly, the use of nautical language is not in any way an indicator, and certainly not a direct indicator, that our narrator is speaking from the grave.
So, the last question we have to settle is whether or not the use of nautical language specifically tells us that the narrator is the not merely a sailor but the ship's captain as well. The use of nautical terms is not this specific, however, it signals that the narrator is a sailor, not in a position of authority.

But, intriguingly, it might not be the most obvious words in this sentence that drive your emotional reaction. Reading something like “overcome” or “greatest weaknesses” can certainly prompt strong feelings but this might be particularly the case thanks to the personal pronoun “you.” Based on fascinating research by Tad Brunyé and colleagues, It seems that reading something in the second person (using “you” as the pronoun) can elicit stronger reactions compared to reading an identical text using the first-person (i.e. “I”) (Brunyé et al., 2011).

The story of Beowulf probably originated as an oral tradition sometime in the 7th century. But the only surviving manuscript of Beowulf was written in the 11th century by Christian scribes, who either inserted the Christian overtones to the story, or were working from a manuscript set down by previous Christians who added the Christian elements. Suffice it to say that the resulting Beowulf is like a pagan story wrapped in Christianity. This results in some strange inconsistencies. For instance, the narrator of the poem describes Hrothgar at one point as a pagan who does not know of the true God, and yet all the characters, including Hrothgar, constantly thank God for their good fortune. In addition, the pagan concept of fate becomes rather hopelessly confused with God's will, so that sometimes Beowulf (and the narrator) seems to believe he can affect fate through his courage, while at others either Beowulf or the narrator attributes his success solely to God's favor. As you read Beowulf, keep on the lookout for the ways that Christianity and paganism interact in the poem.

The dispassionate chronicler is never shocked or sentimental, yet he retains a sensibility that might well qualify as wise and compassionate. This is the modern condition. Unless you’ve been living on an iceberg for the last 50 years, very little will surprise. And yet storytelling still demands a narrator. I’ve been reading Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s memoir, Wind, Sand and Stars, which is a lovely but highly narrated book. First published in 1939, Saint-Exupery could get away with a more heavy-handed narrative style. But the contemporary reader is less willing to trust the author these days. So the all-knowing, omniscient narrator might well be a thing of the past, like Saint-Exupery’s open cockpit bi-planes. But the post-modern trend toward killing the author (and by extension, the narrative voice) often makes for a jumpy, cinematic effect.

Retrieved Text: Christina Rossetti’s poem “A Pause of Thought” explores the hope of the narrator that an unrequited love might return one day. Assuming the narrator is a woman, she takes us on an emotional journey of love and heartache. In the first stanza, she is expressing the heartbreak one has when the love they give to another person is not reciprocated. In the second line she says, “And hope deferred made my heart sick…” which is an example of personification (32). The narrator gives the heart, an inanimate object, a human characteristic and places it with the word ‘sick’ to emphasize the pain and discomfort she is going through. Next, in the second stanza she describes that her faith has not died, and she has hope that one day her love will come back. The narrator says in the eighth line how she “watched and waited,” and the repetition in the words allows the reader to relate to the repetitive action of longing for a love one to return (32). Following, in the third stanza the narrator is starting to give up on love, she states in lines ten and eleven, “My expectation wearies and shall cease; I will resign it now and be at peace” (32). No matter male or female, the pain of loving someone and waiting for them to love you back becomes exhausting. In the fourth stanza, the narrator fantasizes about what it would like to be married and be loved by the person she loves, but is beginning to come to understand

The narrator of the book experienced a constant struggle with visibility and his own identity, something even modern readers could relate to.
In the “The Art of Fiction: An Interview” with Ralph Ellison, he explains regarding his narrator: “The major flaw in the hero’s character is his unquestioning willingness to do what is required of him by others as a way to success, and this was the specific form of his ‘innocence.’ He goes where he is told to go; he does what he is told to do he does not even choose his Brotherhood name” (178). The narrator was “invisible” for most of the book because he was playing the role in which he believed he was meant to play. He had the leadership quality within him, but it could not be expressed to his full potential because he was holding himself back. The fact that he doesn’t even get to choose his new name reflects his invisibility and ability to be manipulated by others. He was only seen as a tool to the Brotherhood, and when he realizes “All boundaries down, freedom was not only the recognition of necessity, it was the recognition of possibility” (499), he realizes that he has been invisible and his identity has been hidden.

As with all of Portis' fiction, the tone is cool, sympathetic, funny, and undeniably American.
While not for all tastes, "Norwood" is Charles Portis' first novel and one that displays the author's fondness for wry observational humor and quirky characters. Norwood Pratt accepts a job to drive a car cross-country for a shady businessman, all in the hopes of collecting $70 from a friend in New York City. The real joy of this tale lies in watching Norwood's interactions with the strange, colorful people that he meets along the way, and how the hero's unwavering simple worldview gets him into and out of trouble.

An epic crime novel with the excitement of Jo Nesbo'sHeadhunters and the narrative depth of We Need to Talk About Kevin, The Father is inspired by the extraordinary true story of three brothers who committed ten audacious bank robberies in Sweden over the course of just two years.
Review: What first caught my attention about The Father, was the fact that it is based on a true story. In the early 90s, three brothers committed ten extremely violent robberies in only a few months. This is their story, told by their own brother. Anton Svensson is actually the pseudonym for the two authors who co-wrote this story, one of them is Stefan Thunberg, the fourth brother.
The book focuses on two periods of time: then, when the brothers where young (the eldest was 12 and the youngest 3), and now, when the brothers have decided to rob their first target (the eldest is 24 and the youngest 17). I found the "then" parts highly interesting. Their family seemed to work but with each day the father went a bit further, teaching his son to fight, to defend himself from the bullies. Becoming more and more violent. Ignoring his wife and transforming his eldest into a machine. From those parts you could clearly see why and how those children had become criminals.

My grandparents lived in an old house in Canton, Ohio with a front porch. I can remember as a boy sitting out there and watching the neighbors interact…watching the “social media” of the day in full action. My grandfather used to take me on a 3-4 minute walk up Second Street to the general store that also had a front porch that was occupied by people connecting, sharing life, and sharing experiences.

For instance, a house with a neat, clean front lawn likely has greater curb appeal than a residence surrounded by an overgrown front lawn, and for good reason. As a home seller, you want your residence to sell as quickly as possible. And in order to accomplish this goal, you&apos;ll need to spend some time boosting your house&apos;s curb appeal to make your residence attractive to prospective homebuyers. Fortunately, there are many quick, simple ways to boost your home&apos;s curb appeal, including: 1. Focus on the Roof Is your roof missing shingles? If so, you&apos;ll want to repair or replace defective shingles immediately, because failure to do so may lead homebuyers to consider alternatives. Also, don&apos;t forget to clean your roof if its shingles look dreary and streaked, as this can help you enhance your home&apos;s curb appeal instantly. 2. Spruce Up the Front Porch Setting up a few plants on your front porch can help give your home a warm, inviting feel. Thus, when homebuyers pass by, plants may help draw attention to your house over others. Typically, colorful flowers are great for a front porch.

The moment you see a porch, you may imagine sitting on a porch swing or drinking your morning coffee while chatting with your neighbors. Many of us love porches, and many of us would admit to being significantly swayed towards a property that has one. The trouble is, once we’re inside those homes, we fail to realize what we’ve got. That’s because, despite what they’d have us believe on the big screen, porches often go unused. If you aren’t careful, they’ll become a neglected home feature which you barely even notice.
That can be heartbreaking, especially if the porch was the reason you bought that property in the first place. The trouble is that porches go clean out of our minds once we’re inside our homes. While we focus on things like decor and interior renovation, we often fail to consider exteriors. And we fail to consider our porches right along with them. When that happens, there won’t be a porch swing. You’ll never drink coffee as the sun comes up.

My friends and I would discuss the approaching baseball playoffs and the upcoming football season. We often talked of what the future might hold after we graduated.

Easily blamed on a bad paint job or old windows, you may never realize that sticking windows could be a sign of something much more severe.

Part of any porch’s construction is the inclusion of an overhang or roof. While a deck is exposed to the elements, a porch is typically a covered extension of the home, and therefore of the house’s roof.

This movie was initially shot along with Rock N' Roll Cops as one big experiment. And then the footage was set aside for several years. Then it was edited into two different movies. The initial idea was to do the film as one long shot, and that sensibility seems to extend into many of the scenes of this movie, which start too early and last too long. The overall effect is to dilute all the good parts, and intensify all the bad ones. How does that work? An amusing exchange of conversation set in the middle of a rambling dialogue in a restaurant is less interesting than if the conversation were edited down to just the humorous bits. But on the other hand, if a sequence is off-putting (the casual misogyny and sexual harassment) in a more tightly-controlled movie, the viewer is usually pretty certain that it's in there for a reason. In this movie, I suspect that sort of thing was just tossed off without any real thought. That's the point where the geode cracks open and your soul flies away. Urgh. Also, autofocus hated this film.

Hold the raglan or V neck with purl side facing you, knit side toward the machine. You will need to pick up approximately 3 stitches every 4 rows. This varies a little, depending on your yarn and gauge, so you may need a few more stitches, or a few less. Too many stitches causes the edge to buckle and bulge; too few causes it to pucker and draw in. It is a good idea to practice this first. If you still have the gauge swatch, pick up stitches along a side edge (not the cast on or bound off ends) to check spacing.

Wash jersey using a cool wash temperature, as long as the fabric is not heavily stained. Don’t over-fill the washing machine as this will cause more creases in your clothes and they won’t be cleaned as effectively. Turn embellished or patterned garments inside out and try to avoid mixing bright colours and whites in the wash, as the colours may bleed.
It is better not to use a tumble dryer as this can make the fabric shrink.
If possible, gently pull your garment into the correct shape and then dry it flat. Alternatively you can line-dry jersey – but make sure you keep it in its original shape as much as possible. Put t-shirts on clothes hangers and then hang them on the line: this will also help to remove creases.
Jersey fabric items should need very little or no ironing. If you do need to iron them, iron on the wrong side of the fabric using a medium heat setting and steam if necessary.
As jersey is a stretch fabric, it is best to use a stretch stitch with a matching thread to mend it. There is a method of embroidering called swiss darning, which looks like a knitted stitch.
You can also stitch up small holes, working across the hole on the back of the fabric using small stitches and a matching thread. Be careful not to pull your stitches too tightly, as this will make the fabric pucker.

Even cardigans--the knitter makes a Nowegian-style pullover and then the knitting is stitched with a machine to prevent unravelling. The sweater is then cut down the front to open the cardigan up. A band for buttons is added by knitting or sewing on a tightly knitted band, often embellished with woven braid. Icelandic sweaters are also done in the round, typically. Socks are the garments most often knit in the round; double-pointed needles, with their ability to hold a smaller circumference of stitches, are still typically used.
When knitting on circular needles or double points, the knitting is cast on and the circle of stitches is joined. Knitting is worked in rounds in a spiral.
1. Cast on stitches on THREE or FOUR needles. Three supports your knitting on a triangle, four makes a square "tube" as you work. The knitting will be round, however, when you are finished.
2. Divide the stitches equally over the needles and knit a round. To close the circle, knit the first stitch with the working yarn from the last stitch--and a nice trick is to use the tail of the cast on, and knit it with the first stitch. This pulls the knittng in tighter to avoid causing a gap. Keep the last and first needle as close together as possible. Make sure the knitted stitch is tight, by keeping it close to the last needle. This also avoids a gap, though any gap can

Question: Can you explain the actual reason why knit fabric consumption is calculated in kg and woven in yards? Is there any problem if we calculate woven consumption also in kg?
In the apparel and textile trade, fabric consumption for the knits fabric is calculated in grams and kilograms. On the other hand, the fabric consumption of the woven fabric is calculated in the liner length like meters or yards.
Now the question is why one type of fabrics (knits) are measured in Kgs and another type of fabrics (woven) are measured in meters/yards?
In this post, I will explain the reason.
Normally, woven fabrics are dimensionally stable. Woven fabrics don’t get stretched easily. So, the linear length of the woven fabric remains the same during the fabric handing and measurement. Also, the width of the woven fabric does not get changed. Therefore, when you purchase woven fabric of the desired length and specific width, you will get that. When you cut the fabric for your design, you would not get any issue like actual fabric length becomes shorter than the purchased one and fabric thickness changes (GSM) drastically too high or too low thickness.
On the other hand, knitted fabrics get stretched easily in length direction as well as in width direction. When the fabric is stretched lengthwise, the width of the knitted fabric gets reduced. In such circumstances, if you buy knits fabric in length and supplier may measure the knits fabric by stretching it. Later when

The earliest known surviving knitted Aran sweater dates from the 1920’s and is knitted in the style of a traditional ‘fishing shirt’ or ‘wedding shirt’. It has been noted by some people that these sweaters would have been too heavy for fishermen to wear, as once they were soaked through, the untreated wool would become very stiff and restrict movement.
Although the intricate patterns were originally handed down by word of mouth – jealously guarded in families (and Clans in Ireland) – the first commercially printed Aran patterns became available in the 1940’s and became increasingly popular in the 1950’s, as wool rationing was lifted. (Aran patterned sweaters use a lot more wool than a normal sweater, due to the number of travelling stitches, which necessitates more stitches on the needle per row).

I am very wary of making blankets that have squares to seam together at the end. I once made a mitered square blanket that, no joke, took me longer to seam together and weave in ends than it did to knit the squares. The only reason I saw 100’s through to the end was because most of the squares are picked up and knit, no seaming, so it wasn’t quite so bad.
But back to this one, the seaming was very simple, and the squares themselves are big enough that it was actually fun putting it together sort of like a puzzle. I will not make a blanket with tiny mitered squares again, but I wouldn’t mind doing a full size version of this one for our home.

Left Brain vs. Right Brain -- Which Side Are You On?
Glenn Day, a teacher in Indiana, submitted this week's lesson on the human brain.
Following a lecture and student discussion about the right and left hemispheres of the brain, students determine whether they are right-brain dominant or left-brain dominant -- and what that means.
Students learn that different regions of the brain are responsible for specific tasks and recognize that brain dominance helps determine personality and behavior.
The brain is divided into two hemispheres that utilize two different modes of thinking. In each individual, one side of the brain is more dominant than the other side.
Brain dominance affects how a person processes information (learns).
How a person learns affects personality and behavior.
Whether people are right-brain dominant or left-brain dominant, they possess characteristics of both hemispheres in their personalities and behavior.
Modern society and the educational system tend to discriminate against the right hemisphere and nonverbal forms of intellect.
What are the key characteristics of L-mode and R-mode sides of the brain?
What type of stimuli do typical right-brain people and left-brain people respond to, and how does that affect personality and behavior?
How can knowing whether he or she is more right-brain dominant or left-brain dominant help a person learn and live?
Students complete a short quiz in which they determine whether they are right- or left-brain dominant.

In addition, these birds are often considered to be capable of complex social reasoning. But the question remains if this behavior is as smart as it looks? In her investigation Elske van der Vaart used a new technique: Namely, that of computational cognitive modeling. This is an approach that is frequently used to study humans, but is rarely applied to other species.
It has been speculated that Western scrub jays, in particular, may possess a ‘theory of mind’, or the ability to reason about the mental states of others.
This view is the result of behavior that the birds display in the context of caching; when they hide food under the ground, saving it for later, they seem to flexibly respond to the threat of future theft. In particular, they tend to re-cache their items later if other birds saw where they were hidden, as if they can reason about what other birds can see.
Vander Vaart has built a kind of ‘virtual bird’, based on a number of basic assumptions about corvid memory and learning. Then this virtual bird is exposed to simulated versions of real experiments, in order to derive new explanations for why corvids re-cache the way they do. She concludes that in particular, it is shown that many experimental results can be explained in a cognitively less complex way than is currently done, and it is therefore too

But there is no doubt that there are certain kinds of behavior, economists call it herd behavior, but you see it in financial markets periodically. You see it in housing markets. There's no reason to explain why everybody thought that housing prices would just keep going up and up other than that they did believe it. And so there's no doubt that this sort of herding instinct occurs and affects things. But usually things like that come back to earth.

ScienceDaily (Feb. 10, 2012) — Authoritarian parents whose child-rearing style can be summed up as "it's my way or the highway" are more likely to raise disrespectful, delinquent children who do not see them as legitimate authority figures than authoritative parents who listen to their children and gain their respect and trust, according to new research from the University of New Hampshire.
"When children consider their parents to be legitimate authority figures, they trust the parent and feel they have an obligation to do what their parents tell them to do. This is an important attribute for any authority figure to possess, as the parent does not have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior, and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present," said Rick Trinkner, a doctoral candidate at UNH and the lead researcher.
This is the first study to look at whether parenting styles influence adolescents' beliefs about the legitimacy of parent authority and if those perceptions affect delinquent behavior. The results are presented in the February issue of the Journal of Adolescence in the article "Don't trust anyone over 30: Parental legitimacy as a mediator between parenting style and changes in delinquent behavior over time."

Instead, they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the organism. In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner, a strict behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring, consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.
As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953). In other words, we learn to behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences, and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences. Skinner disagreed with Freud’s idea that personality is fixed in childhood. He argued that personality develops over our entire life, not only in the first few years. Our responses can change as we come across new situations; therefore, we can expect more variability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate. For example, consider a young woman, Greta, a risk taker. She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang gliding and kiteboarding. But after she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and punishments in her environment changes. Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she no longer engages in those behaviors. In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person.

The answer is a simple yes – talking to the “average” consumer may work fine for assessing line extensions of well known product categories, but when you have disruptive, behavior-changing concepts – ones that often smash or reinvent product categories - then you are more likely putting disruptive ideas into a testing situation where the cards are automatically stacked against them.
Consumers’ in a research study tend to judge new ideas by relying on what they already know and use… and as researchers’ Mugge and Dahl reported in 2013, “If innovations are perceived to as difficult to understand and use, this may frustrate and overwhelm [the average] consumers. Radical innovations are very different than the product stored in memories… because they allow consumers to do things they were unable to do before…”. Simply put, the average consumer isn’t well-equipped to think about a radical transformation of their own behavior, so a rep-pop recruit will default to giving higher evaluations of the “easier to understand” ideas, while pushing the more radical opportunities to the side.

Well, those people are great examples of “nature smart” individuals. Naturalistic intelligence refers to a human being’s sensitivity to the natural world. This is the ability to distinguish among nature’s different features such as animals, plants, rock configurations, cloud formations, and other such things. In the past, the naturalist intelligence was undoubtedly of great value in a person’s survival. Farming and hunting were clearly among the activities that relied on this type of intelligence. Today, naturalistic intelligence remains a vital component of roles like being a chef or botanist. This type of intelligence is also seen in the way consumers discriminate among products.
While other people gravitate towards nature, there are also those who tend to be drawn to the musical arts. These “musical smart” people are usually more sensitive to sounds that most individuals aren’t aware of. The intelligence involved in this ability to recognize tone, rhythm, timbre, and pitch is musical intelligence. With this type of intelligence, people are able to detect, generate, reproduce, and contemplate music as clearly exhibited by attuned listeners, musicians, composers, vocalists, and conductors. You’ll find that young adults with musical intelligence are frequently drumming, singing, or any other activity that demonstrates a melodic inclination. It is also interesting to note that a connection has been shown to exist between emotions and music as well as mathematics and music.

Stress and I have had a long, complicated relationship. Early in my career, it often felt like my naturally lower-stress, quiet management style was an impediment to advancement.
But this isn’t about me — it’s about the lens we routinely use to view managerial talent. Over my decades in business I worked with and observed a similar dynamic time and time again: classic high-octane Type A’s (aggressive, impatient, with high stress levels) most often ended up with top leadership roles while classic lower-volume Type B’s (calm, patient, more laid back), who were nonetheless extremely capable, ended up in lesser positions. When it comes to talent assessment, it seems we tend to make decisions with blinders on, defaulting to an expected model of high-stress, high-intensity leadership.
There are two big problems with this. First, when unchecked Type A behavior creates a persistently stressful environment for the team, it’s a recipe for employee disengagement. Yes, there are Type A individuals who are among the most admirable people I’ve had the privilege to know: brilliant, boundless energy — keen judges of character who achieved off-the-charts performance. But we all also know high-intensity managers who can be counted on to deliver a tough project but leave a trail of bodies in their wake. Ultimately, that’s not an efficient long-term model. Ideally, employees will want to come back for more next week, and in the weeks and months after that.

We do not refer to any dynamism (such as the id or the superego) taking direct action or direct control of behavior. Instead we refer to several cognitive processes that are rapid and require minimal capacity. This principle was set forth by Donald Broadbent more than 35 years ago. He described the mind as a processing system with a limited capacity. That is, we can perceive only a small portion of what we sense, and we can consciously apprehend less than that. Just as we cannot be aware of all the external stimuli to which we are continually exposed, we cannot be simultaneously aware of all of our internal information.
The vast array of experiments utilizing priming methods and implicit learning methods demonstrate that we are not always at one with our mental data base. Priming experiments reveal that our memorial stores can become activated without our awareness (Scarborough et al., 1979; Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Jacobs & Nadel, 1985). Implicit learning and memory experiments have shown that humans can acquire complex information without any knowledge of having done so (Abrams & Reber, 1988; Reber, 1989). Other cognitive processes that are not always accessible to consciousness are attitudes, biases, schemata, and scripts that are quiescent and unconscious until activated. At that time they influence consciousness rapidly and indirectly, but they are not independent of will. With effort they can be ascertained and, if appropriate, disputed, and replaced with new attitudes, scripts and schemata.

Her analysis revealed that whereas doubling poor families' income would lift most children above the poverty line, it would have almost no effect on their test scores and only a slight effect on their social behavior. This might be explained by the fact that extra money is usually spent on things that have little to do with helping children succeed in school or life and by the fact that good parenting has a lot in common with being a good worker, therefore children with parents who possess the qualities of good workers tend to do well even if their parents do not earn a lot.

This study found that they were able to separate out people with the Combined type vs the Inattentive type of ADHD by using an Impulsive and Perserverance Behavior scale known as the UPPS. I have included a copy of the scale at the bottom of this post.
This behavioral test or scale was found to be very sensitive in discriminating people with Inattentive ADHD not only from people with Combined type ADHD but it could also tease out the individuals with Combined type ADHD with Oppositional Defiance Disorder and the people without ADHD. The authors concluded that the brain pathways for impulsive behavior, urgency, sensation seeking and perserverance may explain the symptoms of the different types of ADHD.
The most interesting part of this study was that this scale, unlike many others, could be used to differentiate kids with all types of ADHD from non-ADHD controls. Perseverance training is, I think, something that we, who have symptoms of Inattentive ADHD or who have children with Inattentive ADHD, need to work on if we are to improve the symptoms of ADHD-PI. Different tools and strategies that encourage perseverance such as ADHD behavior rewards and punishment are helpful in this regard.

In her investigation Elske van der Vaart used a new technique: Namely, that of computational cognitive modeling. This is an approach that is frequently used to study humans, but is rarely applied to other species.
It has been speculated that Western scrub jays, in particular, may possess a ‘theory of mind’, or the ability to reason about the mental states of others.
This view is the result of behavior that the birds display in the context of caching; when they hide food under the ground, saving it for later, they seem to flexibly respond to the threat of future theft. In particular, they tend to re-cache their items later if other birds saw where they were hidden, as if they can reason about what other birds can see.
Vander Vaart has built a kind of ‘virtual bird’, based on a number of basic assumptions about corvid memory and learning. Then this virtual bird is exposed to simulated versions of real experiments, in order to derive new explanations for why corvids re-cache the way they do. She concludes that in particular, it is shown that many experimental results can be explained in a cognitively less complex way than is currently done, and it is therefore too

"When children consider their parents to be legitimate authority figures, they trust the parent and feel they have an obligation to do what their parents tell them to do. This is an important attribute for any authority figure to possess, as the parent does not have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior, and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present," said Rick Trinkner, a doctoral candidate at UNH and the lead researcher.

Instead, they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the organism. In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner, a strict behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring, consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.
As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953). In other words, we learn to behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences, and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences. Skinner disagreed with Freud’s idea that personality is fixed in childhood. He argued that personality develops over our entire life, not only in the first few years. Our responses can change as we come across new situations; therefore, we can expect more variability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate. For example, consider a young woman, Greta, a risk taker. She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang gliding and kiteboarding. But after she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and punishments in her environment changes. Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she no longer engages in those behaviors. In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person.

The answer is a simple yes – talking to the “average” consumer may work fine for assessing line extensions of well known product categories, but when you have disruptive, behavior-changing concepts – ones that often smash or reinvent product categories - then you are more likely putting disruptive ideas into a testing situation where the cards are automatically stacked against them.
Consumers’ in a research study tend to judge new ideas by relying on what they already know and use… and as researchers’ Mugge and Dahl reported in 2013, “If innovations are perceived to as difficult to understand and use, this may frustrate and overwhelm [the average] consumers.

Every observant dog owner can see for himself that his dog gets greater satisfaction from the praise rewarding a well- executed command or good behavior than he does from the momentary excitement of disobeying, which is usually followed by the evident guilt feelings, (ears back and avoiding eye contact), even when he has not been punished.
Owners vary in their training talents just as dogs vary in their train ability. Some people are born animal trainers and accomplish remarkable results with little effort. But even the best trainers are seldom equally successful with every breed of dog. The training procedures that are highly successful with one type of dog may be totally ineffective with another.
A basic mental affinity, even a certain type of personality seems to be necessary when training a dog. All good trainers possess authority, patience, and self-control. Brilliant ones possess an additional indefinable “x” quality that is probably a combination of love and respect.
Dog training techniques have been so well systematized in recent years that the least gifted owner can achieve reasonable good results with effort, persistence, patience, and understanding. Dogs have a much higher understanding intelligence than most people give them credit for. They can and do learn, but we have to give them our time and patience.

DISC is a quadrant behavioral model based on the work of Dr. William Moulton Marston (1893–1947) to examine the behavior of individuals in their environment or within a specific situation (otherwise known as environment). It therefore focuses on the styles and preferences of such behavior.
Marston graduated from doctoral studies at Harvard in the newly developing field of psychology. He was also a consulting psychologist, researcher, and author or co-author of five books. His works were showcased in Emotions of Normal People in 1928 among others.
DISC proponents believe that characteristics of behavior can be grouped into these four major “behavior styles” and they tend to exhibit specific characteristics common to that particular style. All individuals possess all four, but what differs from one to another is the extent of each.
For most, these types are seen in shades of grey rather than black or white, and within that, there is an interplay of behaviors, otherwise known as blends. The determination of such blends starts with the primary (or stronger) type, followed by the secondary (or lesser) type, although all contribute more than just purely the strength

We all experience challenges or difficulty at one point or another in our lives- some more than others. But the one thing I have witnessed and know for sure is we do have the ability to influence our karma in a positive way.
For example, if you are the type of person who has difficulty saying ‘no’ and you tend to agree to things you really do not want to do or like to do, then you are creating a pattern of resentment in your life.
Alternatively, if you tend to look for the good in others and try to see the positive side of a situation- even a difficult situation, then you are creating a pattern of confidence and personal triumph in your life.
Observe how others express good patterns and bad patterns of behavior. When you recognize bad patterns it’s because you’ve already experienced that in this life or a past life. You have learned the karmic lesson already. Learn to observe others with a compassionate eye, as they are still learning their karmic lesson at their own pace. Observe without judgement, without attachment.

Dogs have a tendency to jump on furniture, whether it is the living room sofa or the kitchen chair. In order to stop your dog from furniture jumping, it is important to train him before the situation gets out of hand. Here are some tips.
Whether you are home or not, dogs genuinely want to be as close to their owners as possible. Thus, they tend to jump on the sofa and sit along side you; or when alone; they may jump on a piece of furniture nearest to the window; waiting for you to come home.
Stopping your dog from furniture jumping can be put to an end by using commands in which your dog will understand this behavior is no longer acceptable. Simply take the dog by his collar, and gently take him off the furniture. At the same time, firmly tell him “no,” and turn away. Repeat this method every time you catch him on your furniture. Once he understands what behavior is expected, he will stop.
As the dominant owner of your furry friend, the key to stop your dog from furniture jumping is to set rules.

But this isn’t about me — it’s about the lens we routinely use to view managerial talent. Over my decades in business I worked with and observed a similar dynamic time and time again: classic high-octane Type A’s (aggressive, impatient, with high stress levels) most often ended up with top leadership roles while classic lower-volume Type B’s (calm, patient, more laid back), who were nonetheless extremely capable, ended up in lesser positions. When it comes to talent assessment, it seems we tend to make decisions with blinders on, defaulting to an expected model of high-stress, high-intensity leadership.

We do not refer to any dynamism (such as the id or the superego) taking direct action or direct control of behavior. Instead we refer to several cognitive processes that are rapid and require minimal capacity. This principle was set forth by Donald Broadbent more than 35 years ago. He described the mind as a processing system with a limited capacity. That is, we can perceive only a small portion of what we sense, and we can consciously apprehend less than that. Just as we cannot be aware of all the external stimuli to which we are continually exposed, we cannot be simultaneously aware of all of our internal information.
The vast array of experiments utilizing priming methods and implicit learning methods demonstrate that we are not always at one with our mental data base. Priming experiments reveal that our memorial stores can become activated without our awareness (Scarborough et al., 1979; Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Jacobs & Nadel, 1985). Implicit learning and memory experiments have shown that humans can acquire complex information without any knowledge of having done so (Abrams & Reber, 1988; Reber, 1989). Other cognitive processes that are not always accessible to consciousness are attitudes, biases, schemata, and scripts that are quiescent and unconscious until activated. At that time they influence consciousness rapidly and indirectly, but they are not independent of will. With effort they can be ascertained and, if appropriate, disputed, and replaced with new attitudes, scripts and schemata.

Her analysis revealed that whereas doubling poor families' income would lift most children above the poverty line, it would have almost no effect on their test scores and only a slight effect on their social behavior. This might be explained by the fact that extra money is usually spent on things that have little to do with helping children succeed in school or life and by the fact that good parenting has a lot in common with being a good worker, therefore children with parents who possess the qualities of good workers tend to do well even if their parents do not earn a lot.

This behavioral test or scale was found to be very sensitive in discriminating people with Inattentive ADHD not only from people with Combined type ADHD but it could also tease out the individuals with Combined type ADHD with Oppositional Defiance Disorder and the people without ADHD. The authors concluded that the brain pathways for impulsive behavior, urgency, sensation seeking and perserverance may explain the symptoms of the different types of ADHD.

Perseverance training is, I think, something that we, who have symptoms of Inattentive ADHD or who have children with Inattentive ADHD, need to work on if we are to improve the symptoms of ADHD-PI.

For two decades, he conducted an extensive research project on the effects of relocating poor inner-city black families in public housing to subsidized housing in the white middle-class suburbs of Chicago. This quasi-natural experiment, known as the Gautreaux Program, has enabled him to study the effects of these moves on children's educational outcomes and job opportunities, as well as the social and economic effects on the mothers. These studies encouraged the federal government to create its Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program, implemented by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A specialist in research on work, education, and housing opportunities, Rosenbaum has published six books and numerous articles on these subjects.
Rosenbaum has testified before Congressional committees on several occasions. He is a member of the Technical Review Panel for the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) in the U.S. Department of Education. Rosenbaum's research has contributed to the design of award-winning community college reforms, federal and state policies, and programs to improve college access for low-income students.
How Can College Be for All? While the nation’s high schools have embraced the idea of trying to get all high school seniors into college, little attention has been paid to the processes that increase the number of students who actually go and complete their degree.

They’re all using predictive analytics to meet their respective goals. In the case of Netflix, the goal is to correctly guess consumers’ viewing preferences. For Amazon, it’s to drive sales by suggesting appealing products for specific people to purchase.
At Benchmark Senior Living, the goal is to increase staff retention, and consequently reduce turnover.
Benchmark on Wednesday announced it is joining other senior living providers in partnering with Baltimore-based Arena, a firm that specializes in using data analytics to help health care organizations hire employees who will stick around for the long-term. Coincidentally, Arena uses some of the same technology as Netflix and Amazon to accomplish this, Arena founder and CEO Mike Rosenbaum told Senior Housing News.
Lowering turnover is a major goal of many senior housing organizations, especially given that the national assisted living turnover rate stands at 31%, according to the most recent Assisted Living Salary & Benefits Report from the Hospital & Healthcare Compensation Service.
But the task is made more complicated by the fact that roughly 65% of caregivers are “always looking for a better job,” according to recent research.
Arena has managed to reduce turnover by a median of 38% across all of its health care clients, and at senior living providers, “the numbers tend to be higher than that,” Rosenbaum said.
In fact, Arena essentially promises that it can reduce senior living organizations’ turnover by at least 10%.

This is a question that many parents around the world have. The parents do end up paying the fees but are left wondering what exactly they are paying for.
We decided it may be helpful to give a run-down on the competition fee structure and what exactly you are getting for your money.
Your child’s cheer gym, dance studio or high school must pay a fee to the event to register your child for competition. This fee may not be per team, but per team member or per routine entered. The event has to cover the cost of renting the facility, and we all know cheerleading and dance competition venues are rarely held at school gymnasiums anymore. The event producers must also pay their judges, which could consist of an estimated 20-30 judges working approximately 24 hours over the course of the event. The event in turn has their own staff to pay. They have staff working admission at the door, working behind the scenes at the event (coordinating the warm-up room, coordinating back-stage, etc.), and in most cases, there are staff on the mat with your children as spotters. The event purchases trophies, banners, medals, team gifts, and more to ensure that winners are rewarded. And finally, the management of the event company needs to make a salary.

Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, a/k/a “Isaac Rosenbaum,” 60, pleaded guilty today to an information charging him with three counts of acquiring, receiving, and otherwise transferring human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation; and one count of conspiracy to do the same. Rosenbaum was originally charged with the conspiracy by Complaint in July 2009.
The defendant entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Anne E. Thompson in Trenton federal court. Rosenbaum’s convictions are the first under the federal statute involving the black market sales of kidneys from paid donors.
Rosenbaum admitted that from January 2006 through February 2009, he conspired with others to provide a service, in exchange for large payments, to individuals seeking kidney transplants by obtaining kidneys from paid donors. Specifically, Rosenbaum admitted to arranging three transplants on behalf of New Jersey residents that took place in December 2006, September 2008 and February 2009. Rosenbaum admitted that he was paid approximately $120,000, $150,000 and $140,000, respectively on behalf of these three recipients.
Rosenbaum’s kidney business was exposed through the use of cooperating criminal defendant Solomon Dwek and an undercover FBI agent (the “UC”) who was posing as an employee of Dwek and who represented to Rosenbaum that her uncle was in need of a kidney transplant.

Autistic people may have daily living, or ‘adaptive,’ skills that are far worse than their intelligence quotient (IQ) would predict. For instance, they may have a high IQ but be unable to hold down a job because they cannot navigate public transportation.
Other studies have reported that this discrepancy is especially significant in autistic people who have traits of other psychiatric conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression2.

Some applaud these sites for allowing the younger generation to have a platform from which their voice can be heard, but it also has its dark side; something which young people can be especially vulnerable to.
The chance of mental health problems rises in comparison with the time spent on social media. So a young person who is on social media all day is three times more likely to suffer from depression than a peer who uses it once or twice a day. Other studies show a link between the two factors kicking in at just two hours of social media a day, much less than would usually be classed as ‘heavy use’ in a teenager or young adult.
Checking social media on their mobile before sleep wakes up the brain and can trigger worries, and many wake and check things several times through the night too. Sleep deprivation can affect brain development, and make us function badly too.
Photos posted to Facebook and Instagram are not always true and fair images of the person in the shot. From the pouting selfie to the airbrushed full length, they can be used to create

Justin Bieber (who, like Bobby Orr and Wayne Gretzky, hails from just down the road from me in Canada) does give concerts that probably exceed the weekly dose of exposure of noise or music exposure, using even the most conservative of estimates (such as that of OSHA). In the claim, a woman maintained that after attending one of his concerts she experienced severe tinnitus, hyperacusis, and a reduced quality of life.
Claimant’s lawyer (we’ll call him Perry Mason): Did you know that loud music can cause hearing loss?

Abdominal swelling is an indication of several complications within the body, which includes non-digestive-related problems. It could even be indications of serious disorders like ovarian cancer and cysts, as well as heart failure. Find out more about these conditions in this article.
Ovarian cancer is one of the cancers with the highest mortality rates, even if it affects only women. What’s worse, there are no tests that can truly discern if a woman has developed cancer in her ovaries. Scientists are still currently trying to find out how to diagnose ovarian cancer in her earliest stage since it is in the early stages that the cancer can be cured.
If any of these symptoms appear together with abdominal swelling, it would do a person well to immediately go to her doctor and get a diagnosis.
Ovarian cysts are caused by the failure of a follicle to burst and dissolve if an egg does not become fertilized by sperm. It can also be caused by an imbalance between the female estrogen and progesterone hormones.
Symptoms of ovarian cysts include abdominal swelling, since cysts that burst can cause irritation in the abdominal tissues. Together with this, some symptoms of ovarian cysts include pain or pressure in the abdomen area. Ovarian

We all do it, especially in the beginning. Those first few honeymoon months are some of the most amazing months any couple can ever have. But in a strange way, they are also the most superficial: you don’t really know the person you’re with, and so you just kind of fill in the blanks, so to speak, with what you want to be true.
Only, often it’s not true. You see, we normally learn pretty quickly whether we’re in love with a person or with an idea. The problem is that we are in love with a whole host of ideas, including the ideas we have about relationships. We grew up on movies and TV that sell us on the romance of being in relationships

Despite the seemingly overwhelming evidence that the 2017 mass murder on the Las Vegas Strip may have been motivated by extreme-right-wing ideology, law enforcement officials still say they have no idea what caused Stephen Paddock to commit one of the deadliest mass shootings of all time.
After losing a court battle to keep them private, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on Wednesday released a trove of documents from the investigation into the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that left 58 people dead in Las Vegas.
The 1,200 pages of police reports, eyewitness accounts and interviews reveal that Paddock shared some of the same narratives espoused by the right-wing nuts who believe that the government is coming to confiscate their guns and implement martial law.
“Somebody has to wake up the American public and get them to arm themselves. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made,” Paddock allegedly told the man.
The idea that FEMA camps would lead to martial law is a popular conspiracy among far-right groups on the internet and paramilitary militia organizations like the Three Percenters and anti-government groups like the Patriot movement.
Another woman said she overheard a conversation between Paddock and another person in a restaurant about the 1990s standoffs at Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge in Idaho. These two events are touchstone events in right-wing, anti-government circles and the white supremacy movement.
One of the more interesting stories buried in the documents concerns a

What five things should you never hear a public relations practitioner say?
1) “I can guarantee you media coverage”: If a PR person ever tells you this, run. Not only can a public relations pro NOT guarantee you coverage, but it’s also getting harder than ever to garner coverage for clients in the current media environment.
There are at least four PR people for every reporter. If you want a guaranteed spot in any media outlet, be prepared to pay for an ad.
2) “Yes, they’ll print your press release verbatim”: No. No, they won’t. A reputable publication may use your press release to pull information for a story, but any reporter worth his or her salt won’t just take what you say about yourself and put it in print.

It’s important to know what you need to do in case of a car accident, but you should also know what to do if you’ve been injured. If you’re injured in a car accident, it adds a whole different element to your case. Not only do you have to worry about car damage, but you also have to worry about damage to yourself. With that in mind, here are a few questions and answers about car accidents, injuries and how you should proceed.
What should I do if I’ve been injured in an accident?
If you’ve been injured in an auto accident, it’s important to seek proper medical care and make sure a police report is filed. Without these things, there’s no record of your accident or the injuries that result because of it, and it will be almost impossible to pursue compensation. Regardless of if you think you are injured or not, you should always seek medical care to ensure there are no underlying problems caused by the collision.

I hope you enjoy gambling with your thyroid health, because that is exactly what you are doing. An adequate iodine oral intake is approximately 100 micrograms per day (there are 1000 mcg per 1 mg!). Iodine toxicity occurs with intakes of over two mg per day, so you are taking a toxic amount.
If you have been on this dose for several months, you may have caused hypothyroidism and induced a goiter with this excessive amount of iodine. You need to reduce it now.
You would be wise to establish your thyroid baselines. Have a TSH (thyroid-stimulating blood test –3rd generation) test and consider having your urinary amount of iodine checked as well.
The ThyroPlex formula you were taking contains tissue extracts of ovary, thyroid, brain (hypothalamus), pituitary, and adrenal . . . do you have any idea what you are taking? If I don’t know, neither do you!

Use numbers or do math.
Aphasia varies in severity. Someone with a mild form called anomia usually just has trouble finding words during conversation. Someone whose language abilities are severely impaired, however, is said to have global aphasia.
Aphasia is usually caused by stroke. It may also be caused by a head injury, a brain tumour, or a neurological disease. Aphasia is typically caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. This is the dominant hemisphere, or side of the brain responsible for language, in nearly all right-handed and most left-handed people. You might hear about damage to Broca’s area or Wernicke’s area, though aphasia can result from damage to other brain areas as well.
There is also one type of aphasia that is not caused by damage to the brain: Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). PPA is a degenerative disorder and a type of dementia that impairs language before other cognitive functions. While PPA will get worse over time, treatment is still effective in prolonging language abilities and should be started immediately after a diagnosis is received.

As car companies focus more and more on light-weight, yet durable materials, plastic tank radiators with aluminum cores have become increasingly more common. While you may think using plastic to cool a vehicle may seem strange , plastic tanks have proven to be an effective tool in helping to keep your engine cool. Plastic used in your radiator is not your normal plastic, and really a blend of mostly nylon, glass and polymers. Plastic tank radiators are chosen for their extreme light weight and are more adaptable to adding fittings and brackets. Some argue that plastic radiators are not as well made as all-metal radiators, but time has proven them well suited to the cooling system and the extreme heats that are generated. Most people have no idea what material their radiator is made out of.
No matter what kind of radiator you have, after years of usage, it is possible to develop a cooling system leak and need a radiator repair or some other cooling system service.
The number one cause of needing a radiator repair is the failure to change the antifreeze when called for and keeping coolant at appropriate levels. Ensuring your coolant is at correct levels is critical to keeping your vehicle from overheating. Old or expired coolant must be changed to keep protecting your cooling system. Your antifreeze may look ok, but if it’s old, change it. If a refill is needed, be sure to use the appropriate 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water.

You see, I live in a gym-desert. There are no options near my house – a residential area of south Seattle – and there are few options near where I work in Pioneer Square. There’s one old, run-down YMCA but I just need energy in my workouts. So when Orangetheory opened up downtown, though it was over a mile away, I signed up as a founder at their location. I did Orangetheory for a year and this is what happened.
I can see why; what I like about it is that it got me running when normally I wouldn’t. They mix each workout up so much – going up hills, going “all out” (at fastest speed), taking a walking break – every day is different. It can get even a non-runner running. And you can always power walk if needed. In the weight room, the moves are pretty standard: lunges, squats, deadlifts, push-ups, bicep curls, tricep extensions, plank and other abs, TRX straps, bench presses with free weights that kind of thing. Orangetheory utilizes heart rate monitors that pop up on a screen and the idea is that when you’re training in the “orange” zone, you’re going to maximize the after-burn, dipping into energy stores well after you walk out of the gym door.

I have some fond memories of the short period (or periodS I should say) I was in college, however one of them stands out more so than the rest; probably because I STILL can't believe it happened!
It was when I was taking an Introduction to Biology class and I was sitting next to one of the friends I had made in the class. In the previous class two days before, we had taken one of the bigger unit tests and I wasn't sure whether I did good or bad.
I remember seeing that number at the top of my page and feeling my jaw completely drop wide open! My friend sitting next to me said I turned beet red, so she apparently jumped to the conclusion that I was the one who had failed.
I honestly don't think I've ever gotten a perfect score on a big test like this one. I guess it's one of those things that happens to every person at least once (or so my sister told me; it's happened to her once or twice before, too).

I’d definitely stay here again and loved our stay.
Location – The location of this hotel was honestly perfect. It’s in the French Quarter but away from the craziness of Bourbon Street and only about 5-10 minutes walking from all the main areas of the Quarter. It was also easy access on and off the freeways and was super easy to get around.
Decor – The hotel is a really old New Orleans landmark and IHG did a fantastic job with the renovation. The decor is simple and historic but also modern and hip. I loved the decor throughout the hotel, keeping consistent with old world charm and decor alongside new and modern design.
Large Suite – Upon arrival, we had booked a balcony room so we’d have a street view of the French Quarter. I’m not sure what happened, but we were upgraded to a large suite when we arrived. Our large room was huge and had a large sitting room, a big bedroom and a huge master bathroom. We couldn’t complain!

The blast reportedly happened in a residential home after firefighters were called to reports of a gas leak at a house in The Bronx area early on Tuesday morning.
The New York Post reported that firefighters arrived at the house and discovered what appeared to be a "homemade drug laboratory" before calling police.
The explosion happened around 7.30am, after the property had been evacuated and cops and firefighters were walking in and out.
The fire department captain, named as Battalion Chief Michael J. Fahy, was rushed to hospital, but he tragically later died from his injuries.
Eight other people were injured - including seven cops who were with the NYPD Emergency Services Unit, and another firefighter.
Locals reported hearing a "huge boom".
Maureen Murphy, 45, said she was terrified by the noise: “When I came out of my house this morning I got really scared.
"The police, the fire department, everybody was rushing in here."
She added: “I live about three blocks away and I heard the explosion — it was loud, my windows shook. It was so close.
Streets had been closed off in the area and video footage appeared to show a destroyed home.

You see, I live in a gym-desert. There are no options near my house – a residential area of south Seattle – and there are few options near where I work in Pioneer Square. There’s one old, run-down YMCA but I just need energy in my workouts. So when Orangetheory opened up downtown, though it was over a mile away, I signed up as a founder at their location. I did Orangetheory for a year and this is what happened.
I can see why; what I like about it is that it got me running when normally I wouldn’t. They mix each workout up so much – going up hills, going “all out” (at fastest speed), taking a walking break – every day is different. It can get even a non-runner running. And you can always power walk if needed. In the weight room, the moves are pretty standard: lunges, squats, deadlifts, push-ups, bicep curls, tricep extensions, plank and other abs, TRX straps, bench presses with free weights that kind of thing. Orangetheory utilizes heart rate monitors that pop up on a screen and the idea is that when you’re training in the “orange” zone, you’re going to maximize the after-burn, dipping into energy stores well after you walk out of the gym door. When I got tired of Crossfit, I needed new fitness motivation

The Nagpur - bound Duronto Express was derailed near Asangaon today morning. So far there have been no casualties reported.
The incident occurred at around 6:30 am and the reason of the derailment is considered to be a landslide. The morning peak time of local trains got hampered due to this catastrophe, however, the stretch of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Kalyan remain unaffected.
Six coaches and an engine is reported to be derailed but fortunately, according to the latest updates, no one is claimed to have been injured.
The accident happened around 6:30 to 6:40 in the morning; suddenly we all experienced a jolt that made us sure that probably the train has got derailed. A sense of fright was spread amongst all and no one could figure out what exactly happened so, the chaos led people to make phone calls. I saw babies crying and senior citizens getting worried; at that moment we all just wanted to get out of the train and when we got out we saw four coaches lying horizontally on the track and I was travelling on the fourth one. The engine was toppled and we could see the tires coming out. This entire incident occurred at around quarter to seven and since the area was located in an isolated place, the poor connectivity led the rescue train come after two hours of the incident. Thankfully the RPF persons were quick; they immediately made the phone calls to

Bridges were being shut down and some opened with others staying closed until the ice fell off the cables onto the road instead of onto the cars like the last time 3 weeks ago. They opened the cable stay bridge before the ice came crashing down so quite a few cars got smashed. The ice wasn’t anywhere near as bad as it was this time. I started hearing this creak and then crash. Scared the crap out of me the first time it happened. This was the neighbors tree that fell and what was hanging severely low I figured would have broken off but it did not.
These next 3 pictures are of my side yard as the tree limbs started falling. I had to keep racing downstairs to see what got hit to make sure it wasn’t serious. There is one pine tree in my neighbors back yard that has maybe 1-2 branches left after everything else fell. The tree limbs were still falling into the night. I think the last was around 10 PM.

I have some fond memories of the short period (or periodS I should say) I was in college, however one of them stands out more so than the rest; probably because I STILL can't believe it happened!
It was when I was taking an Introduction to Biology class and I was sitting next to one of the friends I had made in the class. In the previous class two days before, we had taken one of the bigger unit tests and I wasn't sure whether I did good or bad.
I remember seeing that number at the top of my page and feeling my jaw completely drop wide open! My friend sitting next to me said I turned beet red, so she apparently jumped to the conclusion that I was the one who had failed.
I honestly don't think I've ever gotten a perfect score on a big test like this one. I guess it's one of those things that happens to every person at least once (or so my sister told me; it's happened to her once or twice before, too).

Decor – The hotel is a really old New Orleans landmark and IHG did a fantastic job with the renovation. The decor is simple and historic but also modern and hip. I loved the decor throughout the hotel, keeping consistent with old world charm and decor alongside new and modern design.
Large Suite – Upon arrival, we had booked a balcony room so we’d have a street view of the French Quarter. I’m not sure what happened, but we were upgraded to a large suite when we arrived.

This right can be limited if the court or the DFPS does not think it is in your child’s best interest to visit with you or if allowing visitation conflicts with another court order, such as a protective order.
A judge can order visitation to be either supervised or unsupervised and order other limits as needed. For example, the judge may order where the visits will occur, who will supervise, or who may be there during them. The rules about visitation should always take into account what is in your child’s best interest at that time. Please see Appendix E on Page 158 to familiarize yourself with documents CPS uses to describe the different stages of visitation, what a visitation plan should look like, when visitation is not authorized, and what CPS documents when it supervises or observes visitation between you and your child.
The right to visit with your child will be one of the most important rights you have during a CPS case. Not only will visits allow you to keep in contact with your children, something that is probably very important emotionally both to you and your child during this difficult separation, but it also gives you the opportunity to show CPS how well you can parent and why the court should allow your children to come home.

Not surprisingly, adult children with aging parents in memory care frequently have anxiety and questions about visiting their loved ones. Common concerns include: Will mom/dad even know who I am? What should I say? Do my visits have any value? How often should I visit mom/dad in memory care?
This type of apprehension is understandable say memory care experts and is typically the result of a lack of information about how the parent will respond. Memory care specialists add that these fears should not become an obstacle to visiting the loved one because visits from family and friends can be highly beneficial.
According to the Alzheimer’s Society, memory care research shows that even though a person with dementia may no longer recognize a loved one, their time together has a lasting, positive impact. They list 5 reasons to continue visiting your loved one with dementia, even after it seems their dementia is too advanced to benefit from time together.
They may recognize you even if they cannot express it.
Even if they are unable to remember your relationship, they may remember how often you visit.
They may enjoy visits even if they cannot remember your name or your relationship to them.

My clients were feeling overwhelmed and stuck. Those feelings resulted in procrastination and lack of motivation to tackle their organizational challenges. Yet in each of these cases, they recognized that no movement forward was going to happen unless they reached out for help. They had hit a wall of overwhelm. They called me for help.
It was fascinating to see the transformation. By talking about their goals, offering organizing support, and working by their sides, their feelings of overwhelm lifted and their motivation returned. In between organizing visits they were able to accomplish a lot on their own. They no longer felt stuck and had a renewed sense of purpose and energy around what they wanted to accomplish. They found the path forward.
So while enlisting the help of a professional organizer isn't the only way to jumpstart your waning motivation, it is definitely one of the effective strategies.
If you're struggling with moving forward and your lack of motivation and clarity is blocking you, reach out for help. You may be surprised at how valuable it is to hire a professional organizer or enlist the help from a trusted family member or friend.
Have you ever experienced positive change in motivation after enlisting help? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Come join the conversation!

BETHPAGE, N.Y. (TheStreet) -- The sudden departure of Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge at Cablevision(:CVC) has analysts wondering if the company is a buyout target in the coming months.
Several analysts believe that with the highly regarded Rutledge's exit, the company could be a takeover target, as the Dolan family may seek an exit strategy in the coming months. Comcast(:CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable(:TWC) are two of the most logical buyers, according to Bernstein Research.
In a research note, Bernstein Research's Craig Moffett wrote, "TWC and Comcast could team up and divide the assets, as they did with Adelphia (TWC in that scenario would take New York City, Rockland, Westchester, and Long Island, and Comcast would take Northern New Jersey and Conneticut), but that sure wouldn't generate much of a bidding war." He rates shares of Cablevision at market perform with a $20 price target.
Deutsche Bank analyst Douglas Mitchelson noted that Rutledge has helped drive the strongest penetration and ARPUs (average revenue per user) in the industry, which could potentially be attractive to a potential bidder.
Rutledge has a one-year no compete clause in his contract, and according to a Reuters article, there is speculation he might join rival Charter Communications(:CHTR).
Cablevision's video, broadband, and voice penetration are all significantly higher than the sector average. The company is generating $152 per month in revenue from basic video services, 14% higher than the $133 average, according to Mitchelson's note.

Most of our patients initially seek our help when they are in pain and are having difficulty performing their everyday tasks. Patients in this acute stage are looking for pain relief. During this stage your visits are likely to be frequent and aimed at reducing pain and improving your symptoms.
After the acute symptoms have been reduced, our aim is to restore proper function to the area of concern. This will typically require regular, but less frequent, clinic visits than the acute stage. This type of chiropractic care may continue longer depending on your age, how long you have had the complaint, and how severe the problem is.
Chronic chiropractic care is given to patients whose complaints are typically complex, longstanding, and where the complaint has no acute or inflammatory symptoms. Patients who require chronic care are usually given exercises, stretches and other activities to do at home, at work, or during sporting activities. They still require clinic visits to assess progress but these are generally less frequent than with acute care.

You may be used to thinking of separation anxiety as a set of behaviors young toddlers commonly exhibit when separating from their primary caregiver. In fact, if your kids have already ‘grown out’ of this crying-and-clinging stage, it can be frustrating to see separation anxiety pop back up in relation to parental visitation with your ex.
Yet when families go through major changes, such as a move, new separation, or divorce, it’s common for parents to see some old patterns reappear, even for older kids.
Remember, too, that your kids may experience these separation anxiety behaviors even if there’s no reason for them. In other words, your kids don’t have to have a good, sound reason to be afraid of sleeping over your ex’s house for them to go through separation anxiety as the visit approaches. This is because the anxiety they’re experiencing isn’t necessarily rational.
And if you’re the primary caregiver, figuring out the difference between what’s irrational and what’s legitimate can be one of the most challenging aspects of navigating separation anxiety in relation to parental visitation.
As separation anxiety before a visit begins to set in, your child may not be thinking rationally. That’s why it’s even more important for you to be rational and keep your own separation anxiety in check.

Many people on the autism spectrum find visual aids and prompts useful in helping them to understand what will happen next and importantly when something will end. Therefore the aids that have been developed for ‘an eye-test’ use a pictorial narrative that can help the patient understand what is required of them and what will happen.
Consider arranging an initial appointment to familiarise the person on the autism spectrum with the consulting room and equipment so that they know what to expect during the eye test. Alternatively, provide accessible information about what will be involved.
Knowing when something will happen is important to a person on the autism spectrum, as it can help them feel more secure and less anxious. Try and ensure that appointments begin and end when planned.
If relevant, speak to the parent or carer before the appointment to learn what the patient may like or dislike or respond well to, for instance counting, shapes, lights, TV characters, and so on. You could use these to help them feel more relaxed during their appointment.
