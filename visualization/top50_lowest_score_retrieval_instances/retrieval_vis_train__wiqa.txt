Do you prefer to eat breakfast first then do your morning fitness routine, or do you skip breakfast altogether? Researchers from the United Kingdom look at how eating versus fasting before exercise can affect a person's metabolism and workout.
Eating before exercise can impact metabolism in important ways, a new study finds.
The scientists, who hail from several prestigious academic institutions in the United Kingdom — the Universities of Bath, Birmingham, Newcastle, and Stirling — looked into how eating a morning meal before cycling for an hour would affect the body versus the effects of fasting before cycling.
The findings — reported in the American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology and Metabolism — indicate that eating first actually helps the body burn more carbohydrates during exercise.
Not just that, but having breakfast before a morning cycle can actually also help digestion after a workout, the study suggests.
"This is the first study to examine the ways in which breakfast before exercise influences our responses to meals after exercise," says co-lead researcher Dr. Javier Gonzalez.
"We found that, compared to skipping breakfast, eating breakfast before exercise increases the speed at which we digest, absorb, and metabolize carbohydrate that we may eat after exercise."
What happens if you eat before exercising?
For this study, Dr. Gonzalez and colleagues recruited 12 healthy male participants. To obtain control measurements, the researchers asked the study participants to have breakfast and then rest for 3 hours.
For the experiment itself, participants had a breakfast of porridge with milk, and 2 hours after this, they

Now, some believe that wearing the garment can help in getting rid of body fat especially those located within the stomach area. So the big question is this: does wearing a girdle help slim your tummy? Is there scientific proof of the claim and its efficacy? Let’s find out.
What Does A Girdle Do To Your Body?
When you wrap a tight corset around your waist and tummy, the fat tissues concentrated there get distributed around a wider area thus making you look slimmer than usual. The girdle doesn’t in any way affect the composition of your body or the fats that it distributes around. With that said, the effects of a girdle are purely aesthetic in nature. You may look good wearing it, but once you remove it, the fats will return to where they were originally situated.
Some professional nutritionists say that a girdle can have a significant impact on a person’s weight but not in the way you expect. According to Franci Cohen and Cora Harrington, two renowned nutritionists, the girdle helps in suppressing food intake. The logic is that in the long run, you will be eating less thus you will be losing some weight. This effect happens if you wear the girdle while eating. When your stomach expands because of the food, it will strain against the girdle. The feeling of contraption will serve as your signal that you are probably eating too much. So you stop and avoid taking more calories than

I have long been a proponent of eating breakfast. When discussing the topic with patients I always mention a study that concluded that those skip breakfast are 80% more likely to become obese than those who do eat breakfast.
From what I have read from studies, and what I have observed anecdotally, breakfast sets the stage for how we feel throughout the day. Eating breakfast can affect concentration, focus, energy levels, food cravings, and more throughout the day. Eating breakfast can set us up for having a lethargic, hum drum day or having a high energy, feel good day.
Skipping breakfast will cause the body to go into a starvation state. It will extend the fast from nighttime through to the next meal. This can cause the body to prepare for an upcoming fast. When a body is preparing for a fast, whatever food you eat will be stored as fat to prepare for starvation. So whatever food you eat after fasting all night will be stored as fat instead of burned for energy.

While this type of system is often more expensive to run, there are many different factors affecting its running costs. And, unlike their gas-powered cousins, electric systems can accommodate air conditioning installations using their existing blower motors and ductwork. This makes them a clear winner for homes located in areas with excessively hot summer temperatures.
When it comes to cost, an HVAC system's hardware is one of the leading factors in the cost of running it. Different manufacturers, models, and system sizes all utilize different amounts of energy. And some systems that are rated Energy Star compliant use less energy than systems that aren't.
The HVAC system's ductwork located under your house or in the attic space is responsible for moving around all of the heated or cooled air. Since the air can be cooled or warmed by the outdoor temperature, it must be well insulated and all of its connections must be sealed tight with duct tape.
The insulation in your home determines how much heat transfer happens between indoors and the outside. The more winter heat and summer cooling you lose to the outdoors, then the more your HVAC system will need to run to keep your family comfortable.

Many factors affect the food habits and these may include culture, geographical location, the health and lifestyle of an individual, their religion, social, and economic factors among other things (Bellisle, 2012, p.1).
As a geographical factor, climate significantly affects our eating habits. This is because climate determines the period through which food grows and also affects the planting seasons every year. Since every region experiences different weather, there is also a difference in the output. Most of the warmer regions tend to have three to four crop cycles every year. On the other hand, the colder regions tend to have one annual crop cycle. Similarly, seasons also influence the food habits and cultures that are developed by different people because most individuals will often choose to consume different kinds of foods during different seasons, be it summer or winter (Bellisle, 2012, p. 1). For example, hot pot is usually popular with most people in China during the cold winter, because it helps to warm them up.

The werewolf diet, also called the Lunar Diet, touts that you can lose weight (2-6 pounds in a day!) and improve your immune system by fasting and dieting according to the phases of the moon. Here’s what the diet consists of, and our take on whether it’s hip or hype.
The basics: This plan consists of two main phases, according the website moonconnection.com, which appears to be the main source of information on this new plan (there’s no book that we could find or an author that seems to be taking credit). The premise for the diet is based on the moon influencing the water in our bodies just like it influences the ocean tides.
The first phase, called the basic plan, consists of drinking nothing but freshly squeezed fruit or vegetable juice and water for 24 hours during either a full moon or new moon. The plan claims that this helps rid your body of toxins and that you can lose up to 6 pounds of water weight in a day, although they say that 2-3 pounds is most common.
The second phase, the extended plan, covers what you should do during all phases of the moon: full moon, waning moon, new moon, and waxing moon. Following the full moon fast, during the waning moon period, it’s recommend that you drink plenty of fluids (64 ounces of water a day) and eat a “balanced diet”. During the new moon

Clinical Dietitian Amy Ekin from St John of God Murdoch Hospital offers her tips for staying well by eating the right way.
The first thing is to maintain a healthy weight by being physically active and eating a balanced diet. It may lower your overall risk of cancer or its recurrence.
Follow a diet based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines. This will help maintain a healthy weight.
• Limit foods with saturated fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol.
• Care for your food. Prepare and store it safely.
Physical activity improves fitness, increases energy levels and decreases fatigue and stress. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days.
What do I eat while I’m undergoing treatment?
During cancer treatment, you are advised to maintain a healthy weight or prevent weight loss. It is important to have adequate fluid and a nourishing diet during chemotherapy treatment as it can affect appetite and cause taste changes.
It is preferable to have non-caffeinated fluids like water, milk and juice as excess intake of caffeinated fluids can cause loss of water from body. Talk to your dietitian to find out details of a nourishing diet during chemotherapy.

However, while summer has its merits and may be a happy time for kids, parents still have a lot on their hands and it's difficult to find ways to effectively balance the demands of life. Parents may struggle to spend quality time with their kids and this may affect them emotionally, especially during the summer when their kids are more available.
There are a number of things that you can do as a parent to create that time with your kids during the summer break.
Declare and consecrate at least 60 minutes a day as family time and be sure to make it clear that during this time no devices will be used. Use this time for family fun, play a board game, go for a walk and take the time to not only talk with but listen to your children. If you work full-time and can't manage a daily family hour be sure to take advantage of weekends and holidays; consider them a golden hour with your family as the priority.

While this type of system is often more expensive to run, there are many different factors affecting its running costs. And, unlike their gas-powered cousins, electric systems can accommodate air conditioning installations using their existing blower motors and ductwork. This makes them a clear winner for homes located in areas with excessively hot summer temperatures.
When it comes to cost, an HVAC system's hardware is one of the leading factors in the cost of running it. Different manufacturers, models, and system sizes all utilize different amounts of energy. And some systems that are rated Energy Star compliant use less energy than systems that aren't.
The HVAC system's ductwork located under your house or in the attic space is responsible for moving around all of the heated or cooled air. Since the air can be cooled or warmed by the outdoor temperature, it must be well insulated and all of its connections must be sealed tight with duct tape.
The insulation in your home determines how much heat transfer happens between indoors and the outside. The more winter heat and summer cooling you lose to the outdoors, then the more your HVAC system will need to run to keep your family comfortable.

Recent studies show that rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and dreaming may actually help alleviate stress. Read on to find out why dreaming may be good for you.
What happens during the REM sleep phase?
There are five distinct sleep phases which the brain and body cycle through during the night. The first four phases involve a transition from shallow to deep sleep, while the fifth phase, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, involves heightened brain activity and vivid dreams.
According to Mathew Walker, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkley, during REM sleep your brain becomes highly active. There is more activity in the visual, motor, emotional and autobiographical memory regions of the brain, but decreased activity in other regions that control rational thought—hence why your dreams are nonsensical.
Psychologist, Rubin Naiman, a sleep and dream specialist at the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine describes the brain during REM sleep as a sort of "second gut" that digests all of the information gathered that day; dreams act as an active filter for our daily experiences. Some scientists theorise that dreams help the brain separate important memories from non-important ones, and help you prepare yourself mentally for challenges by playing out various scenarios in your head.
What are the health benefits of REM sleep and dreaming?
Numerous recent studies suggest that REM and dreaming can affect how accurately you read facial expressions and process your environment.

Four different muscles connect to the lower jaw to facilitate its movement. These muscles are the masseter, the temporalis, the medial pterygoid, and the lateral pterygoid. Each of these muscles occurs in pairs, with one of each muscle appearing on either side of the skull. The muscles work in combination to pivot the lower jaw up and down and to allow movement of the jaw from side to side.
Fractures to this bone may be minor or severe, with more severe fractures requiring the jaw to be wired shut to prevent movement during healing. Other injuries and infections that can affect the lower jaw include tendinitis, infections stemming from tooth decay or other tooth injuries, and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), which causes painful swelling where the mandible meets the cheekbone.

It was therefore hypothesized that the seasonal movement patterns of dolphins is influenced by higher quantity or quality of available prey during the same temporal period. To ascertain the potential influence of prey availability (quantity and diversity) and quality (calorific content) on the seasonal movement patterns of dolphins, the relative abundance and diversity of fish were sampled in three near shore habitats (coastal ocean, bay and estuary) using three fishing techniques: z-traps, beach seines, and gillnets, which targeted different prey species. Sampling was conducted in three summer and two winter seasons between 2008-2010. Three replicate samples were taken at each of the three sampling sites per season. Seasonal, annual, and regional comparisons in fish assemblage, abundance and calorific content were made. Seasonal trends in fish abundance (numbers and biomass of fish caught) and available calories vary depending on the species in question. Overall, there appears to be higher biomass and higher density values of calories available to the dolphins in the winter months.

Before you discuss "RMS" values with your students, it is important to cover the basic idea of how to assign fixed values to quantities that change over time. Since AC waveforms are cyclic (repeating), this is not as difficult to do as one might think.
Suppose a DC power source with a voltage of 50 volts is connected to a 10 W load. How much power will this load dissipate?
Now suppose the same 10 W load is connected to a sinusoidal AC power source with a peak voltage of 50 volts. Will the load dissipate the same amount of power, more power, or less power? Explain your answer.
50 volts DC applied to a 10 W load will dissipate 250 watts of power. 50 volts (peak, sinusoidal) AC will deliver less than 250 watts to the same load.
There are many analogies to explain this discrepancy between the two "50 volt" sources. One is to compare the physical effort of a person pushing with a constant force of 50 pounds, versus someone who pushes intermittently with only a peak force of 50 pounds.
In this condition of equal power dissipation, how much voltage is the AC power supply outputting? Be as specific as you can in your answer.
120 volts AC RMS, by definition.

Amiodarone affects the rhythm of your heartbeats.
Amiodarone is used to help keep the heart beating normally in people with life-threatening heart rhythm disorders of the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart that allow blood to flow out of the heart). Amiodarone is used to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
Amiodarone is for use only in treating life-threatening heart rhythm disorders.
Amiodarone takes a long time to completely clear from your body. You may continue to have side effects from amiodarone after you stop using it.
You should not take this medicine if you are allergic to amiodarone or iodine, or if you have heart block, a history of slow heartbeats that have caused you to faint, or if your heart cannot pump blood properly.

Wind and rain can be annoying, and some might call it distracting or disruptive, especially while hunting.
But wind isn’t all bad. It can be quite refreshing. Think about when that perfect breeze blows through just in time to cool you off on that hot summer day. You can’t beat that! Rain on the other hand… is necessary but to be honest, it’s not my favorite product of nature.
What do deer have to say about those rainy and breezy days in the forest?
In a 2015 post, Leah Giralico wrote about the unexpected way wind was affecting deer movements. Instead of slowing them down, it was increasing their movements during the day.
This seemed counterintuitive to nearly everyone. In a reader survey about white-tailed deer movement, almost 90% thought that wind would cause deer to reduce their movements! About 53% believed rain reduced deer movement and 11% felt that rain would increase deer movement.
Over half of readers agreed that a significantly windy day would affect deer movements.
Leah analyzed data from October 2013 and discovered that male and female deer were moving more during windy days and less during windy nights. Even slight air movement made a difference in deer activity. With regard to precipitation, she found that females were not affected but males traveled significantly less on rainy days.
If we know this already, why are we asking the same wind and rain question again? Because science likes replication. Will we get consistent results from year to

El Niño predicted to linger through summer, but what does that mean for Arizona’s monsoons?
Last fall and winter in Arizona were record-breakers. Since Oct. 1, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport has received nearly double the normal amount of rainfall. In February, Flagstaff had its snowiest day on record, with nearly 40 inches.
Forecasters say part of the reason Arizona had so many storms was a climatological pattern known as El Niño, when surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean are warmer than normal.
“When this happens, this can affect the weather patterns downstream and into the United States, particularly during the winter season,” said Mark O’Malley with the National Weather Service office in Phoenix.
El Niños, which occur every two to seven years, begin in the fall, peak that winter and normally dissipate by spring, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. The name in Spanish means “the boy,” a reference to the infant Jesus. The opposite phenomenon is La Niña: when surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific are cooler than normal.
El Niño years typically result in a wetter-than-average winter for Arizona. The conditions usually deteriorate in early spring, but in March, the Climate Prediction Center of the NOAA released an update on the current advisory.
“Weak El Niño conditions are likely to continue through the Northern Hemisphere spring 2019 (~80% chance) and summer (~60% chance),” the summary said. It also stated forecasters predict the equatorial Pacific surface temperatures will remain above normal by 0.5 to 1.0 degrees Celsius, indicating weak El Niño conditions.

Whether it’s their back, neck, shoulders, hips, or some other body part, it’s likely the result of bad movement habits they’ve developed over time.
Even something as simple as sitting at a desk all day can alter posture and change how someone moves in other areas of their life. All the while, their pain gets worse, and their risk for chronic injury goes up.
While it’s important to balance programming between upper- and lower-body movement as well as between push and pull, the most successful trainers know it doesn’t end there. Training programs should also reduce injury risk. It’s a trainer’s job to look at posture and movement patterns throughout every session and spot movement dysfunction as soon as possible.

Hunching during rows, shrugging during pullups, and driving the chin forward during planks — these are all signs of upper-trap dominance. Overactive traps can lead to weak or underactive deep neck flexors and scapular stabilizers, putting the neck and shoulders at risk of injury and pain.

As the earth moves around the sun, it is tilted slightly to one side, similar to how a globe looks with the north pole slightly off center. Have you heard of the equator? It is an imaginary line around the middle of the earth that divides earth into two halves, a northern half and a southern half. In summer, the earth is tilted so that the Northern Hemisphere (including the United States Canada, and parts of Europe) gets the most sun.
While it’s summer for us, those living in the Southern Hemisphere (including South America and Australia) are experiencing the cold weather of winter.

Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly.

Then the Ohio Department of Wildlife joined the fray, establishing the state’s first dove hunting season in 80 years—only to have a court order take it away a couple of years later. Finally in 1994 the Ohio General Assembly passed a house bill to allow dove hunting.

Red fox responded more vigorously in cold conditions while coyotes loped to a call better in warmer temperatures.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Thus far, I have harvested two in four hunts and the rifle performed perfectly. I might have taken several more, if not for the heavy canopy and dense ground cover. On several occasions I’d catch glimpses of, or hear squirrels up in the oaks cutting acorns or in the maples foraging on keys, both of which seem to be in good supply this year.

However, because of the way that many contests are held, there has been a great deal of controversy involved in regulation of contests that has caused some traditional contests to discontinue their occurrence.
For example, the WHA (World Hunting Association) hunting contest was set up as something other than a shoot to kill contest, as many have recently been set up in recent years. Instead, competitors would use drugged darts to simply knock the animal out for a period of time. However, many opposers took offense to this method, claiming it was to be considered cruelty. Although hunting altogether is often touted as cruelty, drugging animals for no apparent reason was protested as being worse, and the WHA (World Hunting Association) competitors were instructed to hunt by traditional harvest format, meaning that they would be shooting to kill.
One of the real concerns with a hunting contest is that it becomes a sport to kill only rather than one that is justified through the eventuality of the meat being eaten. Deer hunting has been regulated in many ways to assure that hunters do not harvest more than necessary for the production of venison meat and sausage. However, by creating a competition, hunters are encouraged to take as many deer as possible, as well as to seek out the largest of the population, cutting off sources of procreation.

At only a few weeks out from our favorite season of the year, there’s a lot of information to review and remember, as a seasoned pro or a beginner, about hunting safety. Unfortunately, even though most of us take the right precautions, there are still about 1,000 hunting accidents a year between the U.S. and Canada. As a responsible hunter, take the time to learn or review proper hunting safety before grabbing your gear and heading out this season.
Many fatal hunting accidents are the result of improper firearm usage, whether in groups or alone, making it important to remember the following firearm safety practices.
Keep the barrel pointed in a safe direction at all times.
Be 100% sure of your target and its backdrop before shooting. Make sure that your target isn’t in front of a flat, hard surface.
Prevent an accidental discharge by keeping your finger outside the trigger guard until you’re ready to shoot.
Unload the firearm when it’s not in use.
Point the firearm only at something you intend to shoot – joking around can be fatal.
Never use alcohol or drugs while handling a firearm.
Remember to stick to your Zone-of-Fire before shooting at any targets. Your Zone-of-Fire is the 45° area directly in front of you that you should stay in when shooting. Shooting beyond that area is considered outside your field of view and can’t be seen reliably. Remember that your Zone-of-Fire will change with every

When staghunts have been challenged about their behaviour, they have claimed they were undertaking exempt hunting, as the Hunting Act 2004 has a list of exemptions where hunting with dogs are allowed. Currently the exemption the staghunts claim the most is that they are undertaking ‘research and observation’, despite the fact we believe this is just a cover for illegal hunting. A League investigation shows what this ‘research’ looks like.
Red deer are not equipped with sweat glands in their bodies. They overheat when chased and their muscle fibre type is not adapted for endurance running(…) However, even these initial conclusions scarcely prepared me for the astonishing changes in the physiology of the hunted deer(…) In short, many of the physiological changes are seriously maladaptive and would not be expected to occur normally. The pattern of the data suggests that the hunted animals are extremely frightened as they try to escape.
The members of the Government’s Burns Inquiry committee agreed, stating: “There seems to be a large measure of agreement among the scientists that, at least during the last 20 minutes or so of the hunt, the deer is likely to suffer as glycogen depletion sets in”.

Suppose we wanted to write a new method for DLList called int get(int i). Why would get be slow for long lists compared to getLast? For what inputs would it be especially slow?
You may find the figure below useful for thinking about your answer.
It turns out that no matter how clever you are, the get method will usually be slower than getBack if we&apos;re using the doubly linked list structure described in section 2.3.
This is because, since we only have references to the first and last items of the list, we&apos;ll always need to walk through the list from the front or back to get to the item that we&apos;re trying to retrieve. For example, if we want to get item #417 in a list of length 10,000, we&apos;ll have to walk across 417 forward links to get to the item we want.
In the very worst case, the item is in the very middle and we&apos;ll need to walk through a number of items proportional to the length of the list (specifically, the number of items divided by two). In other words, our worst case execution time for get is linear in the size of the entire list. This in contrast to the runtime for getBack, which is constant, no matter the size of the list.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

Hey Derik - since you think this may be related to the WRM sizing, would you mind taking a look at it ?
I've got a proper XP box up now, and I've verified this bug happens under WRP on XP. My screen resolution is 1280 x 1024, and part of the bottom of the kepler window is hidden beneath my windows taskbar. The problem does not occur under workflow-run-manager alone, though WRM does create a Kepler window bigger than does the kepler suite. I've previously spent time making WRM as small as possible while still showing 10 rows (the minimum we decided we'd like to see), so I'll try to look into shrinking the size of Reporting.

You can actually adjust that with the loft sleeve. If you adjust the loft to the highest setting, it will close the face. If you want it to look even more shut, you can jump to the highest setting and increase loft as well.
Thanks Allan, but, I am confused for two reasons. If I adjust the loft to a higher setting, I would increase the loft, right? Suppose I want to keep the loft as is but square the face (make it not open to the target).? Second, if I adjust the loft to a higher setting (say 10.5 to 11.0) will this actually make it more open?
As you surmised, The loft sleeve affects loft by altering face angle. When you move the sleeve toward the higher setting, you're closing the face at address. The increase in loft happens if your face angle at impact is the same as it would have been with the loft sleeve in standard. In other words, if you're able to get the face open at impact relative to the face angle at address, you will have added loft.
The opposite is true for lower settings. Moving the sleeve toward the lower setting opens the face at address. The decrease in loft happens

For example, if you’ve been holding onto old boxes of your children’s clothing or toys, consider whether now is the time to give them away or donate them. If there are items of use in there, pull them out and re-appoint them accordingly.
Because purging your items can be difficult, utilize this rule: if you haven’t touched it in twelve months, it should go to someone else. This is as true for clothing as it is for household items and accessories. As you begin downsizing, attack your home room-by-room. Pick up every item in the said room and ask yourself if you’ve used it in the last year. If the answer is no, place it in a donation or throw-away pile. If you’re dealing with high-end possessions, consider handing them down to family or friends.
If you’re looking for an alternative to throwing away your unneeded items, consider having a garage sale. The perfect way to make some extra money and get rid of unwanted items at the same time, a garage sale is a must-do for anyone who is about to downsize.

Few Canadians take seriously their own lack of quality digestion, and build-up will make them sicker. The accumulation of this waste, in even the slightest ways, will promote toxin development and production. The toxins have a direct impact on the liver and kidneys. The liver is the blood factory of the body, and the source of quality blood circulation to and from the heart. Kidneys absorb and allocate nutrients from the blood.
The kidneys are directly correlated to healthy digestion and the removal of toxins. The kidneys can easily by overburdened by toxin growth, which brings everything full circle. Toxins from the intestines accumulate in the kidneys and liver. Both of these organs are greatly strained by this excess toxin production.

Any breakdown in this system can create problems for the body. Possible symptoms of poor digestion are bloating, constipation, diarrhea, cramping, weigh gain, heartburn (or acid reflux) and loss of appetite. Other symptoms less well known caused by poor digestion are arthritis, skin problems, and allergies.
How does poor digestion start?
Eating the wrong food for your body is usually the start of digestive symptoms. Many people develop digestive problems from eating foods that they have sensitivities to, as well as eating refined sugar and other processed foods. The chemicalization of our food is a big culprit.
Other potential causes for signs of poor digestion are a history of heavy antibiotic use, exposure to toxins, hormonal imbalance or infection with parasites or other microbes.
There’s several reasons why someone may experience poor digestion. If you are having symptoms, the next step is to find out what factor, or combination of factors may be causing your distress.
It is important to have a well-functioning digestive system so your body gets the nutrition it needs to thrive from the foods you eat. All nourishment and healing begins in the stomach.

These are the symptoms described by the medical profession.
This is the most common symptom of FCS. The pain can be mild, or severe and interfere with daily living. It is felt in the upper central region of the abdomen (the epigastric region) and can sometimes radiate to cause back pain. In extreme cases this can resemble peritonitis. There are reported cases of unnecessary surgery due to an incorrect diagnosis.
The pancreas is a small gland found behind the stomach responsible for secreting enzymes that help in digestion and hormones that supply different functions in the body. Acute pancreatitis happens when this gland inflames and causes pain, sometimes intense which is felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. Other symptoms of pancreatitis are nausea, sweating, chills, weakness, clammy skin and mild yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice). .
Some individuals can develop acute, recurrent pancreatitis, or necrotising pancreatis (when the pancreas starts to destroy itself). Both can be potentially lethal but are fortunately rarely occuring.

Temperatures are rising as we come into the summer months and with this, the temperature of the wastewater also increases. As a result, aerobic bacteria become more active and begin digesting BOD and other nutrients at a faster rate. The warmer the water becomes, the more active they are and the more oxygen they consume. This results in low dissolved oxygen.
Low dissolved oxygen coupled with rising temperatures can lead to an increase in anoxic zones at the bottom of wastewater aeration basins. Anaerobic digestion releases sulphur dioxide, along with a variety of other noxious gases that are the causes of wastewater odour.
Odour is often a sign that more anaerobic digestion is occurring than there should be. Given that aerobic digestion is a much faster process than anaerobic digestion, it is likely that the wastewater is being under-treated.
When gases are released from wastewater treatment plants they result in a very pungent odour which will directly affect WWTP operators and, when carried by winds, to people who live or work nearby.
Increasing oxygen supply ensures that the aerobic bacteria have the oxygen they need to aerobically digest BOD. This will help to control odours as anaerobic digestion will slow down.
Ensuring dissolved oxygen is reaching the very bottom of an aeration basin is key to avoiding odour as this is where the odour-causing anaerobic digestion occurs. By circulating the wastewater effectively, you can create nearly equal dissolved oxygen throughout. This in turn will promote odour-free aerobic digestion.
Aeration technologies currently in use are not always effective

Interesting how something that seems as insignificant as chewing your food can supposedly have such effects. To clarify, lets take a closer look at the known benefits of proper chewing.
Increasing the number of chews per bite affects hormone release in the gut that regulates appetite (3). One of these hormones, Ghrelin is found in high concentrations in the blood when fasting and suppressed after eating. Low amounts of Ghrelin signals for the decrease in hunger.
Chewing your food well takes time, but this gives the body a chance to activate hormones involved in turning off appetite. Less food is consumed as a result (2), decreasing the amount of calories taken on board. Having smaller portions as a result of feeling fuller sooner gives an advantage to those trying to control their weight by consuming less calories.

Twenty-eight billboards in metro stations and at Washington DC’s National and Dulles airports were accompanied by print and online ads, op-eds, interviews, articles, and blog posts. The ads superimposed DC-insider buzzwords such as “job creator” and “beltway outsider” with decidedly non-DC imagery—people surrounded by fishing boats in Ghana, a plant nursery in Tanzania, a roadway in Malawi.
However, we don’t yet know what will affect the US general public’s view of foreign aid.

Game of Thrones, Fate of the Furious and Jurassic World are just some of the Hollywood productions in recent years taking advantage of drone technology for stunning aerial shots. But how about the individuals who remotely pilot these drones? Where do they fit in within the entertainment industry’s labor ranks?
The question happens to be the subject of an ongoing dispute between Warner Bros. and IATSE Local 600, the International Cinematographers Guild. After the studio hired three drone technicians in 2015 for Rush Hour, a TV series based on the film franchise, the guild initiated arbitration in an attempt to get the trio health and pension benefits afforded to employees under IATSE’s collectively bargained agreement with producers. Rush Hour only lasted 13 episodes on CBS, but the labor squabble continues to this day and was made public on Tuesday when Warners went to federal court to ensure that one of the drone pilots showed up at an arbitration hearing scheduled for May 2.
Although labor arbitration within Hollywood is common especially upon new technology, the issue of drones is its own particular vehicle of dissent.

Election meddling in this way can affect outcomes, futures of countries and even presidencies. There is no doubt that it’s undesirable, so it’s laudable that information commissioner Elizabeth Denham has launched an investigation into the role of data in politics, specifically its misuse. According to a BBC report she is looking for extra powers to do something about the impact of interference in elections.
The killer sentence, however, is this one: “Given the transnational nature of data the investigation will involve exploring how companies operating internationally deploy such practices with impact or handling of data in the UK.” This is self-evidently right and nobody would dispute it.
What’s less clear is exactly what the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or even the British government could do to stop any interference that comes from other countries. Ask them to stop?

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing.

Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly.

Ensuring your employees report their baseline immunity status is important. Health Care Workers are at risk of exposure to communicable diseases while at work and many of these are vaccine-preventable. Reporting baseline immunity status helps to ensure all immunizations recommended for health care workers are completed and booster doses are provided as needed. Not only does this safeguard the health of the employees, it also protects patients in the event of an outbreak or exposure at your worksite.
What happens when my employee is not assessed?
Employees may need to be restricted from working if they do not meet the immunity status for a particular communicable disease during an exposure event.
How do my new hires obtain an assessment?
Employees can contact the Provincial Workplace Health Call Centre at 1-866-922-9464 (select Option 1) to discuss their baseline immunity status and to determine if any further vaccines or tests are needed. The Occupational Health Nurse will advise your employee of immunization clinics within your area or direct them how to obtain recommended vaccines.
New hires are any employees that have been working with their employer for 3 months or less. If you have employees that require an immunization assessment that are not newly hired, have them contact the Occupational Health Nurse for your health authority.

Some of the best surfcasting in the world happens not on a beach, but along the banks of the uniquely positioned Cape Cod Canal. Seven miles long and 480 feet wide, the Cape Cod Canal, connecting Buzzards Bay to the south and west and Cape Cod Bay to the north and east, offers the striped bass fisherman unparalleled opportunities--a fishery unlike any to be found, on any coast. The paths to successful fishing in this unique environment are fully explained in FISHING THE CAPE COD CANAL.
One key to fishing the Canal is knowing the tides and how they will affect the fishery. Another is understanding the migration patterns of the striped bass. A third is perceiving how adaptations in traditional fishing tackle―rods, reels, and line―must be made. Yet another is developing awareness of which lures catch fish, and how those lures are best manipulated. All these issues, and more, are fully explored in this exceptional book.

Klein, a two-time B.A.S.S. Angler of the Year and 29-time qualifier for the Bassmaster Classic, is at home on the water no matter when he happens to be fishing.
"I'm an angler and I like to catch them," said the eight-time winner on the B.A.S.S. tournament trail. "Whether I'm fishing in the fall, summer, winter or spring, I like to catch 'em."
That being said, Klein does admit that the fall season is a good one for an angler to be out on the water.
"One thing that makes the fall so unique for me and intriguing is the fact that you have less traffic on the water," said Klein, who has won $1.9 million in his B.A.S.S. tournament career.
"Everybody is usually in the field hunting. There's no water skiing. And all the kids are in school. So the fall is really a quiet time."

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

In fact, they can have a huge effect on how successful you become so, it’s important that you learn how to tie them correctly. Some new anglers underestimate the importance of tying knots and don’t put a lot of effort into learning how to do them right.
When you take a few minutes to think about it you can see why and how they affect the outcome of your fishing trips. The knot is what attaches the fishing line to the reel and it attaches the lures to your fishing lines. If you don’t tie the knot correctly, then you run the risk of it coming loose when you catch a fish.
If these knots are tied incorrectly, they can work themselves loose after awhile. When you hook a fish and it begins thrashing around and pulling against the line, this can pull them apart as well. When this happens, your fish will be swimming away with your bait in its mouth while you watch.
There are several different types of knots used in fishing and after you become an experienced angler, you can begin learning how to tie them all one by one. They are used in different situations and using the right knot for the type of fishing you’re doing will make your fishing trips more productive. However, when you’re first learning how to fish, here are the three main types of bass fishing knots that you need to learn how to tie.

Steelhead — large, ocean-going rainbow trout revered by anglers for their feistiness — return to the Deschutes River from the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River.
They must make their way over Bonneville Dam and then over The Dalles Dam before they can turn south into the Deschutes. From the Deschutes, they eventually find tributaries in which they can spawn in late winter and early spring.
Despite the downturn from last year, French said it has still been a “pretty good year” for steelhead fishing on the Deschutes. He noted a strong return of wild fish and of larger two-salt fish — fish that have spent two years in the Pacific Ocean and weigh 7 to 12 pounds.
And French said that stray B-run steelhead, destined for the Clearwater River in north-central Idaho, can also be caught in the Lower Deschutes this time of year while on their 900-mile migration. Those fish can weigh up to 20 pounds because they spend more time in the ocean feeding.

The most fish are caught with natural live bait. Fish eat any insects that live near them. If it is an insect that you can catch near the body of water where you are fishing, it is likely that the fish will be attracted to it. Many expensive artificial lures do more for the fisherman than the fish.
Always be cognizant about the current weather at the location where you are fishing and the forecast for the rest of the day. If you go out on the open water when a storm is brewing, the results could be disastrous. When planning your fishing trip, check out the weather.

It becomes an even more daunting task where decisions have to be made about regulating human development needs for enhancing the ecological conditions that affect the ability of species to survive. Endangered species such as the South Asian River Dolphin in the human-dominated floodplain river systems of South Asia (the Ganga, Indus, Brahmaputra & their tributaries), have to constantly adapt to survive in rivers from which diversion and abstraction of water to irrigate agricultural lands is a need for millions of farmers. Not only that, thousands of fisher folk depend on these rivers for fisheries and share space with river dolphins. As water scarcity and flow allocations to multiple sectors (agriculture, fisheries, conservation) become pressing concerns, ecological studies need to try and understand how interactions between declining river flows and resulting changes in anthropogenic risk (e.g., from fishing) affects riverine species such as dolphins.
In a recent study1, published in the journal Biological Conservation researchers at the River Dolphin Trust in Kailali, Nepal, in collaboration with conservation scientists and government officials have addressed the question how decline in river depth caused by irrigation withdrawals led to aggravating the impacts of fisheries on the small river dolphin population in the Karnali River of Nepal. In the paper titled “Irrigation demands aggravate fishing threats to river dolphins in Nepal”, the researchers focused their investigation on the population-level responses of river dolphins to natural flood-induced change in river habitat availability (water depth) and resulting exposure

The following article has lots of great tips that will help you become a better fisherman. Continue on for some helpful tips that will show you to catch more fish than even you thought possible.
Be careful when wading through water. Whenever wading in a river, make sure to walk carefully and safely. Sound travels a long distance under water, so be sure you don’t scare fish away with too much noise. Take your time as you walk, and try leave the river bed as undisturbed as possible.
Try and make sure that your floor surface is dry when you go out fishing on a boat. Since you have fishing rods with sharp hooks dangling from their tips, you definitely do not want to slip or trip due to wet flooring. Prior to heading out on the water, use a towel or a mop to dry the floor.
One thing every fisherman should always remember is patience. Patience and dedication are requirements of fishing trips as there may be days at a time where you won’t get a bite. Don’t let yourself get frustrated, or you’ll just end up ruining your day.
To ensure safety on your fishing trip, check the weather. It is also good to bring along a radio to stay up-to-date in case there are any changes in the weather.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Thermocline fishing isn’t the easiest, but if you’re interested in making your time on the water more productive, you should learn what the heck a thermocline is, how it affects your fishing, and how to find it!
The thermocline is a layer of the water column. In that layer, the water temperature changes rapidly and dissolved oxygen levels can be finicky due to decomposition that occurs in every body of water.
In the late spring, the water column begins to stratify, warm water on the top, and cooler water down below. The layer in between the warm water and cold water is the thermocline.
How Does Thermocline Affect Fishing?
Knowing where the thermocline is in your lake can be incredibly beneficial! As the air temperatures rise during the summer time, the thermocline layer begins to lose more and more dissolved oxygen.
This is important because the water column below the thermocline won’t have any dissolved oxygen which is needed for fish to survive. Knowing that, we can call the layer below the thermocline a “dead zone” for any fish to be caught.
Fishing the thermocline becomes more and more important as we get deeper into summer. The best place to find fish, is in the area right above the thermocline layer. That layer will have the most concentrated amount of dissolved oxygen mixed with the cooler water.

Question: How can copper punch holes in a bacterium?
Every cell’s outer membrane, including that of a single cell organism like a bacterium, is characterized by a stable electrical micro-current. This is often called “trans-membrane potential”, and is, literally, a voltage difference between the inside and the outside of a cell. It is strongly suspected that when a bacterium comes in contact with a copper surface, a short circuiting of the current in the cell membrane can occur. This weakens the membrane and creates holes.
Another way to make a hole in a membrane is by localized oxidation or “rusting.” This happens when a single copper molecule, or copper ion, is released from the copper surface and hits a building block of the cell membrane (either a protein or a fatty acid). If the “hit” occurs in the presence of oxygen, we speak of “oxidative damage”, or “rust.” An analogy is rust weakening and making holes in a piece of metal.

To answer your question -- it depends on what you mean by "net carbs." There are many important reason to count carbohydrates, especially if one is trying to loose weight. That being said, any sophisticated diet change should be discussed with a trained professional.
I would recommend seeing a dietician in order to better understand this topic and healthy diet options. Carbs, or carbohydrates, are a fundamental food type. This is essentially a sugar, although not necessarily the sweet sugar we use in foods. These complex sugars include bread, pasta, vegetables and fruits as well. If you are thinking of this in the context of weight management, the real question is not carbs, but calories. While some diets (e.g. Atkins) focus on carbs, most medical doctors will say that this is less important. The real method to loose weight is to eat less CALORIES (a unit of energy) than one expends (by exercise). Each gram of carbohydrate has 3.75 calories. Counting carbs or calories can be done using the nutritional information on the side of a food. Online calculators for vegetables and fruits can also be found. Talk to a dietitian.

There is a reason why some fairy lights are more expensive than others. It simply comes down to quality. Quality of the solar panel, the light string itself, the batteries contained within, the quality of lighting time and any additional features that they may have.
How long do you want them to last: days, months or years?
How long do you need them to light each night?
Where are you planning to place them? Will they be exposed to high winds or animals?
How much sun exposure will they receive?
Size: Size does matter. More solar cells mean faster battery charging. Most solar lights discharge overnight and have to start from scratch each day to recharge their batteries. The panels should be designed to achieve a full charge over the course of a day, but this may entail 8-10 hours direct sunlight for smaller panels. Larger panels may only require 4-6 hours.
Resin Covered: Most solar fairy lights have resin covered panels for weather protection. These will gradually craze (become opaque) due to UV exposure and in some cases even lift from the battery pack. The more opaque the cover becomes, the less efficient the panel will be and consequently lighting time will be affected. Generally, this happens over a 3-6 month period.
Glass covered: A less common method of weather protection, but will not craze and will last considerably longer than their resin counterparts.

Losing sensation can be uncomfortable, making you feel a constant numbness or tingling in the damaged parts of your body. Fortunately, if caught early enough, you can address the numbness and tingling through treatments like the Neuremedy supplement or through the non-invasive MicroVas thereapy, available in our Houston podiatry practice, that increases blood circulation in the feet and legs to help alleviate the discomfort of neuropathy.
Unfortunately, this lack of feeling is isn’t just uncomfortable—it can also be dangerous. If you are not able to feel a cut or sore on your foot, you may leave it unclean and untreated—and that leaves the cut open and vulnerable to infections. Nerve damage can also affect the muscles in your feet, meaning some may work while others slack off or work less efficiently. If this happens, your foot alignment could be impacted, meaning some areas of your foot are subjected to more pressure than they are meant to handle. Left unchecked, this pressure can build up over time and lead to diabetic foot wounds.
Not only are foot wounds harder for diabetics to notice, they also take longer to heal because your feet are getting less blood flow, making it difficult for your body to generate new, healthy cells. Basically, once it

Dietary oxalates may compound already existing problems with oxalate breakdown due to gene mutations (hyperoxalurias), gut dysbiosis or nutritional deficiencies. It is beneficial to follow a low oxalate diet in the presence of high urinary oxalates to reduce symptoms and extra load on the body as oxalates drive salt complex or crystal formation. Use this as a temporary measure whilst addressing the underlying biochemical or gut issues.

When you pass an electric current through a solution, ions (charged particles) migrate towards the electrode of the opposite charge.

The carbohydrates we eat get broken down into glucose, which is essential to life. Once glucose enters the bloodstream, the hormone insulin is primarily responsible for transporting glucose into the cells where it is used for energy. Glucose is the preferred fuel source for the brain and central nervous system.
Carbohydrates encompass a wide variety of foods including vegetables, fruits, grains, beans and legumes, pastas, breads, cereals, sugar etc. Looking at that list, it’s probably obvious that some of these foods will affect your body differently than others. The rate at which carbs are digested and absorbed influences body composition and health.
Refined carbohydrates such as sugar, pastas, potatoes, bread, and processed grains like packaged oats and white rice are broken down very quickly, and cause blood glucose (aka blood sugar) levels to spike fast. This is important to understand because your body prefers blood sugar levels to remain relatively stable. If excess glucose is present, the muscles and the liver are able to store some of it for later use. However, when this storage is full, additional glucose can be transformed into body fat. In addition, diets high in these types of refined carbs can lead to higher blood triglyceride levels, higher LDL cholesterol levels, and increased insulin resistance.

Ever stepped foot in a kitchen? You likely already have a good grasp on which cookware pieces are best suited for certain jobs. While your kitchen might not be equipped with both a stock pot and a Dutch oven, it’s unlikely that you’d try to cook spaghetti in a sauté pan.
But what about knowing which pot or pan is right for a specific job? Or, equally important, which materials can’t handle the ingredients on hand?
Before we dig into the details, let’s explored why different types of cookware materials are best suited for certain foods.
There are lots of reasons why we cook, beyond killing bacteria and making it safe for consumption. Cooking can improve the texture of tough chunks of meat, change the color of ingredients, help improve their flavor and aroma, or make cruciferous vegetables easier to digest.
Each is the result of a chemical reaction caused by heat energy, which is transferred from your stovetop to your ingredients using different kinds of cookware.
Simple enough, right? Sure, until you realize that the cookware’s material also reacts with heat – and each material behaves differently.
With this in mind, conductivity and reactivity are the two primary factors that affect how well each cookware material can get the job done. Let’s take a closer look.

Metals that do not distribute heat evenly causes hot spots and will burn foods. The most important thing to think about when you buy gourmet cookware is the type and thickness (known as the gauge) of the material used.
Copper is an excellent conductor: It heats quickly and evenly and cools quickly. Copper is extremely expensive, heavy, and involves a great deal of care. Copper may react with some foods, so it usually has a tin lining, which is soft and easily scratched. Because of these problems, copper is often layered with stainless steel or aluminum in the bottom of pots and pans.
Aluminum is the most commonly used in commercial utensils. It is lightweight, and after copper, conducts heat the best. Aluminum is a soft metal, so it should be treated with care.

Interruptions to daily activities as well as other social disruptions caused by excess sweat are a common result of this condition.

In generalized hyperhidrosis (also known as secondary hyperhidrosis), excessive sweating occurs over the entire body. It is often caused by a medical condition such as an infection, a chronic disease, or a disorder that disrupts the body's natural balance of hormones.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

If you notice that you sweat more than your family and friends, you keep topping up your deodorant throughout the day, or find them next to useless as an anti-perspirant, and end up changing your clothes several times a day as well; then you may suffer from excessive sweating.
Hyperhidrosis is the medical term used when diagnosing the condition of excessive sweating.
It is estimated that hyperhidrosis affects around 3% of the global population. It can affect both men and women, often starting after puberty or in adolescence, and commonly manifests on the hands, feet, face and under the arms known as the axillary area. This is the area that mostly bothers people when they sweat too much as it’s often very noticeable – sweat marks on your clothes, issues with body odour and a constant feeling of wetness, all of which can be socially crippling.
Those diagnosed as hyperhidrotic don’t even need the type of environments that many of us, without the condition, require in order to get hot and sweaty; it’s just something that happens all the time. So, being in situations such as crowded places, public transport, hot offices or even with heighted anxiety such as when you are placed in stressful work or social situations mean that the symptoms of hyperhidrosis can be ten times worse for a sufferer. All of this can be a real downer on a person’s confidence and limit their

What Is MiraDry and How Can It Help With Excessive Sweating?
No one wants to deal with excessive sweating. From embarrassing clothing stains to the unpleasant odor, this problem can affect a person’s confidence, relationship, and even career. For some people, even clinical-strength antiperspirants offer no relief. Luckily, The Dermatologist Clinic can help. We provide MiraDry, a device that is used for permanent sweat treatment.
MiraDry is a specialized handheld device used to treat axillary hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating in the underarms. This groundbreaking, FDA-approved treatment was developed by Miramar Labs in Sunnyvale, California. MiraDry works as a sweat treatment by eliminating the glands beneath the arms. Most patients will notice a reduction in underarm odor, since the odor is produced by the sweat glands. Many people also report a reduction in unsightly underarm hair.
A dermatologist uses MiraDry to safely and precisely apply noninvasive microwaves to the patient. MiraDry is made to specifically target the underarm region. The microwaves target the area where sweat glands are located. The sweat glands are then rendered nonfunctional through thermolysis, and since they are not thought to grow back, the procedure should be permanent. Since these same glands produce underarm odor, both excessive sweating and foul-smelling sweat can be treated with the same procedure.
Although many patients see results after only one sweat treatment, at The Dermatology Clinic, we recommend two treatments a few months apart for maximum results. The dermatologist will determine the appropriate length of time between

Why do I need to know MY sweat rate?
Everyone sweats differently. Genetics, gender, training, and acclimatization all affect your sweat rate. In addition, the harder you work, the more you sweat. The hotter it is, the more you sweat.

If you weigh yourself before and after your exercise, the difference in weight is primarily due to sweat loss. Convert that to fluid volume and you have sweat loss (1kg = 1L).

When sweating is not associated with exercise or heat, it is called hyperhidrosis. While frustrating, the condition is treatable.
So how do I know if I have hyperhidrosis?
If sweating affects your ability to perform normal activities, such as turn a doorknob or walk comfortably, you may have hyperhidrosis.
Typically, patients with hyperhidrosis visibly sweat even when they are not exerting themselves. Visible sweating may appear as sweat-soaked clothing or in beads of sweat on the forehead or other parts of the face.
Hyperhidrosis can often trigger skin problems such as bacteria or fungal infection. Excessive sweating can also cause skin to become soft and white or even peel in certain areas.
Am I at a high risk for hyperhidrosis?
But why am I sweating so much?
The most common form of excessive sweating, primary hyperhidrosis occurs when the sweat glands produce sweat even when they haven’t been triggered. This condition has no known medical cause, though it may have a genetic component.
With secondary hyperhidrosis, excessive sweating is caused by a medical condition or medication and can affect your entire body. A variety of health issues can lead to hyperhidrosis, including infections, gout, and menopause.
Is there anything I can do to prevent excessive sweating?
Switching to an antiperspirant can help limit visible sweating. However, while deodorants limit the smell of sweat, they do not actually stop you from perspiring.
Certain materials are more breathable than others. Fabrics with looser weaves, such as linens, are cooler than those with tight weaves, like silk.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Before refrigeration, ice was harvested from lakes in the winter, stored in ice houses and them brought out in the summer. In 1890, The Massachusetts Department of Public Health studied the quality of melt water from clear lake ice, and discovered that it was safe to drink even if the lake itself was polluted. This is because the directional freezing that occurs on the surface of a lake - the same principle that creates ClearlyFrozen ice - pushes not only the cloud of dissolved air, but also everything else in the lake water downward, even reducing the bacteria count by up to 99%!
We tested this by mixing up a batch of dark green food coloring in water, and freezing it in a regular ice cube tray and a ClearlyFrozen ice cube tray. In the regular tray, the food coloring had no place to go, so the cubes (on the sides) came out dark green. In the ClearlyFrozen tray, not only the cloud, but also the the food coloring was forced downward, and largely eliminated from the cubes (center).

Courtesy The Burlap Bag Fitness trends come and go. Wardrobes change with the seasons. As for beverages, one thing stays constant all year long: There’s never a bad time to drink iced coffee.
However, there are bad ways to make iced coffee, like using regular ice cubes. You know what they do to your drink, how they water it down and turn it into coffee-flavored water. No one wants that. We deserve more from our beverages.
Luckily, you can save yourself from this unfortunate experience with one easy solution: coffee ice cubes, like the ones made by our friends at The Burlap Bag. Simply pour leftover coffee (or a fresh pot, your choice) into an ice cube tray and let it sit in the freezer for 3-4 hours. You’ll probably want a tray specifically for coffee cubes so your actual ice cubes don’t taste like java.
Add those to your cup of iced coffee, and as they melt, your drink stays rich sans the extra, unwelcome water.

In American football, the winner of the coin toss can make a choice now (usually to receive the kick-off which starts the game), or can defer their choice to the second half (thus having the option to receive the kick-off in the second half).
Suppose there were two evenly matched teams, and the halftime score were 17-16. Before evaluating their chances, I would want to know (at least) one more thing.
If the 17-point team had deferred, and was now receiving the ball in the third quarter, I would consider it ahead, both on points and on the "deferred" reception.
But suppose this right belonged to the 16-pointer. Would the deferred reception give them the better chance of winning?
The value of this could be no more than a touchdown, and probably a lot less. It may not even be the value of a field goal.
Are there any estimates or quantifications of the deferred reception privilege, and the "extra" possession privilege that it confers?

We live in a generation where we are constantly trying to juggle many things at the same time resulting in stress and anxiety. This is why most people fidget and twitch when they are faced with tasks that require mental focus. Nervousness in tense situations also elevates fidgeting and makes it an uphill task to perform optimally. This has led to the invention of a range of products to tackle nervousness and the inability to focus. Fidget cubes are among the most popular products in this category.

This article summarizes a discussion I led among software executives that focused on creating an ideal software development environment.
Discussion participants’ physical environments vary considerably. Cubicle farms are most common. Some have semi-private (i.e., 2-person) offices. One had separators in a “funky” space. Our discussion about cubicles vs. private offices demonstrated a strong division of opinions.
In cube environments developers can get needed flow time by establishing a convention that indicates “do not interrupt.” Some organizations reported developers who put rows of paper clips across their cube doors; some reported “caution” tape. A near universal convention is that developers in cube environments use stereo headphones to mean “don’t interrupt.” Headphones off means “OK to interrupt.” One company reported giving each staff member a pair of Bose headphones. It’s also commonly reported that in many cases the developers don’t listen to anything through the headphones – they are simply a way to block out distractions.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

You can actually adjust that with the loft sleeve. If you adjust the loft to the highest setting, it will close the face. If you want it to look even more shut, you can jump to the highest setting and increase loft as well.
Thanks Allan, but, I am confused for two reasons. If I adjust the loft to a higher setting, I would increase the loft, right? Suppose I want to keep the loft as is but square the face (make it not open to the target).? Second, if I adjust the loft to a higher setting (say 10.5 to 11.0) will this actually make it more open?
As you surmised, The loft sleeve affects loft by altering face angle. When you move the sleeve toward the higher setting, you're closing the face at address. The increase in loft happens if your face angle at impact is the same as it would have been with the loft sleeve in standard. In other words, if you're able to get the face open at impact relative to the face angle at address, you will have added loft.

Recently, the final 20 possible landing spots for Amazon's second headquarters were released, and 3 of those locations are in the DMV (DC, Maryland, and Virginia). Northern Virginia, Washington DC, and Montgomery County were all notified that they would remain in the running. With 3 of the final 20 spots being located here, there is a decent possibility of the HQ2 landing in DMV. In fact, Jeff Bezos owns the biggest house in DC so why not keep a close eye on your team! Let's take a look at how this could change the real estate industry as Amazon is promising to bring over $5 billion of investments, and over 50,000 high paying jobs to whichever location wins the bid.
Obviously, there is not currently 50,000 homes and apartments that are available for people who would potentially be moving into the DMV area. Data from MarketStats-by ShowingTime, suggests that listings are continuing to decline each year, and have dropped about 13 percent from where they were last April. It seems that there is already beginning to be a shortage of available properties in this area even before the possibility of HQ2 moving to the area. This will call for more houses to be built in order to sustain the expected rapid increase in population.

Certified LEED Gold and built at the base of a LEED certified condominium high rise, the new community addition will certainly be a source of pride for area residents. The new library boasts the use of recycled materials, lots of high tech computer gadgetry to keep up with the times, and books, of course.
The new library was designed by 1100 Architects, and is located at the base of the Riverhouse, a luxury condominium high rise surrounded by green space at Rockefeller Park. Bao Ong of the NYTimes toured the library and reports that the 2-story building features “wood floors constructed from window frame scraps, old truck tires laid out as carpet, and a terrazzo staircase made of recycled glass and mirrors.” A large touch screen computer at the base of the stairs will show patrons how much energy and water is being consumed by the library. At a cost of $6.7 million, the library also includes 10 laptop computers for patrons to check out for use inside the library.

It’s a tricky one to answer. There was a jump in confidence among both consumers and businesses post-election, and the stock market finished 2016 strong. Both of those bode well, and in general terms, the housing recovery is expected to continue. But there’s just not enough information on Trump’s policies to make a more definitive call yet, according to Fannie Mae’s latest Economic and Housing Outlook. That uncertainty led the GSE to be conservative in its projections for the year.
According to Fannie Mae, “limited information on the new Administration’s potential economic policies” led the GSE to adopt a conservative projection of 2% economic growth this year. Fannie predicts that mortgage rates will rise gradually in 2017, eventually hitting a fourth-quarter average of 4.3%.
“There is risk that rates could rise faster and higher than forecasted, but the impact on housing could be offset by strengthened income growth,” Fannie Mae reported.
Despite the uncertainty, the housing market will most likely continue its recovery, Duncan said.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Its official: Voters in Denver will go to the polls in May to decide whether to allow residents to use and possess magic mushrooms and psilocybin, the hallucinogenic substance that makes those mushrooms so magic, without fear of criminal penalty. The city’s Election Division confirmed last Friday that an initiative petition to decriminalize the mushrooms had received enough signatures to qualify for the May 7 municipal ballot.
The group behind the initiative, Decriminalize Denver, wants to make the use and possession of psilocybin mushrooms by people 21 and over the city’s “lowest law enforcement priority.” The initiative would also prevent the city from using its resources to punish adults who are caught using or possessing the mushrooms.

Don’t believe me? I offer for your consideration these quotes from the various movies.
“You … form a symbiont circle. What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this.” (Episode I, 1999) What we do to the land, we do to ourselves. Whether we support or destroy it, our actions will determine our future.
“The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.” (Episode II, 2002) And in 2015, we saw democracy work in a big way. Not only did Congress make permanent a key tax incentive, but multiple ballot measures funding local land conservation passed.
“When 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not.” (Episode VI, 1983) Land that’s not conserved is land that could meet any fate. Conservation’s promise of permanency means the spaces we set aside today should look just as good nine centuries hence.
“I didn’t know there was so much green in the whole galaxy.” (Episode VII, 2015) A character is positively flabbergasted when she leaves her desert world to visit a lush, green planet. We’ve heard similar reactions from city kids during their first visit to conserved land.

The grill is the perfect piece of equipment for cooking mushrooms. Because mushrooms contain a high percentage of water they can remain moist under high, direct heat. As mushrooms lose moisture, the flavor of the mushroom (and anything you have added to them) is intensified.
The trick with mushrooms is knowing the best cooking method for the mushroom size and how to add flavor as you grill them.
You can grill mushrooms of any size, but you will need to use different equipment and cooking methods based on the size of the mushroom you are cooking. Mushrooms can lose as much as 50 percent of their size as they cook, so this must be taken into account when you choose your cooking method.
You can cook larger mushrooms directly on the grates of the grill, taking into account how much they are likely to shrink. For example, large portabello mushrooms can be grilled on the grates as it if they were hamburger patties (and they make a good hamburger substitute).
Medium to small mushrooms can be threaded onto skewers, which makes them easy to control on the grill. Basting or brushing with olive oil will help keep them from sticking to the grill. You will need to turn them to ensure all sides cook evenly.
Smaller mushrooms or those with tender caps that won't thread easily can be grilled using a grilling basket. Sliced mushrooms or smaller mushrooms may also be grilled in foil packets. Include some olive oil and seasonings.

It contains all the necessary components to grow several crops of mushrooms over an 8 to 10 week period of time. The mushroom compost has already been prepared and inoculated with the white colored mushroom mycelium (A moldy looking fungus) at the mushroom farm. All you need to do is follow the instructions below and you should have weeks of fun and enjoyment as you harvest one mushroom after another.
Depending on the mushroom variety, the first of the mushrooms are ready to be picked within 3 to 5 weeks after starting the mushroom growing kit. Generally the first crop of mushrooms is the largest, consisting of 35 to 60% of the fruiting mushrooms. Each crop thereafter usually becomes smaller; fruiting fewer and fewer mushrooms, until the kit stops. The mushroom crop fruits at intervals of approximately 10 to 30 days, temperature and variety of mushroom will cause this to vary somewhat. Mushrooms fruit faster at warmer temperature and slower at cooler temperatures. Mushrooms fruit at temperatures between 60 to 74 degrees F. The best quality and quantity of mushrooms are grown between the temperatures of 63 to 68 degrees F. Constant temperatures higher than 74 degrees usually prevent mushrooms from growing, and temperatures over 86 degrees for several hours can kill the mushroom mycelium (the fungus).

Unlike birds and pterosaurs, in which the wing is supported by the bones of the arm and one finger, a bat's wing membrane, or patagium, is supported by the arm and by four highly elongated fingers (hence the name Chiroptera, or "hand-wing," for the bats). The patagium extends all the way around to the bat's hind legs and tail, where it forms a flap called the uropatagium, supported by specialized foot bones called calcars. Not only does the uropatagium help the bat fly and maneuver, it is often used to sweep prey, such as insects on the wing, into the bat's mouth while the bat is in flight.

Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating.

Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

The only metric for converting a spectral audio graph into a decibel measurement that denotes species-specific noise level is the dBht (Species) metric described in Nedwell et al 2007. This metric is useful for understanding the effects of loud sounds on organisms because it translates any sound spectrum into a level humans can identify with.
Both humans and other organisms avoid loud sounds because extended exposure can cause permanent hearing damage. The following sound levels cause behavior altering effects.
This species-sensitive metric has its weaknesses. Though loudness is one acoustic effect that could affect the behavior of a marine animal, these organisms also flee when exposed to sounds they perceive as a threat, regardless of the sound level. Though anthropogenic sounds rarely simulate the sounds of a predator, incidental biomimicry does occur. For example, some fish are thought to flee from high frequency sonar because they perceive the sound to be dolphin echolocation clicks. In these cases, an organism’s behavior could be affected at a sound level below the 75 dBht, the threshold for sound avoidance due to loudness.

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure. Similar to the effect of music therapy, some researches have suggested that the sounds dolphins emit through their whistles and clicks help produce these changes.
Echolocation is claimed to affect brain wave pattern and human tissue. Echolocation is a technique on which dolphins

Rapid buzz is "third reason why they've been successful evolutionarily."
Holy bat buzz, Batman—a new study shows the night flyers are the first known mammals with superfast muscles.
Found in some songbirds and snakes, superfast muscles in bats occur in the throat and enable a crucial hunting behavior: echolocation, in which the bat sends out sound waves and listens for echoes bouncing off prey.
As a bat closes in on an insect, the mammal emits more than 160 calls a second, a phenomenon called terminal buzz.
The discovery explains how bats release such rapid calls. "It's really cool, because the muscles belong to this rare group, superfast muscles," said study leader Coen Elemans, a biologist at the University of Southern Denmark.
But "at the same time, they also limit the bats."
Though fast, the specialized muscles allow only a finite number of calls per second, Elemans pointed out. With even faster muscles, bats would benefit by making more calls per second, since each sound wave gives them more information about prey.
For the study, Elemans and colleague released individuals of a species called Daubenton's bats in a large cage, where they flew toward mealworms that the researchers had hung on a string. The bats' echolocation calls were recorded with a sophisticated microphone array.
The scientists measured when the bats were issuing calls, as well as when the echoes of those calls reached the bats' ears.

Increasingly acidic seawater causes oyster shells to weaken, which doesn't bode well for the pearls forming within. But, as scientists report in ACS' journal Environmental Science & Technology, the mollusks might be more resilient to changing conditions than previously thought.
Pearl aquaculture is big business, particularly in Asia and Australia. But much of it takes place in oceans, which are susceptible to the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide human activity releases into the atmosphere. CO2 from the air gets absorbed by the oceans, which become more acidic as a result. Research has found that pearl oysters produce weaker shells under these conditions, and this could hurt their chances of survival. But in addition to acidity, rising water temperature could also play a role in oyster health. Rongqing Zhang, Liping Xie and colleagues wanted to see how combining acidity and water temperature would affect pearl oysters.
The researchers tested oysters for two months under varying water temperature and pH conditions, including those predicted for oceans in 2100. Their results confirmed previous work that had found boosting acidity led to weaker shells, but that effect didn't occur when the water temperature was also higher. The researchers concluded that warmer oceans could buffer these valuable marine animals from increasingly acidic seawater.

Recent research suggests a link between osteoporosis and bone loss in the jaw. When bone loss in the jaw occurs, teeth that are usually supported and anchored by the jawbone may become loose; tooth loss may occur.
Osteoporosis means “porous bone.” Normal human bone looks like a honeycomb, but bones affected by osteoporosis have holes and spaces that are much bigger. This means the bones have lost density or mass. As bones become less dense, they become weaker and more brittle making the simplest chores like picking up a newspaper potentially hazardous. Something like picking up a child or even sneezing could cause a break.
Bones are living tissue and are constantly being absorbed and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the body cannot create new bone quickly enough to keep up with the removal of old bone. Osteoporosis can affect any bone in the human body, including the jawbone. It can occur in men and women, but it most often occurs in Caucasian women over the age of 65.
How does Osteoporosis Affect my Oral Health?

My current research focus is on understanding the effects of man-made sounds on the social behaviour of cetaceans. Most marine mammals are highly social species. They live in groups and to a large extent depend on group members for foraging, protection from predators, access to females and alloparental care. Social behaviour can therefore be a strong driver of population health. Sound is of fundamental importance for many aspects of cetacean behaviour and ecology. Many species rely on echolocation to find prey, and on vocalisations and hearing for communication with conspecifics. Man-made noise can have severe effects on various aspects of these behaviours, ranging from the masking of sounds to, in the extreme case, strandings. These interferences can negatively affect survival and reproductive success. I investigate sound effects on cetacean behaviour within the larger framework of Behavioural Response Studies, international, multidisciplinary research projects which aim to study the effect of naval sonar on cetacean behaviour.

The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain. These retinal nerve cells need a constant supply of blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients.
When the flow of blood from the retina is blocked, the retinal nerve cells can die and vision may be lost. Because all of the blood from the retina drains through one large vein, a blockage of that vein can affect all the vision in that eye.
Why do people get retinal vein occlusion?
RVO is the second most common retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy. It happens when a blood clot blocks the vein. Sometimes it happens because the veins of the eye are too narrow.
It is more likely to occur in people with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, or other health problems that affect blood flow.
Management of underlying medical conditions and cardiovascular risk factors is important in the treatment of RVO.
How does the doctor know whether someone has a retinal vein occlusion?
The symptoms of RVO range from subtle to very obvious. There is painless blurring or loss of vision. It almost always happens in just one eye.

The more you smoke, the higher the chance that you’ll start to snore. It’s recommended that if you can’t cut down completely, you have your last cigarette roughly 4 hours before you go to bed. This will give the irritation time to settle down.
If you’re overeating and not doing enough exercise, you’ll start to gain weight. This includes an increase in the amount of fat around the neck. The more pressure there is against the throat, the less your muscles will be able to keep the airways open. This is when snoring occurs.

Applying a rebalance update doesn't affect your total returns. Your total returns before and after rebalance remains the same. Let’s understand it with a very simple example.
Suppose you invested Rs 100 in Stock A. After 3 months the value of your investment increased to Rs 120. This is how your P&L summary will look.
Now you decide to sell Stock A and Buy Stock B. You will get Rs 120 when you sell Stock A. At this point Rs 20 moves from your current returns to realized returns. But the the total return which is the summation of realized and current returns, remains the same. This is how your performance summary will look like once you complete the transaction.

Because it exists in a delicate balance with estrogen, it can cause several problems when your hormones go haywire. Many times, women face lower levels of all hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But what happens when levels of this hormone become too high? Keep reading to find out how to recognize high progesterone levels and how to treat them.
What Causes High Progesterone Levels?
Naturally, women should experience increased levels of progesterone during ovulation and pregnancy. However, when many middle aged women reach menopause, their reproductive years are part of the past. During menopause, high progesterone levels are usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This occurs when there is a drastic drop in estrogen production, causing progesterone dominance. High progesterone levels can also be the result of sedentary life and an imbalanced diet.
What Are the Symptoms of High Progesterone?
Increased progesterone levels often have signs and symptoms such as muscle fatigue, drowsiness, and mood swings. In addition, this condition can affect your sexual health by causing vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Emotionally, you may be more prone to anxiety and depression.
Other less common symptoms of high progesterone can affect your physical appearance. In excessive amounts, this hormone can cause oily skin, acne, and weight gain. It can also affect your excretory system, causing urinary tract infections and incontinence.
How Can I Treat Progesterone Imbalance?

The climate is the change in meteorological variables such as a change in the temperature, the amount of precipitation that we get, or even the amount of wind that occurs in an area. It is also considered to be the weather averaged over time.
Most people’s understanding of an earthquake is that it is when the ground begins to suddenly shake. This occurs very rapidly and can cause a lot of destruction in a short amount of time. If they occur in a residential or commercial area, they can cause tremendous damage to homes, bridges and buildings. They are responsible for about 15,000 deaths each year. They can also cause landslides and in some areas have been known to cause volcano’s to erupt.
An earthquake can also cause fires due to downed power lines or damaged gas lines. In this event it can be hard to keep some fires under control. If the earthquake occurs close to a river dams can also be damaged and extensive flooding can occur. Massive earthquakes, where they occur out in the ocean, can also cause Tsunami’s. They can travel hundreds of miles in the ocean and when they reach the shore line they are known to cause excessive destruction.

What are the player Ratings?
How does weather affect the game?
How does the Stamina Rating and fatigue work?
There are Stamina Ratings for passing, receiving, and rushing. The higher the ratings, the better. These Stamina Ratings determine how much the player can play. For instance, the Pass Stamina Rating determines how many passes a QB can pass in a game, while the Rush Stamina Rating determines how many carries a player can make. If a player is playing more than his Stamina Rating allows, then his performance will begin to drop. This means it is important to draft a team with enough stamina in each category to get you through the season.
Other than the Stamina Ratings, the other thing that affects performance during the game is fatigue. Fatigue only occurs within each game and is accumulated as the player plays. The bigger the play, the more fatigued he will be. Fatigue is recovered by sitting out some plays. Fatigue is not accumulated over the season, so if a player is fatigued in one game, he will be refreshed for the next game.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Hyperplasia happens when there’s an increase in the number of cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast.
When hyperplasia occurs in the ducts it’s called ductal hyperplasia. Ductal hyperplasia can be either ‘usual’ or ‘atypical’.
When hyperplasia occurs in the lobules it’s called atypical lobular hyperplasia.
Atypical hyperplasia is when cells lining the ducts or lobules increase in number and also develop an unusual pattern or shape. ‘Atypical’ means ‘not typical’.
Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) occurs in the ducts; atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) occurs in the lobules.
Atypical hyperplasia is benign (not cancer). However, having atypical hyperplasia has been shown to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in some people.
Hyperplasia usually develops naturally as the breast changes with age. It’s more common in women over 35, but can affect women of any age.
Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia can also affect men, but this is very rare.

Here are the most common causes of pulling and how to fix them.
The most common source of pulling is wheel misalignment. You see, a vehicle’s wheels and axels create a rectangle, at a right angle to the road and parallel to each other. If these distinct positions get skewed, the car pulls to one side.
Whether pulling begins gradually or starts after hitting an especially deep pothole, driving conditions can affect wheel alignment. For this reason, you should have it regularly checked by professionals. They will line up wheels and axels to correct this rectangle and adjust the suspension angles that affect wheel position.
*Tip – Most mechanics recommend having wheels aligned each time tires get switched out for the season.
Tire pressure fluctuates while driving and can cause imbalance, with one tire having less pressure than the others. This issue can create pulling, so you should always check tire pressure (adding more, if needed) straight away if a car starts to pull. If pulling continues after this check, you might have a bigger problem and should call a professional.
Tire Conicity happens when a defective tire is made. For example, sometimes a mistake during manufacturing causes the rubber to harden into a cone shape instead of the usual cylinder. This mistake will make the car

How much would it cost to end homelessness in the United States? About as much as we spend on Christmas decorations every year.
According to the latest report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the national homeless population held pretty much steady from 2011 to 2012, which is good or bad, depending on how you look at it.
What's needed to turn things around, says Mark Johnston, acting assistant housing secretary for community planning and development, is money -- big money. Nearly $2 billion a year worth of big money.
As it happens, that's about the same amount Americans spend annually on Christmas decorations and flowers. Or so says the advocacy group ThinkProgress.
There will be some, I suppose, who will view this as a declaration of war on Christmas (a battle our friends at Fox News seem willing to wage every year at this time).
In response, it's worth noting that the guy whose birthday we're supposedly celebrating built his ministry out of helping the downtrodden and less fortunate.
So it's perhaps fair to ask the old question: What would Jesus do?
I'm guessing he'd go easy on the tinsel and focus more on the good deeds.

There are so many things that could be causing you to snore. Before you look into the different treatments available, it helps to know exactly what is causing the problem.
Everybody is different and what causes one person to snore might not be the cause of the next person’s snoring. Therefore it’s vital that you visit your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to see where the problem lies.
Sometimes it could be a mixture of the above that’s causing you to snore.
When you smoke, it tends to irritate the lining within the nasal cavities. It can also cause the throat to swell up. Once this happens the airflow is restricted and that leads to snoring. The more you smoke, the higher the chance that you’ll start to snore. It’s recommended that if you can’t cut down completely, you have your last cigarette roughly 4 hours before you go to bed. This will give the irritation time to settle down.
If you’re overeating and not doing enough exercise, you’ll start to gain weight. This includes an increase in the amount of fat around the neck. The more pressure there is against the throat, the less your muscles will be able to keep the airways open. This is when snoring occurs.

Because it exists in a delicate balance with estrogen, it can cause several problems when your hormones go haywire. Many times, women face lower levels of all hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But what happens when levels of this hormone become too high? Keep reading to find out how to recognize high progesterone levels and how to treat them.
What Causes High Progesterone Levels?
Naturally, women should experience increased levels of progesterone during ovulation and pregnancy. However, when many middle aged women reach menopause, their reproductive years are part of the past. During menopause, high progesterone levels are usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This occurs when there is a drastic drop in estrogen production, causing progesterone dominance. High progesterone levels can also be the result of sedentary life and an imbalanced diet.
What Are the Symptoms of High Progesterone?
Increased progesterone levels often have signs and symptoms such as muscle fatigue, drowsiness, and mood swings. In addition, this condition can affect your sexual health by causing vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Emotionally, you may be more prone to anxiety and depression.
Other less common symptoms of high progesterone can affect your physical appearance. In excessive amounts, this hormone can cause oily skin, acne, and weight gain. It can also affect your excretory system, causing urinary tract infections and incontinence.
How Can I Treat Progesterone Imbalance?

Most people’s understanding of an earthquake is that it is when the ground begins to suddenly shake. This occurs very rapidly and can cause a lot of destruction in a short amount of time. If they occur in a residential or commercial area, they can cause tremendous damage to homes, bridges and buildings. They are responsible for about 15,000 deaths each year. They can also cause landslides and in some areas have been known to cause volcano’s to erupt.
An earthquake can also cause fires due to downed power lines or damaged gas lines. In this event it can be hard to keep some fires under control. If the earthquake occurs close to a river dams can also be damaged and extensive flooding can occur. Massive earthquakes, where they occur out in the ocean, can also cause Tsunami’s.

How does the Stamina Rating and fatigue work?
There are Stamina Ratings for passing, receiving, and rushing. The higher the ratings, the better. These Stamina Ratings determine how much the player can play. For instance, the Pass Stamina Rating determines how many passes a QB can pass in a game, while the Rush Stamina Rating determines how many carries a player can make. If a player is playing more than his Stamina Rating allows, then his performance will begin to drop. This means it is important to draft a team with enough stamina in each category to get you through the season.
Other than the Stamina Ratings, the other thing that affects performance during the game is fatigue. Fatigue only occurs within each game and is accumulated as the player plays. The bigger the play, the more fatigued he will be. Fatigue is recovered by sitting out some plays.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing.

Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly.

Hyperplasia happens when there’s an increase in the number of cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast.
When hyperplasia occurs in the ducts it’s called ductal hyperplasia. Ductal hyperplasia can be either ‘usual’ or ‘atypical’.
When hyperplasia occurs in the lobules it’s called atypical lobular hyperplasia.
Atypical hyperplasia is when cells lining the ducts or lobules increase in number and also develop an unusual pattern or shape. ‘Atypical’ means ‘not typical’.
Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) occurs in the ducts; atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) occurs in the lobules.
Atypical hyperplasia is benign (not cancer). However, having atypical hyperplasia has been shown to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in some people.
Hyperplasia usually develops naturally as the breast changes with age. It’s more common in women over 35, but can affect women of any age.
Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia can also affect men, but this is very rare.
As hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia don’t usually cause any symptoms they’re usually found by chance when breast tissue that has been removed during a biopsy or breast surgery is examined under a microscope in the laboratory.

Here are the most common causes of pulling and how to fix them.
The most common source of pulling is wheel misalignment. You see, a vehicle’s wheels and axels create a rectangle, at a right angle to the road and parallel to each other. If these distinct positions get skewed, the car pulls to one side.
Whether pulling begins gradually or starts after hitting an especially deep pothole, driving conditions can affect wheel alignment. For this reason, you should have it regularly checked by professionals. They will line up wheels and axels to correct this rectangle and adjust the suspension angles that affect wheel position.
*Tip – Most mechanics recommend having wheels aligned each time tires get switched out for the season.
Tire pressure fluctuates while driving and can cause imbalance, with one tire having less pressure than the others.

However, regardless of why you are filing a claim, there are many legal terms thrown around by insurance companies and personal injury attorneys that you may not be familiar with. One of these terms is subrogation. If your attorney or the insurance company is using this word, you may have questions about it. Here are a few frequently asked questions about subrogation and the answers.
If you have never heard this term before, the first thing you may be wondering is what subrogation is. Subrogation is the term that insurance companies use when recouping money from an at-fault party. This can be an insurance company for the at-fault party or from the at-fault party personally. For example, if you were injured in a car accident, you may pay your deductible to your insurance company and in return, they will pay your policy limits. However, behind the scenes, they will subrogate your claim and recoup money from the other responsible party on your behalf. Subrogation also comes into play if there is more than one responsible party for your accident. For example, if you slip and fall on an icy sidewalk in front of a store, you may be able to hold the city responsible and the store owner responsible for your injuries, depending on the circumstances. In this case, the insurance

It is also used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure.
This medication works by making the body lose excess water and salt. Triamterene, called a potassium-sparing diuretic, helps the body to retain potassium, while hydrochlorothiazide causes potassium to be lost from the body. Therefore, potassium supplements are usually not required with this medication.

The dragonfly, after emerging from it larval stage and becoming a flying insect, has two objectives - to eat and to reproduce. They usually eat other small insects which they hunt and catch in mid-air. The regular technique for common darters is to perch on a prominent leaf or twig, and ambush its prey by rushing after it and catching it.
Male common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) on the lookout.
The other imperative is to reproduce. The male finds a suitable female and mates with her, forming the usual "mating wheel" in the process, so that the male can fertilise the female's eggs. The male grasps the female around the neck using his abdominal appendages; she swings her abdomen up and puts her eggs in contact with his sperm.
This coupling lasts up to quarter of an hour, after which the female lays her eggs - the process of ovipositing. She does this while still attached to the male.
What she does is fly over the surface and dip the end of her abdomen into the water, then bounce up again about a foot; this is repeated every few seconds. After a number of "dips" the pair will fly about for a little time then repeat the process. Sometimes she

There’s no denying that part of the reason children love mud is how it feels. Picking up the gooey substance with their hands, squelching the mud through their toes, mud provides a multitude of sensory experiences for children, which in turn stimulates the brain. Children today receive a lot less sensory stimulation compared to children from many years ago due to a variety of reasons. Children who lack necessary sensory experiences can develop sensory processing issues which can affect them in many ways. It is more important than ever that we give children plenty of experiences involving their senses – touch, smell, sight, taste, and hearing, as well as the two less-mentioned senses: vestibular (balance) and proprioceptive (sense of where each body part is in relation to the rest).
Aside from sensory benefits, mud also provides children with various other developmental benefits. Mud allows children to immerse themselves in their imaginations. To children, the mud can turn into anything! At Shaws Preschool, the mud kitchens allow children to engross themselves in pretend play. In one corner, children are whipping up a barbeque.

For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing.

It is the best of foods; it is the worst of foods. It’s been heralded as a super food once or twice, then scorned as a cholesterol-laden poison. So, what is truth and what is farce when it comes to the simple egg? Nature’s most simple meal, eggs have been eaten since the beginning of human history. Used in a huge variety of recipes as well as eaten alone, the egg is a rich source of protein and is very easy to obtain. Should you make eggs a regular part of your diet? It depends on whom you ask.
One large egg averages between 63-84 calories (sources vary widely). It contains 186- 213 mg of cholesterol (source vary here too) and approximately 6 grams of fat. Eating too much cholesterol will adversely affect your heart and may lead to high cholesterol levels and heart disease. One who suffers from high cholesterol may not want to eat a dozen eggs per week. According to Dr. Thomas Behrenbeck of the Mayo Clinic, eating four or fewer egg yolks weekly shouldn’t put you at an increased risk for heart disease (http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholesterol/HQ00608).
A healthy human should keep their daily dietary cholesterol intake to less than 300 milligrams. Someone with diabetes or heart disease should limit their cholesterol intake to less than 200 milligrams daily. One egg weighs in very close to that limit. So, if you have cholesterol problems or heart disease, it would be wise to limit your egg intake and be conscious of

The use of Trichogrammas against the textile moth (Tineola bisselliella) in Canada is relatively new and often raises many questions! In this article, we present this method of biological control and we answer the most frequently asked questions.
The textile moth is a small butterfly of the species Tineola bisselliella. The larva of this species can only complete its life cycle by feeding on animal fibers such as wool, hair and feathers.
The female prefers to lay its eggs in dark and quiet corners, close to animal matter, for example, wardrobes, storage rooms, chests, attics, etc. The whitish eggs measure 0.5 mm and are very difficult to observe on fabric. At birth, the small larva is about 1 mm long.
When temperatures are 25 to 30 Celsius, the larva completes its cycle in 2 months. At the end of its larval stage, it measures about 10 mm. With the animal material from which it feeds, it will create a small tubular form cocoon.

For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

How does coffee affect our teeth?
Coffee is an essential part of our Monday morning diet. More than 95% of Spanish adults drink coffee every day, making it one of our most popular drinks.
We often wonder: how does coffee affect our teeth? Is it harmful? Is it true that it makes them yellow or dark? We will try to resolve these issues.
Yes, coffee does stain our enamel. It is something that affects the aesthetics of our teeth: it darkens the enamel; it removes the shininess, and may even cause the appearance of spots. The vulnerability of our enamel is different in each of us. You will not necessarily have yellow teeth because of drinking coffee. The quality of our enamel depends both on our genetics, our diet and our hygiene habits. For example, a diet rich in calcium will make our teeth more resilient and healthy. Beyond aesthetics, coffee does not affect other areas, or produce oral diseases.
However, recommendations to prevent darkening our enamel are: brushing teeth after every meal, or, if we cannot, drinking a glass of water after drinking coffee. It is also advisable to chew sugarless gum or sugar-free sweet after coffee as this stimulates the production of saliva, which helps to clean our teeth.

The world of coffee brewing can be complex. Grind size, brew time, water temperature… there are many factors that can affect how your drink tastes. But it doesn’t have to be difficult. I’m going to explain the basics of brewing parameters so that you can make a magical coffee every single time.
Coffee brewing is a matter of science. Fortunately, once you understand one concept, everything becomes a lot easier.
While there are many things that affect a coffee’s flavour and aroma, nearly all of them converge in a single word: extraction.
According to Lani Kingston in How to Make Coffee: The Science Behind The Bean, coffee is approximately 30% soluble. And this 30% contains all the flavours and aromas that we want to taste in our cup of coffee. The only question is: how much of these do we want to taste?
You might also like What Do You Need to Brew Coffee at Home?
Coffee brewing is the process by which we extract these compounds. By controlling our brew method, we control the level of extraction. This is important because not all compounds are extracted at the same rate or point in extraction.
Earlier on in the brew, the fruitier and more acidic-tasting compounds are extracted. Then comes sweetness, and finally, the more bitter ones. In other words, if your coffee is tasting too sour (and it’s not because of the roast/beans), it’s probably under-extracted. Too bitter, over-extracted. Sweet, balanced, complex, and delicious?

I believe the lack of a nearby coffee shop where people can pop in for quick meetings reduces informal communication and relationship-building. That gap can be enormously important.
Likewise, another client farms out all of its legal work to a highly-respected law firm. There are benefits to that approach but, once again, the inconvenience factor arises. Managers who want to get a quick off-the-cuff legal opinion can't just walk down the hall or to another floor to chat with a lawyer co-worker.

There are different types of coffee grinders available for this purpose which are convenient for home use and also give the same results as you would get in a good coffee shop.

Basically there are three types, ones with steel blades, and the other two with burr blades of conical and flat shapes. Now how does all this affect the coffee taste?

Nevertheless, slips of action do occur. This study was designed to determine if slips of action can be induced in a well learned task and if so, how these slips affect specific indicators of task performance. Thirty (12 male) right-handed undergraduate participants were taught, with arrow cues, a sequence of dominant hand movements. Following this learning phase, a portion of the sequences were altered by either changing the spatial location of the arrow cue or by changing the actual movement goal. Results revealed that participants made numerous action slips which were most prevalent when the movement goal was altered. This suggests that participants were unable to disengage their expected movement plan and thus were vulnerable to errors. In addition to exploring the frequency of action slips we also looked at participants’ reaction and movement times on trials that preceded and followed errors and found that a speed-accuracy trade-off could not account for the slips. We also showed that frequency of slips on our task could reliably predict performance on the SART, a measure of inhibitory control, and the frequency of attention failures in daily living on the ARCES. Overall, the results of this study reveal that action slips can be induced by manipulating a well learned action routine and that the frequency of these induced slips reflects a participant’s tendency to commit action slips in everyday life.

If you know how to optimise and control these five factors, you’ll find it much easier to consistently brew your ideal coffee.
To be clear, these aren’t the only things that can affect the taste and consistency of a cup of coffee. As amateurs brewing coffee at home, however, we can focus on those that are likely to make the biggest difference.
Let’s take a closer look at each of the above factors.
One of the biggest factors affecting coffee taste is water composition. While you can’t control the water out of your tap, there are various filtration methods you can use to produce more consistent coffee.
The ideal water should have plenty of magnesium and low amounts of bicarbonate. This combination improves taste extraction while minimising minerals that destroy flavour. It also ensures that the “right” amounts of sugars, acids and other substances are extracted during the brewing process.
As a general rule, you should try to avoid hard water. Some coffee machines include built in filters to reduce water hardness, while for more basic machines you’ll need to filter the water before you use it.
This can be a hassle, but don’t overlook filtration. It can make a big difference to the final taste of your coffee.
Note: It’s important to understand that even with proper filtration it’s impossible

2. Choose the grind that matches the brew time. If you're not sure what coffee grind to use, just think about your chosen brewing method. The coffee grind size directly affects how much time the grounds are in contact with water. Espresso machines for example require very finely ground coffee. A rule of thumb; the finer the grind, the shorter the brew time.
3. Properly maintain & clean your coffee equipment. Make sure that your equipment is thoroughly cleaned after each use by rinsing it with clear, hot water and drying it with an absorbent towel. Check that no grounds have been left to collect on any part of the equipment and that there is no build up of coffee oil. Such residue can impart a bitter, rancid flavor to future cups of coffee.

THC is not affected by frost. However, the plant’s tissue can be damaged. Generally, temperatures below 45?F (7?C) affect the plant. Leaves suffer some damage and need to repair themselves before growth or ripening resumes. This may take a few days of good weather. When cold weather continues for several days the damage is compounded, weakening the plant and lowering its ability to repair itself.
In order to get back on the path towards maturity, the temperature must rise over 60?F (16?C), along with sunshine to provide energy for photosynthesis.
When temperatures slips down to 40?F (4?C), leaves, flowers and other plant parts suffer from extensive damage. It takes some time for a plant to recover from this damage, and it is unlikely to do so under normal fall conditions because cool weather is usually associated with cloudy skies. This limits the energy available to the plant so bud maturation and THC production is curtailed.

Although there are no hard and fast rules about how often you should update your will, certain life changes, such as a divorce, will trigger a need to do so.
But what happens if you divorce and die before you’ve had a chance to change your will? Does your estranged ex-spouse get the property you previously willed to him or her while you were still in love?
In Texas, the answer is no. The Texas statutes provide that if, after making a will, the testator’s marriage is dissolved, either by divorce, annulment or a declaration that the marriage is void, all the provisions in the will, including all fiduciary appointments, shall be read as if the former spouse predeceased the testator.
So if you previously signed a will that gave all your worldly possessions to your spouse, and named him or her as the executor of your will, but then divorced, those you named as contingent beneficiaries would take under the will, and those you named as alternate fiduciaries (executors or trustees) would be called on to act.
Nevertheless, it is important that you update your will after your divorce to reflect your current wishes. Your will is something that should change as your life does. Otherwise it can become an outdated document that doesn’t accomplish your goals or protect the loved-ones you leave behind.
Suppose you were married over 50 years and decided you want your ex-spouse to still inherit everything? Can you rewrite your will to that effect?

Retrieved Text: In biology, echolocation, or biosonar, is the physiological process of emitting sound waves and interpreting the echoes reflected back to the emitter in order to identify objects and determine their direction and distance. Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating.

Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure.

Applying a rebalance update doesn't affect your total returns. Your total returns before and after rebalance remains the same. Let’s understand it with a very simple example.
Suppose you invested Rs 100 in Stock A. After 3 months the value of your investment increased to Rs 120. This is how your P&L summary will look.
Now you decide to sell Stock A and Buy Stock B. You will get Rs 120 when you sell Stock A. At this point Rs 20 moves from your current returns to realized returns. But the the total return which is the summation of realized and current returns, remains the same. This is how your performance summary will look like once you complete the transaction.

James Daley talks you through what interest rates are, how they're set, what happens when they go up and down, and the effect they can have on us all individually.
For most of us, interest rates are the amount that we get paid by our bank for saving money, or the amount that we pay our bank to borrow money.
But when people talk about interest rates more broadly, they’re generally talking about the Bank of England base rate. The Bank of England is our central bank, and the base rate is the amount it charges our high street banks for saving their money every night. And the reason the Bank of England base rate is so important is because it’s the basis for all other banks to set their interest rates by.
Interest rates are set by a team of experts known as the Monetary Policy Committee. There are nine of them and they include the Governor of the Bank of England. They meet once a month to decide whether interest rates should go up, go down or stay the same. What influences that decision is what’s happening in the economy more generally, and more importantly what’s happening to inflation.
Inflation is the amount that prices are rising by, and the Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2% a year. If it misses that target by more or less than 1%, the Governor of the bank has to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain why.

Raising brace brings the arrow tip closer to center at brace, and at the moment it leaves the string. Lowering does the opposite. So within tight perameters, a softer spine will favor the lower brace, while the stiffer, the higher brace. Aside from fine tuning an arrow's flight, I know of no other effect brace height would have on accuracy.
Agree with wood. If it's too low, a lot too low, the arrow will likely bounce off the shelf at release. That wreaks havoc with accuracy. Too high, doesn't affect accuracy enough to matter. By accuracy, I'm just talking the effects of brace height on good arrow flight. In the end, accuracy rests with the skill of the shooter.
Basically what changing brace height does is detune the arrow if the bow and arrow were tuned to begin with.
With a lower brace height, the arrow stays on the string longer. So, any movement of the bow after you drop the string will effect the arrow. A lower brace height will have more arrow speed and a longer power stroke. A lower brace height will require a stiff we arrow, not a weaker arrow.

Yet, compared to studies of professional implementation, patient systems of implementation remain under-investigated. The aim of this paper is to explore the work, meaning and function attributed to ‘weaker’ ties relative to other more bonding relationships in order to identify the place of these within a context of systems of support for long-term conditions.
Methods: This is a mixed methods survey with nested qualitative study. A total of 300 people from deprived areas in the North West of England with chronic illnesses took part in a survey conducted in 2010 to 2011. A concentric circles diagram was used as a research tool with which participants identified 2,544 network members who contributed to illness management. Notions of ‘work’ were used to describe activities associated with chronic illness and to identify how weaker ties are included and perceived to be involved through social network members (SNM) contributions.
Results: The results provide an articulation of how SNMs are substantially involved in weak tie illness management. Weaker ties constituted 16.1% of network membership involved in illness work. The amount of work undertaken was similar but less than that of stronger ties. Weaker ties appeared more durable and less liable to loss over time than stronger ties. The qualitative accounts suggested that weak ties enabled the moral positioning of the self-managing ‘self’ and acted on the basis of a strong sense of reciprocity.

Retrieved Text: In biology, echolocation, or biosonar, is the physiological process of emitting sound waves and interpreting the echoes reflected back to the emitter in order to identify objects and determine their direction and distance. Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure. Similar to the effect of music therapy, some researches have suggested that the sounds dolphins emit through their whistles and clicks help produce these changes.

Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side.

Echolocation is the method that some bats use to catch insects and other moving creatures. They are able to use sound waves to determine where the insect is. When a bat is hunting it makes a series of high-pitched sounds. The sound waves travel through the air and bounce off of objects. When the sound waves return to the bat it can tell the bat where the object is. A bat can use sound waves to tell the difference between objects that are stationary or moving. For example, a bat uses sound waves to avoid hitting a tree and immediately afterwards uses sound waves to catch a mosquito. Bats probably have the best techniques for echolocation of any animal on earth. The sounds they make are often much higher than the human ear can hear.
How do sound waves travel back to a bat? It is similar to how a mirror reflects light. If you hold a small mirror in your hand and maneuver it in the sunlight you can see the light reflecting off of the mirror and onto other objects. This is similar to how sound waves are reflected. The bat emits a high-frequency sound. The sound waves hit an object and are then reflected back to the bat. This high-tech system allows bats to fly in total darkness. They not only see where they are going, but can also catch their prey. When you look at pictures of bats you can see that many have large ears and interesting nose

While this type of system is often more expensive to run, there are many different factors affecting its running costs. And, unlike their gas-powered cousins, electric systems can accommodate air conditioning installations using their existing blower motors and ductwork. This makes them a clear winner for homes located in areas with excessively hot summer temperatures.
When it comes to cost, an HVAC system's hardware is one of the leading factors in the cost of running it. Different manufacturers, models, and system sizes all utilize different amounts of energy. And some systems that are rated Energy Star compliant use less energy than systems that aren't.
The HVAC system's ductwork located under your house or in the attic space is responsible for moving around all of the heated or cooled air. Since the air can be cooled or warmed by the outdoor temperature, it must be well insulated and all of its connections must be sealed tight with duct tape.
The insulation in your home determines how much heat transfer happens between indoors and the outside. The more winter heat and summer cooling you lose to the outdoors, then the more your HVAC system will need to run to keep your family comfortable.

Increasingly acidic seawater causes oyster shells to weaken, which doesn't bode well for the pearls forming within. But, as scientists report in ACS' journal Environmental Science & Technology, the mollusks might be more resilient to changing conditions than previously thought.
Pearl aquaculture is big business, particularly in Asia and Australia. But much of it takes place in oceans, which are susceptible to the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide human activity releases into the atmosphere. CO2 from the air gets absorbed by the oceans, which become more acidic as a result. Research has found that pearl oysters produce weaker shells under these conditions, and this could hurt their chances of survival. But in addition to acidity, rising water temperature could also play a role in oyster health. Rongqing Zhang, Liping Xie and colleagues wanted to see how combining acidity and water temperature would affect pearl oysters.
The researchers tested oysters for two months under varying water temperature and pH conditions, including those predicted for oceans in 2100. Their results confirmed previous work that had found boosting acidity led to weaker shells, but that effect didn't occur when the water temperature was also higher. The researchers concluded that warmer oceans could buffer these valuable marine animals from increasingly acidic seawater.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing.

Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly.

I absolutely agree that noise pollution in our oceans is one of the most dangerous threats to cetaceans. Since cetaceans live in a world of sound, they rely on echolocation 100% of the time for absolutely everything – from navigation to feeding to predation avoidance. Because of this, their hearing is extremely sensitive. Extremely loud noises from humans – including sounds from the military training exercises – truly harm cetaceans in various ways and can cause death. Since sound travels much faster and farther underwater than through the air, cetaceans can detect noises very easily. Extremely loud sounds overwhelm cetaceans to a point where they’d become so stressed. Their behaviors and habits change as a result.

Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure. Similar to the effect of music therapy, some researches have suggested that the sounds dolphins emit through their whistles and clicks help produce these changes.

Calories in, calories out. If you have a calorie deficit, you're going to lose weight, if you consume extra calories, you'll gain body fat. While that's true, it's only part of the picture.

Therefore, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn even when you’re just sitting around. As your muscle mass drops, so does your daily calorie requirement.

The increasing complexity of homogenous and stratified fuelling, split injection delivery and variable valve timing geometry has placed critical responsibility on ignition performance. Often within the diagnostic process there is no serial evidence of an ignition problem, or that what evidence is available is incomplete especially at the early stages of failure.

The primary circuit bears the responsibility of energy creation with current profile as the focus of our measurement. The secondary circuit has the responsibility of delivery, our focus is burn time and slope profile.

Overweight people are at greater risk of developing a wide array of health complications than their normal-weight counterparts. These complications include hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis and fatty liver disease, according to the Weight-control Information Network. Candy and other empty calories are often blamed as the culprits for weight gain. However, fully understanding weight management and candy's role in your weight can arm you with the power you need to stay healthy.
In order to understand candy's impact on your weight, you must first understand the science of weight maintenance. Energy is measured in kilocalories, often referred to simply as calories. To maintain your current body weight, you must eat approximately the same amount of calories as you burn each day. Eating more calories than you burn each day results in weight gain, and eating fewer calories than you burn each day results in weight loss. Because a pound of fat equals 3,500 calories, according to the American Heart Association, eating approximately 500 calories per day less than you burn will result in a weight loss of about 1 pound per week.
Candy tends to be calorie-dense, providing little in the way of nutritional value. For example, a milk chocolate bar made with nougat and caramel contains 260 calories, 10 grams of fat and 35 grams of sugar.

Why Would I Get It?
In technical terms, this happens as a result of “non-uniform usage of pixels”.
Put simply, it will create a permanent image of some objects on the display –hence the term “ghost image”. It will also decrease the overall quality of the display and make it less operational.
Screen burn-in is particularly common in AMOLED displays. AMOLED – active-matrix organic light-emitting diode is a screen technology, used in most high-end phones, as well as TV displays. Thus, the problem of screen burn-in can equally affect televisions and some other devices.
Ah, yes – why can it happen?
Basically, leaving your screen active and idle for long periods of time can do the trick – that is when you don’t set for your screen to time-out when it’s not in use. Your screen produces images thanks to the phosphorous compounds which emit light. When used unevenly, the light output will also become uneven and cause what we have referred to as “burn-in”. In extreme cases, you may even see the shadow of previous content on the screen, no matter where you are on the phone.

However, the other three forces lose out in the competition with gravity over long distances. The weak and strong interactions both have an intrinsically short range. Electromagnetism, while being long-range like gravity, suffers from a cancellation of attraction and repulsion in bulk matter, since there tend to be as almost exactly as many positive as negative charges in any sizable piece of matter. In contrast, gravitational interactions between particles are always attractive. Therefore, the larger a piece of matter is, the more gravitational force it exerts on its surroundings.
This dominance of gravity at long distances makes the job of modeling a chunk of the Universe easier. To a first approximation, it is often a good idea to neglect the other forces, and to model the objects as if they were interacting only through gravity. In many cases, we can also neglect the intrinsic dimensions of the objects, treating each object as a point in space with a given mass. All this greatly simplifies the mathematical treatment of a system, by leaving out most of the physics and chemistry that would be needed in a more accurate treatment.

Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating.

Our members understand that the truth about fasting probably lies somewhere in between, but there is a lot of interest in the science behind how fasting affects the body and specifically hormone levels such as HGH (Human Growth Hormone).
For some added clarity, we turned to a partner of ours, Dr. Peter Attia, who specializes in the applied science of longevity.
Studies have reported intermittent fasting can dramatically increase HGH levels. Is that true?
“Fasting does affect your hormone levels,” notes Dr. Attia. “Specifically IGF (goes down), testosterone (usually down), and thyroid function often deteriorates.” But, Dr. Attia believes, “it’s hard to know what happens exactly with HGH, since it’s such a pulsatile (burst-like) hormone and not helpful to measure directly.” Or in other words, the jury is still out on how fasting impacts HGH specifically and whether any impact would be beneficial.
Also Dr. Attia doesn’t believe that cutting calories and losing belly weight fast are necessarily the only or even main benefits of fasting. Yes, intermittent fasting can have these effects, but the benefit of fasting is “more likely related to enhanced autophagy (the process of cellular self-cleansing that breaks down/recycles damaged molecules and cellular organelles), reduced inflammation, glycogen depletion, and the psychological benefits of learning that you can thrive without

Alzheimer’s and dementia are neurodegenerative diseases, which refers to progressive brain cell death that happens over time as fewer and fewer nerve cells and connections occur in the brain. This level of degeneration leads to significant memory loss, and for most, results in around-the-clock assistance with daily tasks.
Incredibly, most people associate Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia with aging, but there is no evidence that aging alone causes neurodegenerative diseases, despite the majority of diagnoses being in that of older people.
There are many contributing factors that are known to affect memory, and other neurological changes that have been attributed to the development and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia, but the good news is that with diet and lifestyle changes, the risk can be reduced.

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure. Similar to the effect of music therapy, some researches have suggested that the sounds dolphins emit through their whistles and clicks help produce these changes.

Retrieved Text: In biology, echolocation, or biosonar, is the physiological process of emitting sound waves and interpreting the echoes reflected back to the emitter in order to identify objects and determine their direction and distance. Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

Advocates of local seeds point out these seeds have certain hardiness and are of socio-cultural value for farmers. They also are a source of income and an indicator of food sovereignty, with the dual function of satisfying household food requirements and providing a stock of seeds for replanting.
In contrast, other voices are advocating for Genetically Modified (GM) seed, scientifically designed to withstand environmental hazards. However, GM seeds, long promoted at the international level and strongly encouraged in sub-Saharan Africa, has its limitations. According to advocates of local seeds, GM seeds are more water demanding and require large amounts of chemical fertilizers, pollute groundwater, weaken soils, degrade biodiversity and affect human health.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

In announcing the project, the Navy's Marine Mammal Program will use their own trained search dolphins to locate the vaquitas. The service has used bottlenose dolphins for underwater mine detection mossions since the 1950's that began after WWII. The Navy has found the biological sonar of dolphins, echolocation, makes them uniquely effective at locating mines at sea so they can be avoided or removed. The hope is that their large dolphins can help in the capture of some of the remaining vaquitas and corral them into secure bays protected from the illigal fishing boays and their nets.
Protection efforts for the vaquita have been underway for some time but the illicit fish trade for China has continued to cause their population to decline. While concerns exist for potentially loosing any captured vaquitas, it is hoped that a breeding population will be protected and allow for future release from the corralled bays.
Captive breeding has been successful with other rare species but it is necessary to capture a few animals for a program. With a population of less than 100 individual vaquitas surviving, there's little time to loose.

The goal of every storage system is to keep cannabis seeds viable for as long as possible. Viability means that seeds are able to sprout or germinate by the time you plant them. You must choose a container or a storage method that will preserve viability. The container has to be dry and clean while the walls or the outer surface should be lightproof.
Remember that fresh seeds are better than preserved seeds. Indeed, cannabis seeds can be preserved for up to a decade when properly kept but fresh seeds are still better and easier to germinate than preserved ones. It could take days for a mature seed to germinate while a fresh one may only take earlier.
Make sure that you are storing viable seeds! Look for seeds that are dark in color (shades of dark brown, black and blue) because these seeds are likely viable. Do not preserve seeds that are light green, green or white because these seeds are immature and will never sprout.
Preserve seeds that are round and shiny. Seeds that are irregularly shaped and have cracked shells may not be able to germinate.

So focused are they on making the pieces fit, they could be failing to appreciate the wonders coming to light in the picture itself. You can see an example of this in two papers about echolocation; a discussion of the second of these will follow tomorrow.
Think of the awe any sensitive person, even a scientist, should feel as he thinks about biosonar! Imagine the ability to bounce sound off objects in the dark and gain precise information about shapes, textures, and motions. Bats do it. Whales do it. Captain Dave Anderson, who leads whale-watching tours in California, said that a dolphin can tell the difference between a golf ball and a ping-pong ball by sound alone (Illustra Media, Living Waters). That’s not just echolocation. It is “indistinguishable from magic,” in Arthur C. Clarke’s famous comment about sufficiently advanced technology. Illustra’s animation of dolphin sonar reveals numerous complex parts working together to make this possible. Artificial sonar doesn’t come close.
How does echolocation work? Shouldn’t that be a focus in science? It is for some scientists, who eagerly learn all they can about sonar in toothed whales and bats for the sheer pleasure of understanding a complex biological system that works superbly well. It is, too, for some engineers, who explore design principles in biological sonar that might have applications for human technology. But for many evolutionary biologists, there seems to

As mentioned in the previous section, a seed basically consists of a seed coat, a nutrient reserve and an embryo. Though the basic structure is the same, the amount of nutrients contained in each seed's reserve, the type of surrounding protective membrane, its thickness, the shape and taste of the fruit enclosing it differ greatly from one another. Everything from the shape to the color of the seed coat and the materials it is made from varies according to the plant's species and habitat.
Seeds reveal marvelous wonders of creation. To give one example, an apricot contains just one pit, or seed, which is well protected by a hard shell. The fleshy interior tastes sweet and is suitable for eating – good food for birds, rodents, insects and other animals as well as people. The fact that the fruit consists of two such sections is also opportune for the plant, for when the apricot is eaten, the seed enclosed in the hard casing at the fruit’s center is exposed, and thus has a chance of germinating in a suitable place and growing into a new tree.
In contrast to the apricot, the kiwi is a fruit that contains numerous little edible seeds, rather than just one. The seeds of this fleshy fruit are grouped together. And because they are so numerous, even if one part of the fruit is eaten, their chances of sprouting into a new plant are increased.

They languish in hot weather, so in warm climates, such as in California or the lower southern states, plant sweet pea seeds fall through late winter for early spring bloom. In cold zones, it’s much wiser to do your soil preparation in the fall, partly because sweet peas need to be planted so early that the deep frost may not be fully out of the ground.
You can either start seeds indoors — in deep containers to prevent root disturbance at transplanting — or plant them outside about 2 inches deep as soon as the ground thaws in spring. Either way, soaking the seeds for 24 hours before planting or filing them a bit speeds germination, which takes about two weeks outside but happens much quicker indoors with bottom heat. Slugs love sweet peas, so be prepared to fend them off your seedlings. And pinching out the tips when the sweet peas are 4 or 5 inches high will give you more stems and a stronger plant.

They’re talking about the snow leopard and how climate change will affect its glacial habitat and food supply. While the snowy peaks of the nearby Andean mountains are not somewhere you would find snow leopards, this doesn’t stop them passionately discussing the big cat’s plight.
Sara had never heard of a snow leopard before she wandered into one of Huari’s community halls during a free environmental documentary screening. The screening is part of a weekly education program started by the Huari Provincial Government’s Director of Environmental Initiatives, Carlos García. Each screening is accompanied by a guest lecturer who talks about the video and how it relates to life in Huari.
“Sara came up to me after watching the film and said ‘What is the point of showing us that video if the snow leopards are all going to die?’” Carlos says.
Considering that the average Peruvian only spends 11 years in formal education (9 years in rural areas), the municipality’s free lecture series – exploring topics such as freshwater ecosystems, forest restoration, evolution, the cosmos and caves – is a crucial way for communities to learn more about the world around them.

I also obtained valuable connections for medical school by getting to know some hospital lab directors. This experience was invaluable, yet I was insulted and mocked for this simply because it was volunteer work. By the way, I could not do this work for money anyway because I would have had to go through graduate school for that. Money would have been a nice benefit, but I realized later that volunteering (especially to gain experience in a future career) is something everyone should try at least once their life.
Thinking that money is the cure-all for misery is an impoverished view of what it means to obtain happiness and fulfillment. Obviously there are other rational ways of achieving happiness that lie beyond obtaining wealth. One of them just so happens to be giving of one’s time and effort without expecting material reward.

If you switch to snow tires in the winter, start thinking about when you’re going to switch back to your summer tires. You should swap your snow tires out for your summer tires as soon as you feel it’s safe to do so. Snow tires are much more than just a different tread. Snow tires are designed to perform at colder temperatures. The rubber is designed to stay soft and grip when it’s below 7 C. When temperatures warm up, you will not get a crisp response from snow tires. The rubber on snow tires is very flexible and will wear quickly, and probably unevenly, in warm temperatures and on dry pavement. Summer tires are a harder compound which will give you better performance, and better fuel economy, in warm weather. Book your car in to have the tires swapped as soon as you think you’re ready. If you wait for the last minute (like everybody else) you may experience wait times to get into your tire shop or dealership.

For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes.

Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating.

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure.

There are over 900 species of bats found throughout the world. Wisconsin and Minnesota are home to seven species, all insect eaters. Three species spend only summer months in our area. The remaining four species are cave bats, are the most common, and remain here throughout the year. These bats are the little brown bat, big brown bat, eastern pipistrelle, and northern myotis. They are found in caves, abandoned mines, and buildings.
Cave bats range in size from three to five inches in length with wingspans of eight to thirteen inches. They weigh very little, from a tenth of an ounce to one-half an ounce. Bats can live to be twenty to thirty years old and usually have only one young, called a pup, each year. Because they are mammals, the baby bat is born alive and fed milk by the mother.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Listening in to these flying acrobats using a bat detector and hearing how they use their squeaks and pips to hunt their prey is amazing, especially if it is still light enough to then see them nimbly dart and dip in the night sky to catch their dinner.

Why are their clicks so loud? Why do they make so much noise? Most of the work to date indicates that the biosonar system of toothed whales and dolphins has evolved primarily as a foraging tool to find and catch food, and the loud signals allow them to find small targets, sometimes at long distances.
Dolphin echolocation was not verified as a sensory modality until the mid-twentieth century (Kellogg, 1958; Norris, Prescott, Asa-Dorian, & Perkins, 1961). Much of the early work examining the biosonar of small toothed whales and dolphins was conducted with animals in laboratory settings.

Echolocation is the method that some bats use to catch insects and other moving creatures. They are able to use sound waves to determine where the insect is. When a bat is hunting it makes a series of high-pitched sounds. The sound waves travel through the air and bounce off of objects. When the sound waves return to the bat it can tell the bat where the object is. A bat can use sound waves to tell the difference between objects that are stationary or moving. For example, a bat uses sound waves to avoid hitting a tree and immediately afterwards uses sound waves to catch a mosquito. Bats probably have the best techniques for echolocation of any animal on earth. The sounds they make are often much higher than the human ear can hear.
How do sound waves travel back to a bat? It is similar to how a mirror reflects light. If you hold a small mirror in your hand and maneuver it in the sunlight you can see the light reflecting off of the mirror and onto other objects. This is similar to how sound waves are reflected. The bat emits a high-frequency sound. The sound waves hit an object and are then reflected back to the bat. This high-tech system allows bats to fly in total darkness. They not only see where they are going, but can also catch their prey. When you look at pictures of bats you can see that many have large ears and interesting nose

However, if the symptoms become a problem, then this may be a more serious condition known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)2. GORD in babies may be associated with a food allergy or cow’s milk allergy.
Reflux and regurgitation can be very worrying for parents, however this is quite normal for babies in the first few months of life. Reflux usually happens within a few minutes of feeding and is due to the muscles in the bottom of the food pipe (oesophagus) being too relaxed2. It affects more than 40% of babies and usually gets better by itself3. Most babies will grow out of these symptoms by the time they are 12 months of age2.
If your baby is experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, please discuss your concerns with your child’s healthcare professional.
Some babies can develop GORD as the result of an allergy to the protein found in cow’s milk2. In these cases the symptoms are delayed and similar to many other conditions that are common in babies. This can make diagnosis difficult, even for doctors. If cow’s milk protein allergy is suspected, your healthcare professional may suggest removing cow’s milk protein from your child’s diet. For breastfed babies, this may involve eliminating cow’s milk from the mother’s diet. For bottle fed babies, this will mean changing to a low allergy formula, prescribed by your doctor.

Your baby's weight is a vital statistic for many reasons.
One of the first question new parents ask is how much their baby weighs. A perfectly normal full-term newborn can weigh from 5 pounds, 8 ounces, to 8 pounds, 13 ounces, the KidsHealth from Nemours website explains. Babies who weigh less or more than normal can develop a higher incidence of health problems at birth and possibly later in life.
Because babies gain about half a pound a week in the last month of pregnancy, according to MayoClinic.com, it stands to reason that the longer a baby stays in the womb, the heavier he'll be. This is true until the placenta starts to age, normally around two weeks after your due date. When this happens, your baby might actually start to lose weight. Many post-mature babies have loose, wrinkled, peeling skin and an emaciated look, because they've lost subcutaneous fat as the placenta became less effective at delivering nutrients to them.
A number of genetic and congenital issues can affect your baby's weight. A baby who has large, heavier parents has a higher chance of being larger and heavier at birth. Firstborns often weigh less than their siblings. A baby with a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome or a congenital heart condition might also weigh less at birth. Congenital infections such as rubella, syphilis or cytomegalovirus can also cause intrauterine growth restriction and smaller-than-normal babies.

Hypocalcemia is when a person doesn't have enough calcium in the blood. In babies, it’s called neonatal hypocalcemia. Your baby can get it at different times and from different causes.
Early hypocalcemia happens in the first 2 to 3 days of a baby's life. It is more likely to go away.
Late hypocalcemia starts in the first week or weeks after birth and is less likely to go away.
What causes hypocalcemia in the newborn?
Early hypocalcemia can have a variety of causes and usually goes away.
Late hypocalcemia is rare and has a number of known causes. Late hypocalcemia may be caused by drinking cow's milk or formula that has too much phosphate. This is no longer a common cause. Hypocalcemia can also be caused by a problem with parathyroid hormone. This hormone is made by the parathyroid glands in the neck. It helps keep the amount of calcium and phosphorus at a normal level in the blood. Low parathyroid hormone levels can cause too little calcium in the blood. A number of conditions, such as DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome), may cause low parathyroid hormone levels. This is because calcium and phosphorus levels in the body are interrelated. Low magnesium levels may also cause low calcium levels. This is because calcium levels are related to levels of magnesium.
Which newborns are at risk for hypocalcemia?
Hypocalcemia is more common in babies who are premature or who have a low birth weight. This is because their parathyroid glands are less mature. Babies whose growth has been slower

If you’re an avid weather enthusiast, than you’ve probably already seen discussions of a potential major snowstorm right before New Years. Even those who don’t track storms as rigorously have probably already heard rumors of possible heavy snow to close out the year. Guidance has been quite consistent on showing big storm potential between the 29th and 30th of December, and per usual, the models aren’t sold on one single outcome just yet. With the storm being a full week away, this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.
We can’t argue with the fact that the potential for a major east coast snowstorm is certainly there, but the question remains will all pieces of the puzzle come together in time to bring a big storm into fruition? We’ll show you the latest analysis on what’s going on, and hopefully will be able to clear some questions up along the way.
Over the last 48 hours, all the computer model guidance that we use as tools to help forecast the weather, have shown a major snowstorm impacting the east coast at one time or another. The latest guidance doesn’t seem to show the same confidence as it once was on an all-out blizzard scenario, but that doesn’t mean it won’t necessarily go down that way.

Recent evidence reinforces that your thinking, and even your emotions, impact not only your body and well-being during pregnancy but also that of your unborn baby.
In fact, during pregnancy all of your thoughts have a direct physical connection to your child. As you think and feel, your body naturally transfers these emotions to your child through neurohormones in your body. In reality, your emotions are thoughts that you feel, and these feelings are passed directly to your baby.
Pregnancy is a significant life event that brings along with it a number of thoughts and feeling. Bring along with that the overwhelm of pregnancy hormones, and you have the recipe for an onslaught of emotions. Emotions may arise from how you perceive your pregnancy, plans for the nursery or baby shower, your marriage relationship, your desire to work, and more. So, how does this affect your child, and what can you do about it?
Research indicates that mothers who had more negative feelings throughout their pregnancies had babies who were slower to develop after birth. Likewise, babies whose mothers had an overall more positive affect were faster developing after birth. But, do emotions affect how the baby feels in the womb, and how do we know?

Whooping cough is caused by a bacteria called Bordatella Pertussis. It is spread through droplets in the air produced when people with it cough. Ultimately, it causes (somewhat unsurprisingly) a cough, chest infections and even pneumonia in people affected.
Indeed it is the cough of this disease that is so very characteristic - often just hearing the cough itself is enough to make the diagnosis (watch this video at about 43 seconds in: child with whooping cough).
The cough happens in quite nasty little fits - people cough and cough and cough until the run out of breath, and this is followed by a sharp intake of breath, which causes the “whoop” sound. People often have such intense coughing fits that they get to the point of vomiting with them too. I remember being fine for a few hours, then suddenly having hours where i simply could not stop coughing and was gasping for breath - a pretty unpleasant state to be in.

The Sun's magnetic field is expected to flip upside down within weeks as its north and south poles swap sides.
The phenomenon, which will send "ripple effects" throughout the solar system, happens once every 11 years as the solar cycle reaches its peak.
It will be observed throughout the heliosphere - the vast region of space affected by the Sun's magnetic field, which extends billions of miles beyond Pluto.
The swap could cause intergalactic weather events such as geomagnetic storms, which can cause radio blackouts and interfere with satellites.
The heightened solar activity it coincides with is also expected to give stargazers a better glimpse of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights.
Todd Hoeksema, a scientist at Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory, said the polar reversal takes place as the Sun's magnetic field moves north or south from the equator, eroding the existing pole as it does so.
"It's kind of like a tide coming in or going out," he said. "Each little wave brings a little more water in, and eventually you get to the full reversal."
Latest measurements show the Sun technically has two south poles, caused by its two hemispheres being out of sync.
Phil Scherrer, who works with Mr Hoeksema at the observatory, said: "The north pole has already changed sign, while the south pole is racing to catch up.
"Soon, however, both poles will be reversed, and the second half of solar max will be under way."

The research, published in Ecological Entomology, examined changes in the life cycles of butterflies at different elevations of a mountain range in central Spain. They served as a model for some of the changes expected to come with warming temperatures, particularly in mountain landscapes.
The researchers found that butterfly species which already tend to emerge later in the year or fly higher in the mountains have evolved to deal with a shorter window of opportunity to reproduce, and as a result may fare worse in a warming climate, compared to those that emerge over a longer time period.
"Insects and plants are at the base of the food pyramid and are extremely important, but they often get less attention when we are studying the ecological impacts of climate change," said Javier G. Illan, with the Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University.
"We're already expecting localized extinctions of about one third of butterfly species, so we need to understand how climate change will affect those that survive," he said. "This research makes it clear that some will do a lot better than others."
Butterflies may be particularly sensitive to a changing climate, Illan said, and make a good model to study the broader range of ecological effects linked to insects. Their flight dates are a relevant indicator of future responses

It’s not an easy question to answer. In the lab, scientists can set up a series of seawater tanks with a variety of pH levels to figure out how different species react to more acidic water, observing the structure of their shells, their metabolism, or their behavior. Or researchers can go to areas with naturally high carbon dioxide and acid levels, such as natural carbon dioxide seeps, to study how those ecosystems are faring. But learning from these experiments is not enough: to really understand how acidification will affect organisms, scientists need to observe it in the field.
There are two main ways to go about this: zoom-in on individual species and see how they are affected by rising acidity, or zoom-out and look at how entire ecosystems are changing. However, neither is particularly easy. The ocean is undergoing so many changes at once—warming water, acidification, nutrient pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction, to name a few—that it can be difficult to tease out the exact impacts of each.
There was great excitement, and worry, when the first physical evidence of ocean acidification was reported: the shells of sea butterflies in Antarctic waters are dissolving. Sea butterflies (Limacina helicina) are delicate animals. Instead of dragging their bodies around with a

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

At the Fruitful Field we prefer to let all of these live unless they are creating a problem. If there are just a couple of holes in your plant leaves let them go. However, if they are completely destroying your crop, by all means check out the Control section below.
Caterpillars damage plants by eating their leaves and in some cases their fruits. Some do very little damage, particularly to large plants. Others do significant damage such as the hornworm on the right. Hornworms are usually found by tomato farmers who are trying to figure out where half their plant went. Tobacco hornworms are voracious eaters and can increase their weight ten-thousandfold in less than twenty days .
If caterpillars become a problem you may decide to get rid of them. If it is a small infestation, they are easy enough to pick off. Be careful because some hairy varieties have the ability to sting. For a larger infestation spraying is possible with bacillus thuringensis (BT). BT is a bacteria that kills caterpillars but does not affect humans. Be careful with any spraying since BT can affect buttefly and moth populations. Please spray as small an area as possible, and never spray on a windy day. You can find BT at Home Depot under the brand name Thuricide.

Whatever your politics or your view of Donald Trump in the US, there can be no doubt that perceptions of him have been affected by allegations of interference from Russia. Likewise in the UK there has been concern that the EU referendum was unduly influenced by outsiders, analytics firms and illegal collusion over data resources.
Election meddling in this way can affect outcomes, futures of countries and even presidencies. There is no doubt that it’s undesirable, so it’s laudable that information commissioner Elizabeth Denham has launched an investigation into the role of data in politics, specifically its misuse. According to a BBC report she is looking for extra powers to do something about the impact of interference in elections.
The killer sentence, however, is this one: “Given the transnational nature of data the investigation will involve exploring how companies operating internationally deploy such practices with impact or handling of data in the UK.” This is self-evidently right and nobody would dispute it.
What’s less clear is exactly what the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or even the British government could do to stop any interference that comes from other countries. Ask them to stop? Complain to another government, which will either already have outlawed the activity or be complicit in it? Neither of those options looks terribly effective.
Even assuming a government were to make a successful intervention, it’s by no means clear what happens next. In the UK, let’s suppose for a moment that there were to be solid evidence – proof, indeed – that whether

The Sun's magnetic field is expected to flip upside down within weeks as its north and south poles swap sides.
The phenomenon, which will send "ripple effects" throughout the solar system, happens once every 11 years as the solar cycle reaches its peak.
It will be observed throughout the heliosphere - the vast region of space affected by the Sun's magnetic field, which extends billions of miles beyond Pluto.
The swap could cause intergalactic weather events such as geomagnetic storms, which can cause radio blackouts and interfere with satellites.
The heightened solar activity it coincides with is also expected to give stargazers a better glimpse of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights.
Todd Hoeksema, a scientist at Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory, said the polar reversal takes place as the Sun's magnetic field moves north or south from the equator, eroding the existing pole as it does so.
"It's kind of like a tide coming in or going out," he said. "Each little wave brings a little more water in, and eventually you get to the full reversal."
Latest measurements show the Sun technically has two south poles, caused by its two hemispheres being out of sync.
Phil Scherrer, who works with Mr Hoeksema at the observatory, said: "The north pole has already changed sign, while the south pole is racing to catch up.
"Soon, however, both poles will be reversed, and the second half of solar max will be under way."

The notion of :Sophisticated" is toyed with, an abstract inspiration.

The mannerism is then translated into cut and construction, to discreetly but distinctly affect the deportment and psychology of the wearer.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Election meddling in this way can affect outcomes, futures of countries and even presidencies. There is no doubt that it’s undesirable, so it’s laudable that information commissioner Elizabeth Denham has launched an investigation into the role of data in politics, specifically its misuse.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

As early as 1963, the Ohio Legislature tried to reclassify the mourning dove as a game species, legalizing dove hunting, but all attempts have been thwarted without majority support. Then the Ohio Department of Wildlife joined the fray, establishing the state’s first dove hunting season in 80 years—only to have a court order take it away a couple of years later. Finally in 1994 the Ohio General Assembly passed a house bill to allow dove hunting.

There are many regulations governing mourning dove hunting. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife, because the mourning dove is a migratory bird, a bird that travels with the seasons, mourning dove hunting is regulated by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Goose and duck hunting are also regulated under this act.
One national regulation is that hunters can only use shotguns that hold three or fewer shells. The other major regulation is that hunters cannot hunt on a baited field.

While flipping through the pages of the North American Hunting Club book “Hunting Predators; Proven Tactics That Work” by my good friend Gordy Krahn, I stumbled across some interesting weather data.

The survey’s focus was factors that influence the response of predators while calling. Coyote and red fox were the furbearers of choice.
Time of year kicks off the survey’s emphasis. Response for red fox was the highest in the winter months over fall hunting. Interestingly, coyote response rates were higher in fall and spring. Red fox responded more vigorously in cold conditions while coyotes loped to a call better in warmer temperatures.
Along with the rise and fall of the thermometer mercury, the survey queried about snow conditions. Respondents noted that the red fox came to calls better in deeper snow. Coyote calling success fared better with less snow. Keep that in mind during El Nino winters and how they

Their lineage stretches back far beyond that of people, and their fossils are sometimes found at the foothills of the Alasre Mountains. Individual maastrin praefervi are thought to grow quite old, living perhaps hundreds, if not thousands of years, but little is known about their lives because they prefer to spend time in the open sea. Some scholars propose that they can dive, like some whales, to feed on krakens and giant squids, but others point out their need to bask near the surface. It is true that they sport a fin like that of the suchul praefervi, which can absorb and store heat, but their plasma is magically charged, and so their fins are likely used more for thermoregulation, possibly storing energy to keep them warm during brief visits to the depths. The fins also seem to play a role in communication and courtship, though two maastrin praefervi are seen near the surface rarely enough that much about their mating rituals, remain a mystery. Males are easiest to see in the open ocean, silvery with white and blue that stands out as a show of strength and health to their mate. Female maastrin praefervi are darker in color, though their fins, as in their mates, are bright blue, like their plasma.

Over 2000 quern stones have been found along the crags, dating back to the Iron Age. There also seems to be some evidence that the Romans passed this way too. Following the Norman Conquest, Wharncliffe was one of the many ‘chases’ in the area set aside as a royal hunting park for the Lords of Hallamshire.
The Wortley family have had a home on the site of Wortley Hall, probably since Norman times. It was Sir Thomas Wortley that built the first lodge at the top of the crags in 1510, there have been two other Wharncliffe Lodges since, the current structure being a Victorian rebuild. Some features of the original lodge still remain.
The Wortleys seem to have had a rare talent for annoying the locals, especially by enclosing land for their deer park. Two hamlets were destroyed when the chase was extended, Stanfield and Whiley and it was the actions of Richard Wortley in 1589 that led to bitter conflict with locals and the creation of the satirical ballad, ‘The Dragon of Wantley.’ In 1591, eleven people were charged with hunting deer in the park and vandalising walls and fences.

Solar panels have a rating based on how much DC power it produces under standard test conditions, which just happens to be 1000 watts of sunlight per square meter of surface. But if you’re not at the equator at noon on a sunny day without cloud cover, your solar panels will never function ideally. The average solar panel produces about 200 watts of electricity. This varies from solar panel to solar panel based on the size and efficiency of the panel. What will actually determine the amount of energy a solar panel produces is the solar panel efficiency, solar panel size, and the amount of sunlight hitting the panel.
Shade, the direction and angle your solar panels are facing, and the surrounding temperature will affect how efficient solar panels will be. Panels placed in shaded areas will receive less sunlight and thus produce less energy. Temperatures above 77o F decrease the efficiency of a solar panel. And if you want your solar panels to absorb the most amount of sunlight, they must be placed at an angle of 10-60 degrees facing south, west, or east.
The average size of an installed solar panel system is 5kW. On a sunny day, it should produce 5000 watts of power per hour. Larger solar panel systems will absorb more sunlight and produce more power and the opposite is true for smaller solar panel systems.

Well-timed rains and moderate summer temperatures have the Chicago area headed for an impressive display of fall colors.
Barring unexpected changes in the weather over the next two months, vivid displays are likely in all but the northernmost sections of the Midwest, where severe drought may lead to less intense colors while encouraging leaves to fall from trees earlier than usual.
These are the views of two of this area's most respected plant scientists and veteran observers of the region's fall color scene.
Both experts anticipate an especially generous helping of reds in this year's color arsenal if sunny, warm days and cool but largely frost-free nights dominate between now and the color peak. That peak around here is likely to arrive the third or fourth week of October--later than in years past when earlier mid-October color peaks were more common.
The Morton Arboretum's chief scientist, Gary Watson, says that more than the weather, shorter days and longer nights this time of year have the largest impact on the annual explosion of color in foliage. Environmental factors, including plant genetics, rainfall and the nutrients available to trees, all impact the seasonal color change. But, when it comes right down to it, the seasonal shift in sunlight intensity and the arrival of shorter days and longer nights prove most critical in encouraging leaves to cut back on, and ultimately stop, the production of chlorophyll, which produces the leaves' characteristic green color. When chlorophyll is reduced and finally eliminated, as happens when days shorten,

If you’ve been here your whole life, however, you will definitely be familiar with its effects even if you never realized the cause.
Water is called “hard” when it has a higher than average amount of minerals like magnesium or calcium. Water that is collected through wells, springs, or other underground sources is filtered through rocks that contain these minerals and it carries sediment from them with it to the surface. It affects plumbing systems and your skin and hair so the impact is substantial.
Hard water isn’t completely bad. Some people prefer the taste of harder water, in fact many bottled water companies actually add minerals to the water during bottling in order to recreate this familiar taste. Calcium and magnesium are also required in a healthy diet so drinking hard water can help ensure your body is getting the nutrients it needs.
Hard water also happens to contain lower sodium so it’s generally healthier to consume than soft water. This is very convenient for those who need to watch how much salt they consume.

Many of us here at KARE 11 have started feeling the rainy day blues after this long stretch of gray and gloomy days, and it got us wondering, does the weather really impact our mood?
Hennepin Healthcare Psychologist Talee Vang is helping us verify if the weather can actually affect how we feel.
“It’s not so much the rain, but the darkness that can affect your mood,” Dr. Vang explains.
Darkness, like the gloomy days we’ve been having lately, can alter the chemical balance in your brain, Vang says.
"When it's mostly dark outside what happens is our body starts to produce less serotonin," Vang says.
Serotonin is a chemical in our bodies that helps us regulate our mood.
So yes, Vang says you can get more depressed, sad or anxious when it rains.
"Our bodies also produce more melatonin so that makes us feel more lethargic, sleepy and tired," Vang says.
So if you've been feeling low energy lately that's why.
Plus no sun means less vitamin D which can also make you more depressed and tired.
Vang says the longer you go without it the worse it can get.
"We're having several days of cloud cover and that's going to impact your mood," Vang says.
This feeling of fatigue and tiredness is commonly known as Seasonal Affective

Solar panels have a rating based on how much DC power it produces under standard test conditions, which just happens to be 1000 watts of sunlight per square meter of surface. But if you’re not at the equator at noon on a sunny day without cloud cover, your solar panels will never function ideally. The average solar panel produces about 200 watts of electricity. This varies from solar panel to solar panel based on the size and efficiency of the panel. What will actually determine the amount of energy a solar panel produces is the solar panel efficiency, solar panel size, and the amount of sunlight hitting the panel.
Shade, the direction and angle your solar panels are facing, and the surrounding temperature will affect how efficient solar panels will be. Panels placed in shaded areas will receive less sunlight and thus produce less energy. Temperatures above 77o F decrease the efficiency of a solar panel. And if you want your solar panels to absorb the most amount of sunlight, they must be placed at an angle of 10-60 degrees facing south, west, or east.
The average size of an installed solar panel system is 5kW. On a sunny day, it should produce 5000 watts of power per hour. Larger solar panel systems will absorb more sunlight and produce more power and the opposite is true for smaller solar panel systems.

Solar Geyser System temperatures can reach dangerously high temperatures – close to or even boiling point (70 to 98°C). If sufficient hot water is not used during hot sunny days, the temperature of the solar water heating system (and geyser) will just keep on rising because no cold water is entering the system to bring the temperature down.
The problem is that most households these days only use hot water in the evening or early morning when people are at home – coming home, going to bed or getting ready for work in the morning.
During hot sunny days when solar heating is most efficient they are at work. No hot water usage is taking place during the day and the solar geyser system temperature just keeps on rising.
With the current drought experienced in the Western Cape and other parts of South Africa overheating of solar geyser systems is even worst. This is caused by using less water in a drive to save water, which in turn means less hot water is consumed.
Another factor that contributes to overheating is over designing of solar collectors. Some experts might reason that to ensure enough hot water is available for a household the collector needs to be overdesigned.
Although this practice cause faster heating of the solar hot water system, it can cause overheating if the hot water is not consumed efficiently to prevent overheating.
The use of EVT (Evacuated Tube) solar collectors can also worsen an overheating situation due to their high efficiency, especially if overdesigned.

Although the cooler weather is a chance to relax indoors around a warm fire, the shorter daylight hours can affect some people with a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD. SAD is a depressive disorder that is directly related to the loss of sunlight in the fall and winter months. The symptoms can look just like depression: difficulty getting out of bed, overeating, and lack of energy can all be connected to it. There could also be a decrease in activity, trouble keeping focused, and irritability.
Since SAD was identified as a disorder, many research studies were conducted to find treatments. One of the best solutions was to trick the brain into thinking it is still receiving ample doses of sunlight by using phototherapy devices like dawn simulators – lamps that turn on as the sun comes up providing exposure to its strong bulbs for 30 minutes each morning. Light therapy boxes for SAD treatment are also known as light boxes, bright light therapy boxes and phototherapy boxes. Light therapy treatments involve 20 to 60 minutes of daily exposure to cool-white florescent light and there are many products on the market for this purpose.

Atlanta could be, or not be, directly in her path. But the last few days have been absolutely gorgeous — cool, sunny, no humidity and a kiss of Fall in the air.
Atlantans start preparing for a major storm days in advance, buying up water, bread, milk — and likely lots of beer and wine — so that if you wait until the last minute you will find yourself staring at empty shelves in any grocery or convenience store. Five days ago I heard from dear friends in Tampa, when Irma hadn’t even made it to Puerto Rico yet, and there was no gas to be found and the store shelves were bare. Not knowing which way the path of the storm may take, they were undecided whether to leave. By Saturday morning, however, they made the decision to evacuate. I’m praying that when they return home they will find everything safe and sound.

While some people might be able to brave the beach all day until the sun dips down, that can be a recipe for disaster for anyone with a blood sugar disorder — after all, heat and humidity affect your metabolism, and can throw your carefully concocted diabetes management plan out of whack.
The first step to a safer and happier summer season is a better understanding of how diabetes and temperature interact on hot days. Take some time to learn exactly what diabetic challenges you may face, so you can prepare and protect yourself when the temperature rises.
Studies show that visits to the emergency room and hospitalizations go way up for diabetics during the hottest times of the year, and that’s not always traced to careless behavior. Some people simply don’t realize how much they need to change their routine when the temperature soars.
Diabetes impairs your ability to sweat, and since sweat is your body’s natural cooling system, you can get overheated a lot quicker than your neighbor.

For example, how fast water flows over the plates can drastically affect the ORP rating. Referred to as the flow rate, running your tap at full speed will make any ionized water system less effective, as the water is in contact with the ionizing plates for less time - allowing it to impact it to a lesser extent (1). Therefore, setting the faucet to a slower setting will produce higher ORP water and is recommended.
A second factor which affects the ability of any ionized water system to produce high ORP water, is the mineral content of the water in question. Tap water that has high mineral content is often referred to as “hard water”, whereas water with low mineral content is termed “soft water.” Where you live can determine whether your tap water is hard or soft, with higher mineral content making higher ORP water possible. How does this work?
Mineral content is the pathway through which ionization happens, by conducting the electric charge being produced by the plates (2). For this reason, more mineral content means more conduction and a higher ORP in the end.
While the above factors are important, with all else being equal, some ionized water system options are better than others. Continue onto the next

Well-timed rains and moderate summer temperatures have the Chicago area headed for an impressive display of fall colors.
Barring unexpected changes in the weather over the next two months, vivid displays are likely in all but the northernmost sections of the Midwest, where severe drought may lead to less intense colors while encouraging leaves to fall from trees earlier than usual.
These are the views of two of this area's most respected plant scientists and veteran observers of the region's fall color scene.
Both experts anticipate an especially generous helping of reds in this year's color arsenal if sunny, warm days and cool but largely frost-free nights dominate between now and the color peak. That peak around here is likely to arrive the third or fourth week of October--later than in years past when earlier mid-October color peaks were more common.
The Morton Arboretum's chief scientist, Gary Watson, says that more than the weather, shorter days and longer nights this time of year have the largest impact on the annual explosion of color in foliage. Environmental factors, including plant genetics, rainfall and the nutrients available to trees, all impact the seasonal color change. But, when it comes right down to it, the seasonal shift in sunlight intensity and the arrival of shorter days and longer nights prove most critical in encouraging leaves to cut back on, and ultimately stop, the production of chlorophyll, which produces the leaves' characteristic green color. When chlorophyll is reduced and finally eliminated, as happens when days shorten,

After rainfall, water can sit on the surface of the fruit for long periods, collecting for even longer in the stem bowl or hanging from the apical end of the fruit (typically resulting in stem-end or apical-end cracks). The longer fruit stays wet, the more likely cracking becomes. Some of the strategies which have proved effective in preventing this type of cracking are increasing airflow (such as by using helicopters) or the use of various coatings (see Figure 1). The crop load, or rather crop distribution, can also affect the length of time water stays on the fruit. Fruit clusters, where fruit are constantly in contact, will hold water, so this can be considered in training systems and pruning management. Canopy cover – having nice big leaves to protect the fruit underneath – might help here too. Within the tree Water moves around inside the tree as well and we can’t forget about that.

Electricity may seem costly, but the ease with which it is controlled and the lack of combustion products that affect plants such as water, ethylene and carbon monoxide makes it much easier and safer to use.
The need to ventilate freely when burning gas or paraffin reduces any savings from using these fuels and these heaters are only really useful for crops grown at low temperatures.
Other sustainable sources, such as ground source heat pumps, offer the hope of more environmentally friendly options in the future. Unfortunately, for now, they are not cheap, easy to install or particularly suitable for modest greenhouses.

It’s not an easy question to answer. In the lab, scientists can set up a series of seawater tanks with a variety of pH levels to figure out how different species react to more acidic water, observing the structure of their shells, their metabolism, or their behavior. Or researchers can go to areas with naturally high carbon dioxide and acid levels, such as natural carbon dioxide seeps, to study how those ecosystems are faring. But learning from these experiments is not enough: to really understand how acidification will affect organisms, scientists need to observe it in the field.
There are two main ways to go about this: zoom-in on individual species and see how they are affected by rising acidity, or zoom-out and look at how entire ecosystems are changing. However, neither is particularly easy. The ocean is undergoing so many changes at once—warming water, acidification, nutrient pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction, to name a few—that it can be difficult to tease out the exact impacts of each.

Such was the case for butterfly farmer Dancetta Feary. When her brother Mackey, the lead singer for Kalapana, died Feb. 20, 1999, she felt something inside her had ended and her world came crashing down.
Since then, she has come out of depression, survived a divorce and left behind a solace state and devastation to discover a whole new life in the world of butterflies. She is nicknamed the Butterfly Realtor.
“I raise butterflies because they are my passion, and my goal is to keep them abundant for future generations,” she explains.
Over the past 10 years, the Kaneohe resident has reared tens of thousands of her graceful winged friends.
“I can have several hundred eggs, 500 caterpillars and dozens of butterflies in one given day, depending on the season,” she says.
She has set up a safe haven right in her backyard and butterfly house.
Born to Bryant Mackey Feary Sr. and Regina Chong Feary Okimoto, Dancetta was raised on Maunalani Heights (Wilhelmina Rise, Kaimuki) and lived for 30 years on a street called “Mariposa” Drive, which means butterfly.
Like her graceful, fluttering pets, Dancetta has become independent and strong. She doesn’t feel that she is living alone now because she is always greeted by her buzzing caterpillars, which eat nonstop and eventually morph into dazzling monarch dancers. There are four stages in the metamorphosis of butterflies and moths: egg, larva, pupa and adult.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

There are, of course, valid causes for concern, but the other side of the argument also has pertinent points favouring re-introductions.
For those who may not be aware, re-introduction is the intentional and deliberate release of species back into the wild. These species are either bred, or captured and released from other areas where the species still exists. In various taxonomic groups, it usually involves species that are critically endangered or extinct in the wild. Technically, re-introduction usually involves the returning of species into locations or regions where they were previously found or recorded with a fair measure of confidence, but are now extinct. Hence some practitioners of re-introduction programmes prefer to call it "re-establishment".
Re-introduction programmes have been more predominantly focused on mammals and vertebrates like birds and occasionally amphibians. There are some well-known programmes since the early 1980's where biologists have studied the impacts of re-introducing a species into the habitat it once existed in.

Other symptoms described in the literature can include fat-filled yellow spots known as ‘eruptive xanthomas’, discolouration of small arteries and veins in the eye (lipaemia retinalis), and abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). These are the symptoms described by the medical profession.
This is the most common symptom of FCS. The pain can be mild, or severe and interfere with daily living. It is felt in the upper central region of the abdomen (the epigastric region) and can sometimes radiate to cause back pain. In extreme cases this can resemble peritonitis. There are reported cases of unnecessary surgery due to an incorrect diagnosis.
The pancreas is a small gland found behind the stomach responsible for secreting enzymes that help in digestion and hormones that supply different functions in the body. Acute pancreatitis happens when this gland inflames and causes pain, sometimes intense which is felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. Other symptoms of pancreatitis are nausea, sweating, chills, weakness, clammy skin and mild yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice). .
Some individuals can develop acute, recurrent pancreatitis, or necrotising pancreatis (when the pancreas starts to destroy itself). Both can be potentially lethal but are fortunately rarely occuring.
People with FCS are at a greater risk of developing diabetes type 2, particularly if they have experienced or are experiencing repeated bouts of pancreatitis.

Fletcher postulated that by excessively chewing, the food would mix properly with saliva. He claimed that by chewing thoroughly he could draw more strength from lesser amounts of food. At the ripe age of 58, fletcher decided to test his theory. He went up against athletes from Yale university in tests of Strength and Endurance. He outperformed them in every test, arousing curiosity and earning their respect.
Interesting how something that seems as insignificant as chewing your food can supposedly have such effects. To clarify, lets take a closer look at the known benefits of proper chewing.
Increasing the number of chews per bite affects hormone release in the gut that regulates appetite (3). One of these hormones, Ghrelin is found in high concentrations in the blood when fasting and suppressed after eating. Low amounts of Ghrelin signals for the decrease in hunger.
Chewing your food well takes time, but this gives the body a chance to activate hormones involved in turning off appetite. Less food is consumed as a result (2), decreasing the amount of calories taken on board. Having smaller portions as a result of feeling fuller sooner gives an advantage to those trying to control their weight by consuming less calories.
Chewing more from each bite of food affects the rate of thermogenesis (1). This refers to the heat produced during digestion. An increased rate of thermogenesis increases daily Energy Expenditure

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Waterloo and the Université libre de Bruxelles, appears in Nature Communications. If found that man-made dam reservoirs trap nearly one-fifth of the organic carbon moving from land to ocean via the world’s rivers.
While they can act as a significant source or sink for carbon dioxide, reservoirs are poorly represented in current climate change models.
There are currently in excess of 70,000 large dams worldwide. With the continuing construction of new dams, more than 90 per cent of the world’s rivers will be fragmented by at least one dam within the next 15 years.
The study’s researchers used a novel method to determine what happens to organic carbon traveling down rivers and were able to capture the impact of more than 70 per cent of the world’s man-made reservoirs by volume. Their model links known physical parameters such as water flow and reservoir size with processes that determine the fate of organic carbon in impounded rivers.
“With the model used in this study, we can better quantify and predict how dams affect carbon exchanges on a global scale,” said Van Cappellen, a professor in Waterloo’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences.

One way that aquatic invasive species move from one water body to another is when nearby rivers crest, Fuller said. Their floodwaters intermingle, along with the critters and plants in them.
Another way is when freshwater pours out the mouth of adjacent rivers into a bay. The river water can create a freshwater zone that acts as a bridge between the rivers, allowing species to migrate from one stream to the other.

Every minute of each day YOU choose between being healthy or sick, tired or energetic, fit or fat, happy or depressed. YOU constantly make decisions to: eat healthy foods or junk, eat regularly or skip meals, drink water or sodas, be sedentary or active, sleep or stay up late, rest or stress.
Are you really paying attention to your body or masking the symptoms of poor lifestyle choices?
What if there was a well guided path you could take to feel better every day? Would you take it?
Holistic Lifestyle Coaching is such a path. It may not always be straight, and it may be long, but it is not as complicated as you might think. Are you ready to take the journey?

Any breakdown in this system can create problems for the body. Possible symptoms of poor digestion are bloating, constipation, diarrhea, cramping, weigh gain, heartburn (or acid reflux) and loss of appetite. Other symptoms less well known caused by poor digestion are arthritis, skin problems, and allergies.
How does poor digestion start?
Eating the wrong food for your body is usually the start of digestive symptoms. Many people develop digestive problems from eating foods that they have sensitivities to, as well as eating refined sugar and other processed foods. The chemicalization of our food is a big culprit.
Other potential causes for signs of poor digestion are a history of heavy antibiotic use, exposure to toxins, hormonal imbalance or infection with parasites or other microbes.
There’s several reasons why someone may experience poor digestion. If you are having symptoms, the next step is to find out what factor, or combination of factors may be causing your distress.
It is important to have a well-functioning digestive system so your body gets the nutrition it needs to thrive from the foods you eat. All nourishment and healing begins in the stomach.

Needless to say, I knew nothing about the caramelization process that occurs with roasting. Here is today's lesson: Caramelization happens when dry heating or roasting foods with a high concentration of carbohydrates. Basically, it is the process of removal of water from a sugar (such as sucrose or glucose), after which some other -ization steps take place (isomerization, polymerisation, deliciousization). Removing the water brings out the sweetness of the vegetable. Every vegetable I used had a distinct flavour that wouldn't otherwise be so intense. The Brussels sprouts tasted infinitely more interesting, but the zucchini was especially sweet, and easily the star of this veggie medley.

The “lacto” in the name refers to the bacteria Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus bacteria can convert sugars into lactic acid through a naturally occurring fermentation process. Lactic acid is a natural preservative that inhibits the growth of harmful or putrefying bacteria. Lactic acid also promotes the growth of healthy bacteria in the intestinal tract. That is why lacto-fermented foods are considered probiotic foods. As well as the preservation advantages, lacto-fermentation also increases vitamin and enzyme levels, as well as digestibility, of the fermented food, as well as producing antibiotic and anticarcinogenic substances that may contribute to good health.
Lacto-fermented pickles are not to be confused with many of the pickles that are available to buy commercially – these are done with vinegar, which offers more predictable results, but no lactic acid.
lactobacillus + sugar + salt – oxygen + time = lactic-acid fermentation.
Lactobacillus can come from a prepared culture, fresh whey, or be naturally occurring.
Sugar is naturally present in vegetables and fruit.
Salt inhibits the growth of undesirable microorganisms and helps keep vegetables crisp.
Oxygen is limited to enable the anaerobic process, stopping oxidation and the growth of unwanted bacteria.
Time taken to ferment can vary from a few hours to a couple months or more. The temperature of the environment where fermentation occurs will affect the length of time.

Which of these methods is more effective and less stressful for the body is difficult to say, since each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.

There is a difference, but I think it’s more of a spectrum than a black or white issue. Some say that stocks are merely simmered bones with no seasoning, vegetables or other ingredients involved, while broth is boiled meat with vegetables and sometimes spices and seasoning added to the mix. Others say that both broth and stock can contain bones as well as meat, but the important difference is the ratio of meat to bone, whereas a stock would contain more bone and visa versa. Another opinion is that broths are merely flavoured stocks. Still others say broth is stock that is being used in a soup. Salt content is sometimes described as being the critical difference as well. Sifting through the intricacies of the arguments can become quite tedious.
If forced to ultimately distinguish between the two I would say that they are the same, save that stocks are made with bones and broths are made with meat. Stocks are thick and gelatinous like jello when cooled because of the collagen that is extracted from the bones and connective tissues while simmering. The gelatinous quality of stock makes it better than broth for deglazing pans and is often used in place of butter or cream to make sauces in this way.

Premium dried vegetables will retain most of its original nutrients and color. The flavor is also well retained and even improved as a result of being more concentrated.
Dried vegetables may be obtained by means of air drying or freeze drying.
With this method, dehydrated vegetables are obtained by passing warm air over the vegetables. The warm air causes the vegetables to lose water through evaporation. This is basically what the dehydrator does.
Air dried vegetables are usually cheaper than the freeze dried vegetables. This is because the process of air drying is cheaper than that of freeze drying.

ONE: We talked about volcanoes before. Those volcanoes have lava vesicles (the tubes that bring lava to the surface). When those vesicles cool, sometimes holes remain. Those holes are like tubes that go directly into the bedrock. Weather, water, and heat/cold can get in those vesicles and affect the bedrock.
TWO: When any type of earthquake happens, sometimes faults develop. Those faults are cracks in the surface and in the bedrock. Wherever there is a way in, the weather will get inside and start eroding the bedrock.
THREE: You already know that the Earth is always moving. When stress on the land happens, small joints can occur. Joints are tiny cracks in the land. They aren't big like a fault. They are small cracks sometimes created by folding on the surface.

Most food manufacturing companies will say that there is no definitive proof that organic food is better than chemically treated food. That said, certain tests and studies show that organically produced crops preserve the minerals in the soil.
This in turn increases the nutritional content in the fruits and vegetables thereby making them better for the human body. Because organic food is not chemically treated, there’s less chance of unknowingly consuming harmful chemicals. This means that the body will not be exposed to harmful chemical compounds that can lead to several life-threatening diseases such as different kinds of cancer and heart problems.
Pesticides and insecticides are used for the conventional processes of raising crops. The harmful chemicals and carcinogens released onto the plants can also affect the air that the farm workers are exposed to. Simple exposure to toxic chemicals via the skin is enough to wreck havoc on the body. Unfortunately, most farmers live with their families in areas that are commonly exposed to these toxins. Their food and water can also be contaminated; they unknowingly consume food tainted with chemicals.
Farm workers have the highest amount of exposure to dangerous chemicals and even the clothes they wear can act as carriers that their family members can come into contact with. By going organic, there’s less likelihood of pesticide poisoning among farm workers.
Fortunately, government agencies have now taken steps in monitoring the health of farmers and pesticide applicators.

People have utilized lactic acid fermentation for thousands of years. Fermented foods and vegetables represent a significant component of many diets in cultures across the world, think sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, sake, tempeh, yoghurt, cheese, sourdough, and even chocolate and coffee. Fermentation is a natural microbial process that relies on beneficial cultures, like lactic acid bacteria, already thriving on the surface of raw vegetables. Cultures transform the fresh vegetables into “pickled” foods by converting sugars to lactic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, and other beneficial substances. It is the lactic acid that is primarily responsible for preserving the vegetables, as well as creating the wonderful flavor and aroma of fermented foods.
How are fermented foods different from classic vinegar pickles?
Foods that are pickled are those that have been preserved in an acidic medium. Our handcrafted vegetable ferments are “pickled” with lactic acid. Our products are completely raw, living foods, full of rich enzymatic activity and probiotics and will remain preserved for years under refrigeration.
In the case of various types of supermarket pickles on the shelf, the pickling comes from vinegar. These vegetables, however, are not naturally fermented. Vinegar pickling and the subsequent high heat pressure canning, kills all the negative bacteria as well as the beneficial bacteria, enzymes and nutrients. Our industrialized food system favors vinegar pickles because the resulting product is stable at room temperature and can last for years on the shelf.
Why should I eat lacto-fermented foods?

As I’ve discussed in earlier articles, acid reflux disease or GERD happens when the stomach returns its contents back up the esophagus. During normal digestion, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle (LES) open to allow food to travel down to the stomach and closes to stop food and stomach acid from flowing back up the esophagus. GERD happens when the LES is weak or relax when it shouldn’t which allow the contents of the stomach to flow back into the esophagus. Heartburn is the what you feel from the “reflux” of the stomach acid backing up into the esophagus. How do we prevent this from happening?

I have long been a proponent of eating breakfast. When discussing the topic with patients I always mention a study that concluded that those skip breakfast are 80% more likely to become obese than those who do eat breakfast.
From what I have read from studies, and what I have observed anecdotally, breakfast sets the stage for how we feel throughout the day. Eating breakfast can affect concentration, focus, energy levels, food cravings, and more throughout the day. Eating breakfast can set us up for having a lethargic, hum drum day or having a high energy, feel good day.
Skipping breakfast will cause the body to go into a starvation state. It will extend the fast from nighttime through to the next meal. This can cause the body to prepare for an upcoming fast. When a body is preparing for a fast, whatever food you eat will be stored as fat to prepare for starvation. So whatever food you eat after fasting all night will be stored as fat instead of burned for energy.
For every point there is a counter point. One of the cool aspects of the human body is that everyone is so different.

While this type of system is often more expensive to run, there are many different factors affecting its running costs. And, unlike their gas-powered cousins, electric systems can accommodate air conditioning installations using their existing blower motors and ductwork. This makes them a clear winner for homes located in areas with excessively hot summer temperatures.
When it comes to cost, an HVAC system's hardware is one of the leading factors in the cost of running it. Different manufacturers, models, and system sizes all utilize different amounts of energy. And some systems that are rated Energy Star compliant use less energy than systems that aren't.
The HVAC system's ductwork located under your house or in the attic space is responsible for moving around all of the heated or cooled air. Since the air can be cooled or warmed by the outdoor temperature, it must be well insulated and all of its connections must be sealed tight with duct tape.
The insulation in your home determines how much heat transfer happens between indoors and the outside. The more winter heat and summer cooling you lose to the outdoors, then the more your HVAC system will need to run to keep your family comfortable.

Next, use Metagross's magnetic reversal, hpefully flip heads, if not i have Warp Point, evolve omanyte, primal swirl. TGW, hopefully win, and my opponent hopefully won't be able to win from there.
he has 11 basics so he will get more basics so no donk. warp points for the win.
since primal swirl works only on the bench, i just warp point the defending pokemon if its an evolution.
i think u need maintence. when your kabutops die, u want them back i suppose.
oh sorry, u might want 2 anyways, for other stuff.
This deck is suppose to be a quick deck, so i don't need to use more than 1 NM.
why do u play 3 helix fossils??
My advice: Replace two or three Team Galactic's with draw cards of your choice (probably Steven's). Take out one Helix, one Oak's, and put in two water energies. I think you're a little short on energy. If you took out a third TGW, give yourself one more water.

Why do some paperclips move more slowly? What is a different liquid you could test? Would using a different type of glass have the same affect?
During this experiment, you are testing to see how different liquids impact magnetic attraction. Depending on the type of liquid, it may cause the paper clip to have more resistance depending on how thick the consistency is. In every scenario, the paper clip is still attracted to the magnet, but the consistency of the liquid will have an affect on how fast or slow the paper clip is able to move throughout it.

The Earth’s gravity pulls on the ball as it moves upward, causing it to slow down until it comes to a momentary stop at its highest point. Then it will begin to move downward, speeding up as it does. Suppose, then, that you were to shine a flashlight upward. What would happen? You might argue that gravity would pull on the photons, causing them to slow down, but we know that light has a constant speed, and can’t slow down. You might argue that since photons are massless gravity doesn’t affect them, but we know that the Earth’s mass, like any other mass, can cause light to change directions. So neither of these can be the answer. The real answer is pretty interesting, and it turns out to be one of the tests of Einstein’s theory of relativity.
To understand what happens to our beam of light, we need to look at gravity in a slightly different way. Normally we think of gravity as a force, but it can also be described in terms of energy. If you take a mass and drop it, it speeds up as it falls, thus gaining kinetic energy. When you toss a ball in the air, it slows down, thus losing kinetic energy. But energy is conserved, so energy gained or lost by the ball has to come from or go somewhere. This energy is typically called gravitational potential energy, since gravity has the potential to

As your energy drops, you start getting tired. If it drops significantly, your performance in the game will also drop. Below 50% you risk injuring yourself if you remain in the game. Reaching 0% energy in game will cause an automatic injury.

Energy is recovered in four ways.
If you do not play in a game, you recover by 10%.
If you do play in the game but only as a pinch-hitter or defensive sub, when the game is over you can recover anywhere between 0% and 9% energy, depending on how much you played and how high your stamina skill is.
You can elect to not hire a trainer (or fire your current trainer) which will cause you to recover 5% energy instead of training your skills. There is no cost for this as you are basically resting, and it has the added benefit of giving you a small boost to morale.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Dolphin Therapy refers to a type of treatment for people with and without disabilities by using dolphin interaction as an attempt to rectify or lessen the disability.
Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure. Similar to the effect of music therapy, some researches have suggested that the sounds dolphins emit through their whistles and clicks help produce these changes.

Solar panels have a rating based on how much DC power it produces under standard test conditions, which just happens to be 1000 watts of sunlight per square meter of surface. But if you’re not at the equator at noon on a sunny day without cloud cover, your solar panels will never function ideally. The average solar panel produces about 200 watts of electricity. This varies from solar panel to solar panel based on the size and efficiency of the panel. What will actually determine the amount of energy a solar panel produces is the solar panel efficiency, solar panel size, and the amount of sunlight hitting the panel.
Shade, the direction and angle your solar panels are facing, and the surrounding temperature will affect how efficient solar panels will be. Panels placed in shaded areas will receive less sunlight and thus produce less energy. Temperatures above 77o F decrease the efficiency of a solar panel. And if you want your solar panels to absorb the most amount of sunlight, they must be placed at an angle of 10-60 degrees facing south, west, or east.
The average size of an installed solar panel system is 5kW. On a sunny day, it should produce 5000 watts of power per hour. Larger solar panel systems will absorb more sunlight and produce more power and the opposite is true for smaller solar panel systems.

Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes.

Ahhh, wouldn’t it be nice to always be around familiar surroundings and never had to deal with bad weather? No. Actually it wouldn’t because you would never get anywhere, as in, you never become more. You never improve if you never are challenged. The more you struggle, the stronger you become is only true if you endure. If you quit the only thing that happens is repeated mistakes because there is no learning. Get it? Improvement takes effort.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Well-timed rains and moderate summer temperatures have the Chicago area headed for an impressive display of fall colors.
Barring unexpected changes in the weather over the next two months, vivid displays are likely in all but the northernmost sections of the Midwest, where severe drought may lead to less intense colors while encouraging leaves to fall from trees earlier than usual.
These are the views of two of this area's most respected plant scientists and veteran observers of the region's fall color scene.
Both experts anticipate an especially generous helping of reds in this year's color arsenal if sunny, warm days and cool but largely frost-free nights dominate between now and the color peak. That peak around here is likely to arrive the third or fourth week of October--later than in years past when earlier mid-October color peaks were more common.
The Morton Arboretum's chief scientist, Gary Watson, says that more than the weather, shorter days and longer nights this time of year have the largest impact on the annual explosion of color in foliage. Environmental factors, including plant genetics, rainfall and the nutrients available to trees, all impact the seasonal color change. But, when it comes right down to it, the seasonal shift in sunlight intensity and the arrival of shorter days and longer nights prove most critical in encouraging leaves to cut back on, and ultimately stop, the production of chlorophyll, which produces the leaves' characteristic green color. When chlorophyll is reduced and finally eliminated, as happens when days shorten,

How much thought have you given to that, though? I have to admit I haven’t thought of it from that perspective before.
Maybe we should be, though. In short, as you run, your lower leg muscles fatigue more quickly than your upper leg muscles.

"The Eocene fossil record of bats (Chiroptera) includes four genera known from relatively complete skeletons: Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx. Phylogenetic relationships of these taxa to each other and to extant lineages of bats were investigated in a parsimony analysis of 195 morphological characters, 12 rDNA restriction site characters, and one character based on the number of R-1 tandem repeats in the mtDNA d-loop region. Results indicate that Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx represent a series of consecutive sister-taxa to extant microchiropteran bats. This conclusion stands in contrast to previous suggestions that these fossil forms represent either a primitive grade ancestral to both Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera (e.g., Eochiroptera) or a separate clade within Microchiroptera (e.g., Palaeochiropterygoidea). A new higher-level classification is proposed to better reflect hypothesized relationships among Eocene fossil bats and extant taxa. Critical features of this classification include restriction of Microchiroptera to the smallest clade that includes all extant bats that use sophisticated echolocation (Emballonuridae + Yinochiroptera + Yangochiroptera), and formal recognition of two more inclusive clades that encompass Microchiroptera plus the four fossil genera. Comparisons of results of separate phylogenetic analyses including and subsequently excluding the fossil taxa indicate that inclusion of the fossils changes the results in two ways: (1) altering perceived relationships among extant forms at a few poorly supported nodes; and (2) reducing perceived support for some nodes near the base of the tree. Inclusion of the fossils affects some character polarities (hence slightly changing tree topology), and also changes the levels at which transformations

It depends! Our team arrives on site as soon as possible to assess the damage. The time that it will take to completely dry the property depends on the size and scope of the loss. Other factors that also affect the drying time include the type of water damage, how long the water sits for, and the type of materials affected. The typical drying period takes around 2-3 days. However, this may be shorter or longer depending on the severity of the situation.
What happens and what are the effects when water floods my property?
First, when water contacts drywall, the paint begins to bubble and peel. After that, the water starts to saturate the insulation behind the drywall.
Next, if the water remains on your property for an extended period of time, the wood structures will begin to swell. The longer the water sits there, the more damage it will cause. Wood exposed to long-term water damage rots.

Although the cooler weather is a chance to relax indoors around a warm fire, the shorter daylight hours can affect some people with a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD. SAD is a depressive disorder that is directly related to the loss of sunlight in the fall and winter months. The symptoms can look just like depression: difficulty getting out of bed, overeating, and lack of energy can all be connected to it. There could also be a decrease in activity, trouble keeping focused, and irritability.
Since SAD was identified as a disorder, many research studies were conducted to find treatments. One of the best solutions was to trick the brain into thinking it is still receiving ample doses of sunlight by using phototherapy devices like dawn simulators – lamps that turn on as the sun comes up providing exposure to its strong bulbs for 30 minutes each morning. Light therapy boxes for SAD treatment are also known as light boxes, bright light therapy boxes and phototherapy boxes. Light therapy treatments involve 20 to 60 minutes of daily exposure to cool-white florescent light and there are many products on the market for this purpose.
You can combine two treatments for SAD by getting outside whenever it’s sunny and getting some exercise. Natural light boosts levels of serotonin, a mood-regulating

Solar panels have a rating based on how much DC power it produces under standard test conditions, which just happens to be 1000 watts of sunlight per square meter of surface. But if you’re not at the equator at noon on a sunny day without cloud cover, your solar panels will never function ideally. The average solar panel produces about 200 watts of electricity. This varies from solar panel to solar panel based on the size and efficiency of the panel. What will actually determine the amount of energy a solar panel produces is the solar panel efficiency, solar panel size, and the amount of sunlight hitting the panel.
Shade, the direction and angle your solar panels are facing, and the surrounding temperature will affect how efficient solar panels will be. Panels placed in shaded areas will receive less sunlight and thus produce less energy. Temperatures above 77o F decrease the efficiency of a solar panel. And if you want your solar panels to absorb the most amount of sunlight, they must be placed at an angle of 10-60 degrees facing south, west, or east.
The average size of an installed solar panel system is 5kW. On a sunny day, it should produce 5000 watts of power per hour. Larger solar panel systems will absorb more sunlight and produce more power and the opposite is true for smaller solar panel systems.

Irrigation Systems technology has come a long way from its early days, when installers dropped pipe haphazardly into the ground, figuring that spraying large volumes of water around would make up for a hit-or-miss installation. Today, we know that water is a precious resource, requiring careful management. A modern irrigation system with precise hydraulic calculation, accurate water disbursement and detailed programming will protect your landscape investment while conserving resources. A properly coordinated lawn irrigation system with quality components can cost more up front, but pays for itself in reduced maintenance and water costs in a few short years.
Your sprinkler system needs to be winterized before the cold weather comes to prevent the water inside the system from freezing and cracking the pipes, valves and sprinkler heads. Because the repairs from freeze damage can be very costly, we recommend that you have your system winterized by a NJ State licensed irrigation professional.

ONE: We talked about volcanoes before. Those volcanoes have lava vesicles (the tubes that bring lava to the surface). When those vesicles cool, sometimes holes remain. Those holes are like tubes that go directly into the bedrock. Weather, water, and heat/cold can get in those vesicles and affect the bedrock.
TWO: When any type of earthquake happens, sometimes faults develop. Those faults are cracks in the surface and in the bedrock. Wherever there is a way in, the weather will get inside and start eroding the bedrock.
THREE: You already know that the Earth is always moving. When stress on the land happens, small joints can occur. Joints are tiny cracks in the land. They aren't big like a fault. They are small cracks sometimes created by folding on the surface.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing.

Other than the Stamina Ratings, the other thing that affects performance during the game is fatigue. Fatigue only occurs within each game and is accumulated as the player plays. The bigger the play, the more fatigued he will be. Fatigue is recovered by sitting out some plays. Fatigue is not accumulated over the season, so if a player is fatigued in one game, he will be refreshed for the next game.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Hypothesis: Gracilaria will experience higher rates of bleaching (or loss of color) in fresh water because this is not its normal environmental conditions.
Samples are stored in well plates during the duration of the experiment.
Every day samples are examined and scored meaning samples are given a rating of how healthy they appear to be.
To the left, Aaron records his daily observations in a chart with all the samples listed.
After examining, most samples appeared healthy when exposed to lower salinities after Day 1 or Day 2 (Score 1). Day 4 samples appeared okay (Score = 2). However by Day 6, some samples began bleaching (turning lighter green, bleaching) and appeared unhealthy, therefore were given a score of 3.
Bleaching occurs in fresh water (0ppt). Some bleaching occurs in samples exposed 5ppt. Not much bleaching happens in the upper salinities (10-30ppt).
Because samples do not appear unhealthy when exposed to salinities of 10-30ppt, Aaron will be using a method to hopefully gain more insight on the health of these samples! He will be using PAM to measure how much the samples are photosynthesizing which indicates how healthy the plants are after going through this assay. The amount each sample can photosynthesize may change depending on the salinity conditions.

Mr Clinton made the apology in Guatemala City during his current four-nation visit to central America. It followed the publication last month of the findings of the independent Historical Clarification Commission which concluded that the US was responsible for most of the human rights abuses committed during the 36-year war in which 200,000 people died.
The remarks came as the US declassified thousands of documents made available to the commission which tell how the US initiated and sustained a murderous war conducted by Guatemalan security forces against civilians suspected of aiding leftwing guerrilla movements.

Hyperplasia happens when there’s an increase in the number of cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast.
When hyperplasia occurs in the ducts it’s called ductal hyperplasia. Ductal hyperplasia can be either ‘usual’ or ‘atypical’.
When hyperplasia occurs in the lobules it’s called atypical lobular hyperplasia.
Atypical hyperplasia is when cells lining the ducts or lobules increase in number and also develop an unusual pattern or shape. ‘Atypical’ means ‘not typical’.
Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) occurs in the ducts; atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) occurs in the lobules.
Atypical hyperplasia is benign (not cancer). However, having atypical hyperplasia has been shown to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in some people.
Hyperplasia usually develops naturally as the breast changes with age. It’s more common in women over 35, but can affect women of any age.
Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia can also affect men, but this is very rare.
As hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia don’t usually cause any symptoms they’re usually found by chance when breast tissue that has been removed during a biopsy or breast surgery is examined under a microscope in the laboratory.
Usual ductal hyperplasia does not usually need any treatment or follow-up.

According to the latest report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the national homeless population held pretty much steady from 2011 to 2012, which is good or bad, depending on how you look at it.
What's needed to turn things around, says Mark Johnston, acting assistant housing secretary for community planning and development, is money -- big money. Nearly $2 billion a year worth of big money.
As it happens, that's about the same amount Americans spend annually on Christmas decorations and flowers. Or so says the advocacy group ThinkProgress.
There will be some, I suppose, who will view this as a declaration of war on Christmas (a battle our friends at Fox News seem willing to wage every year at this time).

There are so many things that could be causing you to snore. Before you look into the different treatments available, it helps to know exactly what is causing the problem.
Everybody is different and what causes one person to snore might not be the cause of the next person’s snoring. Therefore it’s vital that you visit your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to see where the problem lies.
Sometimes it could be a mixture of the above that’s causing you to snore.
When you smoke, it tends to irritate the lining within the nasal cavities. It can also cause the throat to swell up. Once this happens the airflow is restricted and that leads to snoring. The more you smoke, the higher the chance that you’ll start to snore. It’s recommended that if you can’t cut down completely, you have your last cigarette roughly 4 hours before you go to bed. This will give the irritation time to settle down.

About Website Pagination and how use of pagination in a website affects its seo?
Pagination refers to the practice of segmenting links or dividing content into multiple pages affecting SEO, web development as well as the experience of users. Website pagination is a common navigation technique used for web development especially on e-commerce sites.
● Article pagination occurs when an article spans across to more than one page.
● Forum pagination occurs where different threads span across many pages.
● Category pagination occurs when different listings (either products or anything that can be categorized) span over more than one page.
Segmenting a piece of content into several pages splits crucial index properties such as the anchor text data, social media shares, and incoming links. This directly affects the website rankings on the search engines since the strength of the page is divided across the series hence doesn’t increase website traffic.
When using website pagination, most of the pages will tend to have similar content with the same Meta title and description across the pages. This is common when paginating a list of articles or products. When the pages lack enough content for the entries, they result to duplicated content. This effect is stronger with online stores where they use advanced filtering features when displaying products.
The quality of content on paginated pages is normally very low. With such poor quality content on a website lie penalties from the Panda algorithm. However, Google has clear website SEO tips on practices that are best for website pagination.

Retrieved Text: For menopausal women, progesterone can be a difficult hormone to understand. Because it exists in a delicate balance with estrogen, it can cause several problems when your hormones go haywire. Many times, women face lower levels of all hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But what happens when levels of this hormone become too high? Keep reading to find out how to recognize high progesterone levels and how to treat them.
What Causes High Progesterone Levels?
Naturally, women should experience increased levels of progesterone during ovulation and pregnancy. However, when many middle aged women reach menopause, their reproductive years are part of the past. During menopause, high progesterone levels are usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This occurs when there is a drastic drop in estrogen production, causing progesterone dominance. High progesterone levels can also be the result of sedentary life and an imbalanced diet.
What Are the Symptoms of High Progesterone?
Increased progesterone levels often have signs and symptoms such as muscle fatigue, drowsiness, and mood swings. In addition, this condition can affect your sexual health by causing vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Emotionally, you may be more prone to anxiety and depression.
Other less common symptoms of high progesterone can affect your physical appearance. In excessive amounts, this hormone can cause oily skin, acne, and weight gain. It can also affect your excretory system, causing urinary tract infections and incontinence.
How Can I Treat Progesterone Imbalance?
There are dietary and lifestyle changes you can make to lessen the uncomfortable effects of high progesterone levels. One recommended treatment is to

Instead of having higher monthly payments and excessive fees, a lease may provide for more cash flow and additional flexibility for returning the vehicle at the end of the lease term. However, if the owner dies while leasing, what happens to the vehicle and the contract obligations may surprise you. It is important to understand that just because the lessee dies, it does not mean the contract automatically terminates when you drive to the dealer to drop off the keys and surrender the car.
First, the lease should be reviewed to determine the payment responsibilities. Often times, the terms will provide specific information about what happens if the responsible party dies and if death is deemed to be an “early termination” under the contract. The financial obligations typically remain, which means the personal representative of the deceased’s estate is responsible to work with the dealer to satisfy the debt. Also, there may be a co-signer on the lease, which will affect the estate’s actions.
It is recommended to consult with an attorney to determine if the estate may be liable for the remaining monthly payments, or if an agreement can be reached between the parties. The contract may have additional language regarding fees to process repossession paperwork, cutting new keys, or reconditioning charges for excessive wear and tear. Further, the dealer may impose costs for any deficiency between the remaining payments and the resale of the vehicle to another buyer or

For many Americans, pancakes evoke a certain kind of nostalgia. People make pancakes because they're delicious, crowd-pleasing, and easy. Well, sort of easy. There are a few crucial mistakes that home chefs commonly make when cooking this classic morning dish. We chatted with senior associate food editor Claire Saffitz and test kitchen contributor Alfia Muzio about pancakes woes, and how to avoid them.
1. Using Crappy/Old Flour, Butter, Etc.
For something as subtle as pancakes, the quality of your ingredients is extremely important—even the baking soda, which is responsible for making pancakes fluffy. Your baking soda should be less than 6 months old—or else it won't do its job, which is to increase the volume of the pancake when it hits the hot pan. For wet ingredients, we love buttermilk. Its acids react with the baking soda, giving your pancakes even more lift and imparting a subtle tang. If you only have milk at your disposal, add a squeeze of lemon to it before mixing into your dry ingredients—the acidity is important in balancing your pancakes' flavors.
Lumps are actually okay! Stir your batter until the dry and wet ingredients are just incorporated. That means mixing until the flour streaks have disappeared, but leaving the pesky lumps. If you over-mix, the gluten will develop from the flour in your batter, making your pancakes chewy instead of fluffy.
No! You can't make your batter the night before, or even an hour before you make your pancakes. It all

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

New rules are now in place governing what happens when somebody dies without a will.
Under the old rules, the deceased’s spouse (or civil partner) had to share the estate with the deceased’s surviving parents or siblings, as long as there were no children involved.
The new rules mean that the deceased’s spouse or civil partner will inherit everything, or if they have children they will share the estate with the children.
This means the children of a deceased person who was married could receive far less than they would have done under the old rules. It also means that parents could inherit nothing at all.
Surprisingly, the position remains the same for co-habitees, who still have absolutely no protection regardless of whether or not they have children together.
The changes to the law highlight how important it is to have a will in place to ensure that your assets are distributed as you would want them to be.

There are many estate planning tools available in Wisconsin to individuals who want to transfer property without going through the formal probate process. One such tool is a transfer on death (TOD) deed. As the name suggests, this is a deed to real property that names a beneficiary who becomes owner upon the original owner’s death.

What Happens to My Business After I Die?
Most people only think about estate planning in terms of their personal assets, but what if you own or co-own a business? How does death affect the business? More importantly, what kind of business succession planning do you have in place to deal with your sudden or unexpected death?
Perhaps not surprisingly, most Wisconsin business owners have not done any succession planning. Some people assume the business simply dies with them. Depending on how you structured your business, however, that is not necessarily true. Even if the business is simply you, and you never created any separate legal entity, there will inevitably be certain matters that need to be wound down upon your death.
When you are creating a will or revocable trust as part of your estate plan, you need to think carefully before selecting someone to act as a personal representative or trustee.

The battery pack in an EV does not. It's called a "floating" system, which is completely electrically isolated from the chassis. In fact, some components, such as the speed controller and charger, will not function if they detect a current path to the chassis, even in milliamps.
The EV also has various safety disconnects built in. These include a main contactor, a circuit breaker, and fusible links. All of these can be used to manually disarm the battery pack circuit, or they operate automatically in the case of tool dropped across battery terminals, collision damage, or some other situation that causes a surge of current.
It's perfectly safe to drive an EV in the rain.

Batteries Explained (A little bit).
As simply as possible, these are the common types of battery and what those numbers and letters mean.
MAH, AMP, AND VOLTAGE MAKE A DIFFERENCE TOO.
The lower the resistance of the build the more power is drawn from a battery (expressed in Amps). The higher the power draw, the more mAh used in a given cycle (each time you take a puff). A higher milliamp rated battery will provide a longer runtime but runtime is always dependent on the load placed on the battery. A 10a draw will deplete a battery much faster than a 1a draw.
MAH, AMP AND VOLTAGE IN SHORT.
mAh is the capacity rating of the cell.
Voltage is the difference in electrical potential between two points (the + and – ends of the battery) and is commonly expressed as the ‘Nominal’ voltage of the cell (3.7v for Lithium chemistry cells).
Amps is the amount of current.
THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE CHARGERS WITH THE DIFFERENT BATTERIES.
The best way to ensure that your batteries are charging safely is to always use the manufacturer’s charging cable or dock that came with your vape device. If in doubt consult the support team.

mAh stands for milliamp-hour. For our purposes, it describes the total amount of energy that a battery can deliver over an hour. For example, a battery with a rated capacity of 3000mAh could deliver 3000 milliamperes — or 3 amps — for one hour before it is exhausted. Using Ohm’s Law If you’re

Today’s motive power battery is designed and built to give anywhere from 1000 to 2000 operations / charge cycles, depending on the application and the operating environment. If such a battery were to complete one cycle per workday, the life expectancy would be between 4 to 8 years.
Exactly how much life a battery will provide depends to a great extent on how well you take care of your battery. The following battery maintenance procedures, properly carried out at the proper time, will go a long way toward prolonging the life of the battery and making it more efficient.
Three testing instruments are required to check batteries accurately and efficiently: a voltmeter, hydrometer, and thermometer. The specific gravity and open circuit voltage readings are normally in direct proportion to each other; therefore, a voltmeter or hydrometer can be used to check the battery. The use of the voltmeter is a faster method of approximating the individual cell state of charge, and can reduce dramatically the time required for routine battery checking.
When using the voltmeter method of battery checking, take specific gravity readings on the two cells having the highest and lowest voltage readings. This will confirm both cells’ state of charge and accurately pinpoint the difference in the state of charge between them. The voltmeter is used when on–charge or on–discharge voltage readings are needed.
A battery thermometer is read like a normal thermometer. A proper thermometer should have specific gravity correction marked on its scale. The hydrometer has an extra–long scale

What is a “Chassis” Battery?
If you do not own a motorhome then you don’t have to worry about chassis aka “Start” batteries. The chassis or “Start” battery system may consist of one or more batteries whose sole purpose is to start the engine in your motorhome. Gas engines typically will have one battery and diesel engines will use two or more chassis batteries. These batteries are designed to provide instant high amperage output to turn over and start up the engine.
What is a “House” Battery?
All RV’s have at least one “House” battery. Depending on the size and type of your RV, “House” battery banks can use 4 or more batteries. RV house batteries are known as “Deep Cycle” type batteries.

Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery technology is one of the fastest growing trends within the tool community, and certainly for good reason. Lithium Ion batteries have the best energy to weight ratio, meaning they pack the most power using the smallest quantity of bulk. Additionally they experience no memory effect or, lazy battery effect. This happens when custom lithium ion battery packs can no longer accept a maximum charge for having been repeatedly recharged without having to be fully used (a common symptom of Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) batteries). Li-Ion batteries, conversely, have simply no memory and can continually accept a maximum charge. Additionally, Lithium Ion batteries have got a slow rate of charge loss while the battery is disengaged.
What exactly is the difference between Lithium Batteries and Lithium Ion Batteries? The difference is incorporated in the chemistry; a Lithium battery is really a disposable source of energy composed of lithium metal compounds – the true secret word, here, being disposable; Lithium batteries cannot be recharged. Lithium Ion batteries, on the other hand, are intercalated, meaning the lithium ion in the battery moves between two internal electrodes. This movement, or reversibility in the lithium ion accounts for the battery’s rechargeability.
What are the benefits associated with Lithium Ion Technology? Lithium Ion batteries hold lots of power and they are surprisingly light-weight, particularly with consideration to many other rechargeable batteries. Li-Ion batteries combine single cell technology

How to dispose off an obsolete solar battery?
Once a solar battery is dead, the proper thing to do is to disconnect it from the solar system and dispose it properly.
It is not recommended to connect the old battery with a new battery because this will cause problems.
When disposing off used solar batteries, it is important to keep them in separate plastic bags.
Even though the battery might not be able to power your device anymore, it may still have a little power left inside, which may cause them to leak or explode when jammed together.

The L-A batteries are the more common types of batteries. They are equally more prone to leaks than the NiCad batteries.
Whichever types of battery your solar system has, it is important to properly dispose them whenever its lifespan expires or when it damages.
Proper disposal is essential to keep these batteries out of the environment on the expiration of their lifespan. Fortunately, unlike some consumer products, these batteries can be recycled and used to produce other solar batteries.
What options are available for solar battery disposal?

However, LiPo batteries are not perfect. Although they are lighter, LiPo batteries are also more prone to mechanical damage. Much like any other battery, they also have limited lifespans. Just how long can a LiPo battery last? Is there any way to make them last longer?
How long can I expect my LiPo battery to last?
Most LiPo batteries are not rated to last longer than 300 charge cycles. A whole charge cycle in this context is defined as a full battery being drained to empty and charged to full capacity again. However, measuring a LiPo battery’s lifespan may not be practical, as batteries go through varying depths of discharge when they are used.
Many manufacturers have stated that their LiPo batteries will last 2 or 3 years. This is a somewhat realistic approximation for a scenario where a battery is regularly used and charged around 2 or 3 times a week. However, battery replacement based on a date stamp might not apply to all scenarios, as it does not take into account the level of usage.
In any case, a LiPo battery is considered to start “aging” the first day that it is activated. This is applicable whether the battery is under regular use or is stored for a more extended period. How a LiPo battery’s performance deteriorates during storage is determined by its storage conditions, as we shall cover in more detail

The death of the battery is also the death of the vehicle (at least until you purchase a replacement battery), which is why care and maintenance of the battery system are very crucial. RV battery life expectancy varies from situation to situation, but if you know how to care for your vehicle’s power source, you can expect it to last for years and years.
Let's get started to understand the basic and other important aspects first, before going to the main topic!
If you are to maintain and prolong the life of your trailer’s batteries, you need to possess some basic knowledge and understanding of how batteries work. For RVs, lead-acid batteries are the norm. These guys are composed of multiple cells connected in a series. Each of the cells can produce around 2.1 volts, which means a 12v battery with 6 cells put together in series will be able to generate an output voltage of 12.6v.
Keep in mind that batteries do not produce electricity. They act as a power source in some way, but their primary design is for storing electricity and not generating them. Yes, they can produce electricity, but only if they are already holding the charge in the first place.

Stocks are basically 'shares' of a company. It is ownership in the most literal sense: you get a piece of every desk, filing cabinet, contract and sale in the company. Better yet, you own a slice of every rupee of profit that comes through the door. The more shares you buy, the bigger your stake in the company.
Stocks are the means by which companies obtain additional financing for their businesses - by selling off parts of their company to investors. The price of a stock can vary tremendously, from less than a rupee of a share, to a few thousand rupees a share!
How is the price of a stock determined?
It's all about the company's earnings. Suppose you own a company which makes Rs. 1,000 in profits every year. How much would you be willing to sell the entire company for? Say you ask for Rs. 10,000. Would anyone buy it?
To a potential buyer, he will assess his situation with this question, "How much return can I get if I invested my money somewhere else?"
If he buys your company at Rs. 10,000, he is essentially investing in a vehicle that can generate 10% returns a year. If he can't find that kind of return somewhere else, he will pay your Rs. 10,000 asking price. If he can, then he won't. You might have to lower your asking price.

Because it exists in a delicate balance with estrogen, it can cause several problems when your hormones go haywire. Many times, women face lower levels of all hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But what happens when levels of this hormone become too high? Keep reading to find out how to recognize high progesterone levels and how to treat them.
What Causes High Progesterone Levels?
Naturally, women should experience increased levels of progesterone during ovulation and pregnancy. However, when many middle aged women reach menopause, their reproductive years are part of the past. During menopause, high progesterone levels are usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This occurs when there is a drastic drop in estrogen production, causing progesterone dominance. High progesterone levels can also be the result of sedentary life and an imbalanced diet.
What Are the Symptoms of High Progesterone?
Increased progesterone levels often have signs and symptoms such as muscle fatigue, drowsiness, and mood swings. In addition, this condition can affect your sexual health by causing vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Emotionally, you may be more prone to anxiety and depression.
Other less common symptoms of high progesterone can affect your physical appearance. In excessive amounts, this hormone can cause oily skin, acne, and weight gain. It can also affect your excretory system, causing urinary tract infections and incontinence.
How Can I Treat Progesterone Imbalance?
There are dietary and lifestyle changes you can make to lessen the uncomfortable effects of high progesterone levels. One recommended treatment is to

Energy efficiency rates three factors: solar heat gain, non-solar heat transmission (the "U factor"), and airflow. The non-solar heat loss happens by way of conduction, convection, and radiation through your window. Solar heat gains come from the sun shining into your home. Airflow happens intentionally when you open the window or unintentionally, which is called infiltration or leakage.
A sliding window is one type of sash style. The materials your window is made from and the sash style affect the above three factors. Generally, wood, vinyl, or fiberglass frames are better insulators than aluminum or other metals, so choose sliding windows in these materials. The number of panes of glass, what fills the space between them, and the coating on the glass all affect the energy efficiency so sliding windows with a lower U factor will be more energy efficient.
Horizontal sliding windows usually provide minimal ventilation with an effective open area of 45 percent, which may make cooling a home naturally a bit less effective. Sliding windows can also be leaky, and leakage can be responsible for up to 10 percent of a home's energy usage. The lower the air leakage rating on the label, the better.

In order to provide findings in manageable chunks, we will focus on the community highlights as they relate to two performance indices: Contributed Revenue and Total Expenses.
How do socio-demographic characteristics of the community affect Contributed Revenue?
The larger the percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree or higher, the lower unrestricted contributed revenue.
As commute time increases, unrestricted contributed revenue decreases.
Contributed revenue is boosted by a high percentage of the population 18-24 years old and elevated levels of independent artists living in the community.
Households led by single moms, nonfamily households, and those with annual income above $200,000 all lead to higher unrestricted contributed revenue.

Circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycle that our bodies use as an internal clock, establish our wake/sleep cycle. Research has shown that acute (extremely heavy) or chronic (two or more drinks a day) alcohol consumption causes circadian disturbances that affect sleep, mood, and other daily biological rhythms, including body temperature, blood pressure, and hormone secretion. Many genes involved in this process have been identified and mapped.
Lowered mRNA from these genes is a sign of lowered gene activity and lowered protein production, which is likely related to the sleep and mood disturbances seen in alcohol-dependent people.
The Taiwanese researchers showed that people who had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent were producing much lower amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA) from these genes. Messenger RNA is used as a blueprint from which genes manufacture proteins. Lowered mRNA from these genes is a sign of lowered gene activity and lowered protein production, which is likely related to the sleep and mood disturbances seen in alcohol dependent people.
While little is known about the proteins produced by circadian genes, the study shows that alcohol dependent individuals don't seem to be making as much of them as normal individuals do. And presumably, this affects how their biological clocks work.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

GERD happens when the LES is weak or relax when it shouldn’t which allow the contents of the stomach to flow back into the esophagus. Heartburn is the what you feel from the “reflux” of the stomach acid backing up into the esophagus. How do we prevent this from happening?

As a nation, we’ve come to our senses about the harmful effects of processed food. Knowledge of the benefits of real food has grown exponentially. But just because we are eating more raw and organic food, does that mean our pets should be eating it just as much? How can we be sure our pets get all their nutrition without all the added benefits in one product?
The answer is simple and it relates directly to the answer we give ourselves: we lived just fine (or better) before processed foods, and we can live without them now. The biggest risk in processed food for our pets is that we can’t be sure what has been added to them such as chemicals, preservatives, fertilizers, hormones and pesticides. We have no idea how the food we feed our pets could be harming them. The only way to control that is to feed them organic food. Diet and lowered health risks are some of the reasons we’ve switched to organic, the same should go for your four-legged loved ones.

After all, it can be found in high amounts in some vegetables.
A recent animal study by Carlström et al. pins nitrate as a very important molecule central to metabolic homeostasis (open access here).
The authors discuss research supporting a defect in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and bioavailability as a potential link between symptoms of metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, weight gain, etc). They then highlight the recent work showing that nitrate is a substrate for NO synthesis (nitrate->nitrite->NO; for basic metabolism see this post), as well as being a long understood oxidation product of NO metabolism.
Experiment 1: Because eNOS gene disruption is known to cause metabolic syndrome in mice and humans (the major NO production pathway, up to 70%), mice deficient in eNOS were given nitrate acutely (intraperitoneally) and chronically (dietary via sodium nitrate) to verify if plasma and tissue levels of nitrite and nitrosylation products increased (the latter suggests some cGMP- a messenger mediating vasodilation- independent mechanisms). They did acutely but only at the tissue level chronically. The dose of sodium nitrate was 0.1 mmol/kg/day to make up for the eNOS deficiency (which consequent to diminishing NO production, slows

Have these effects changed since U.S. oil production has soared after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (see Figure).
Many argue that negative oil shocks should reduce output in oil-importing countries such as the U.S. or Japan. On the supply side, oil is a factor of production, and an exogenous decrease in oil supply will decrease productivity. Higher energy costs may also decrease capital formation and long run supply. On the demand side, the price elasticity of demand for oil is low and price increases will not cause spending on oil to fall much. Higher oil prices act as a tax on consumers and firms. As oil prices increase, they will reduce spending on other goods and services. In the energy sector, firms producing oil should benefit from higher prices.
The IMF (2014), using its G20 economic model, reported that oil price increases after the GFC would disrupt the macroeconomies of oil-importing countries.

When used in reference to chemotherapy, it describes the point when blood cell counts are at their lowest after a chemotherapy treatment. It is commonly referred to as the "nadir period" or simply "nadir" among healthcare workers and patients.
While chemotherapy directly targets cancer cells, it also affects our blood cells in the process -- red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These cells are manufactured in the bone marrow. During chemotherapy, bone marrow activity may be decreased, resulting in lowered blood cell counts within the body.
White blood cells (WBC) generally drop to their lowest count about 7 to 14 days after a chemotherapy treatment. When WBC are at their lowest count, people are at a heightened risk of developing infections. White blood cells are a vital component of the immune system, as they keep invading bacteria at bay. When the white blood cell count is too low, the immune system is compromised and cannot effectively fight infections.

The Indian Sports Betting Working Group (ISBWG) will look at how governments for tribes are legally operating under state and federal structures for regulation when it comes to adapting sports betting. The group will also look at how internet gambling can legally be worked into the gaming options that are available for gamblers.

Do you have any pointers I could use, to profit on Brexit?
Could you give an example scenario what can happen with international and domestic (to the UK) markets after Brexit?
I know it's a broad question, but hopefully, this will trigger a discussion that could be split into smaller, more specific questions.
Suppose there was a general consensus that GBP would depreciate against (say) EUR following Brexit.
Then suppose everyone sold GBP. At some point, GBP would fall below fair value as judged by actual commerce - e.g. you can buy British goods or services more cheaply than those sourced from the eurozone. People would likely start buying GBP to pay for them, pushing up the GBP.
Anticipating this, people might instead buy GBP to profit from the 'sheep', leading to an appreciation of the currency, against the initial consensus.
Bottom line: currency speculation is called speculation for good reason.

If, for whatever reason, you didn’t contribute towards paying back your doorstep loan one week, it could have a negative impact on your credit rating.
All loans and repayments are recorded in your credit file. Therefore missed repayments are reported to credit agencies as a missed repayment and could have a negative effect on your credit score. Missing repayments also puts you in arrears, which could mean you’re behind on your agreed payment schedule.
Communication is key to repayment difficulties. If you’re not going to be able to pay the amount you’re supposed to, ignoring it will only make the situation worse and you’ll still owe the money regardless.
The first thing you should do is talk to your lender; you might be surprised at how much they can help. They’ll often explain that if you are able to afford to pay a smaller amount you can avoid a missed payment going on your credit report, although it will be recorded that you’ve repaid a smaller amount.
What if you’ve already missed a payment on your loan?

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

There are also alternate modes for those who need a break from having a thundercloud in their home. For instance, Cloud can be turned into a nightlight or used to stream music via any Bluetooth-compatible device.

Each Cloud is approximately 28 x 14 x 13 inches (71 x 36 x 33 cm), but these measurements vary as each cloud is handmade and therefore unique.
Cloud costs US$3,360 for the smart version, which includes a wireless remote control unit, color-changing lights, 2.1 speakers (two speakers plus a subwoofer), and motion detection. The lamp version goes for $960, and features a Philips LED dimmable bulb but none of the extra gubbins.

We’re simply talking about the relationships between each of the features on a human face….phew!
When creating your caricature drawing, it’s important to have a standard to compare everything to.
In this chapter, Sycra will show you how to take a realistic face and exaggerate the features so it becomes a caricature.
So, if you’re ready, let’s get going and set out on the path to creating a successful caricature drawing!
In this example, Sycra has created a generic human face which he’ll use as a basis when exaggerating or over-emphasizing the features.
The example on the right shows the effect created by squishing the image vertically – notice how the forehead is now much larger and the face is thinner as a result?
In the next example, Sycra shows you what happens if you take things in another direction and squish the image horizontally – notice how the face is now wider but not as tall?
There’s a big difference between these two examples and this is a good way to demonstrate how adjusting or exaggerating the features in one area can affect the features in another – this is what Sycra means by the relationships between facial features.

Although there are no hard and fast rules about how often you should update your will, certain life changes, such as a divorce, will trigger a need to do so.
But what happens if you divorce and die before you’ve had a chance to change your will? Does your estranged ex-spouse get the property you previously willed to him or her while you were still in love?
In Texas, the answer is no. The Texas statutes provide that if, after making a will, the testator’s marriage is dissolved, either by divorce, annulment or a declaration that the marriage is void, all the provisions in the will, including all fiduciary appointments, shall be read as if the former spouse predeceased the testator.
So if you previously signed a will that gave all your worldly possessions to your spouse, and named him or her as the executor of your will, but then divorced, those you named as contingent beneficiaries would take under the will, and those you named as alternate fiduciaries (executors or trustees) would be called on to act.
Nevertheless, it is important that you update your will after your divorce to reflect your current wishes. Your will is something that should change as your life does. Otherwise it can become an outdated document that doesn’t accomplish your goals or protect the loved-ones you leave behind.
Suppose you were married over 50 years and decided you want your ex-spouse to still inherit everything? Can you rewrite your will to that effect?

Good blood sugar control can help prevent or slow the progression of some of the main medical complications of diabetes (, ).
For this reason, avoiding or minimizing foods that cause big blood sugar spikes is essential.
Despite being a healthy fruit, bananas are pretty high in both carbs and sugar, the main nutrients that raise blood sugar levels.
So, should you be eating bananas if you have diabetes? How do they affect your blood sugar?
If you have diabetes, being aware of the amount and type of carbs in your diet is important.
This is because carbs raise your blood sugar level more than other nutrients, which means they can greatly affect your blood sugar control.
When blood sugar rises in non-diabetic people, the body produces insulin. It helps the body move sugar out of the blood and into the cells where it's used or stored.
However, this process doesn't work as it should in diabetics. Instead, either the body doesn't produce enough insulin or the cells are resistant to the insulin that is made.
If not managed properly, this can result in high-carb foods causing big blood sugar spikes or constantly high blood sugar levels, both of which are bad for your health.
93% of the calories in bananas come from carbs. These carbs are in the form of sugar, starch and fiber (3).
A single medium-sized banana contains 14 grams of sugar and 6 grams of starch (3).

CCK is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system that helps stimulate the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin can be found in both the small intestines and the brain. CCK enables smooth absorption of fats and proteins in small intestines. Meanwhile in the brain, the satiety hormone is located in the hippocampus, which is the memory-forming region of the brain, explained Auriel Willette, Assistant Professor at the Iowa State University in the US.
The team looked at CCK in 287 people. For the study, the team used data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
“The regulation of when and how much we eat can have some association with how good our memory is – what we eat and what our body does with it affects our brain. It will hopefully help to shed further light on how satiety hormones in the blood and brain affect brain function,” Willette said.

Temperatures are rising as we come into the summer months and with this, the temperature of the wastewater also increases. As a result, aerobic bacteria become more active and begin digesting BOD and other nutrients at a faster rate. The warmer the water becomes, the more active they are and the more oxygen they consume. This results in low dissolved oxygen.
Low dissolved oxygen coupled with rising temperatures can lead to an increase in anoxic zones at the bottom of wastewater aeration basins. Anaerobic digestion releases sulphur dioxide, along with a variety of other noxious gases that are the causes of wastewater odour.
Odour is often a sign that more anaerobic digestion is occurring than there should be. Given that aerobic digestion is a much faster process than anaerobic digestion, it is likely that the wastewater is being under-treated.
When gases are released from wastewater treatment plants they result in a very pungent odour which will directly affect WWTP operators and, when carried by winds, to people who live or work nearby.
Increasing oxygen supply ensures that the aerobic bacteria have the oxygen they need to aerobically digest BOD. This will help to control odours as anaerobic digestion will slow down.
Ensuring dissolved oxygen is reaching the very bottom of an aeration basin is key to avoiding odour as this is where the odour-causing anaerobic digestion occurs. By circulating the wastewater effectively, you can create nearly equal dissolved oxygen throughout. This in turn will promote odour-free aerobic digestion.

Changes in exchange rates directly affect import prices.

The pass-through from exchange rates into import prices in the United States is estimated to be quite low, at around 30 percent, and this is often attributed to the fact that imports are mostly invoiced in U.S. dollars . In addition to this direct impact of exchange rates on import prices, there can also be an effect on domestic prices. Suppose that a stronger U.S. dollar means that cars imported from Japan will be cheaper for U.S. consumers. If domestic auto producers do not then reduce their U.S. prices they could lose market share. By how much do they adjust their prices? In this post, we draw on a new study —“International Shocks and Domestic Prices: How Large Are Strategic Complementarities?”—that uses micro-level data for Belgian firms to shed light on this question.
An exchange rate shock can affect domestic prices through two distinct channels. The first is a direct effect through the marginal cost channel, as the exchange rate alters the price of imported inputs. Continuing with our car industry example, a stronger U.S. dollar makes imported intermediate inputs—such as car parts, steel, and rubber—cheaper so the marginal cost of producing a car in the United States is lower.

Your stomach releases certain acids in response to the food you eat and that determines the pH level (the level of acidity or alkalinity in your stomach) which when not balanced can cause flatulence, indigestion, bacterial growth or gas. Most of these common stomach problems are basically due to low acid levels in your stomach. “Drinking additional water after fruits

For example, how fast water flows over the plates can drastically affect the ORP rating. Referred to as the flow rate, running your tap at full speed will make any ionized water system less effective, as the water is in contact with the ionizing plates for less time - allowing it to impact it to a lesser extent (1). Therefore, setting the faucet to a slower setting will produce higher ORP water and is recommended.
A second factor which affects the ability of any ionized water system to produce high ORP water, is the mineral content of the water in question. Tap water that has high mineral content is often referred to as “hard water”, whereas water with low mineral content is termed “soft water.” Where you live can determine whether your tap water is hard or soft, with higher mineral content making higher ORP water possible. How does this work?
Mineral content is the pathway through which ionization happens, by conducting the electric charge being produced by the plates (2). For this reason, more mineral content means more conduction and a higher ORP in the end.
While the above factors are important, with all else being equal, some ionized water system options are better than others. Continue onto the next

They may do this by breathalyzer test at the scene of the incident, or by blood test once you have been arrested. If your BAC level is measured at .08 or above, you will be charged with a Virginia DUI. However, with the help of a Virginia DUI attorney, you may fight your DUI charge.
One way you can fight your DUI charge is by challenging the evidence that the state has against you. There are factors in BAC readings that might affect the results of a test, such as your body weight, and the rate that alcohol is absorbed into your body's bloodstream. By raising the question of whether or not your BAC test was accurate, an attorney may convince a judge to dismiss your DUI charges.
How does my body weight affect a BAC reading?
Generally, the less you weigh, the more you will be affected by the consumption of alcohol. In other words, a lower body weight makes for a higher concentration of alcohol in the body. This is because the BAC in your body is measured as the total amount of alcohol divided by your total amount of body water. Therefore, someone who weighs less will generally have a lower amount of body water, which will have less of a dilutive effect on the alcohol in your system.

When you eat food that contains carbohydrates, the sugar (glucose) from the food breaks down during digestion and your blood glucose level rises. The speed at which the food is able to increase your blood glucose level is called the "glycemic response."
This glycemic response is influenced by many factors, including how much food you eat, how much the food is processed or even how the food is prepared.
Foods that raise your blood glucose level quickly have a higher GI rating than foods that raise your blood glucose level more slowly.
In general, the lower the rating, the better the quality of carbohydrate in terms of impact on your blood sugar and your health.
Not only do low GI foods raise your blood glucose more slowly and to a less dramatic peak than higher GI foods, but most low GI foods are all-around healthier choices. Low GI foods are usually low in calories and fat, while also being high in fibre, nutrients and antioxidants. Choosing low GI foods more often may help you increase levels of HDL (healthy) cholesterol in your blood and might help you control your appetite, as they tend to keep you feeling fuller, longer.

Echolocation has been established in several groups of mammals, such as bats (not all of them), dolphins, and whales, as well as a few species of shrews and two kinds of birds that use it for navigating through caves (cave swiflets and oilbirds).
Echolocation adds to the amazing diversity in nature, with bats and birds being able to occupy unique niches, and dolphins being able to develop a remarkable acuity in distinguishing even small objects.
The term echolocation was coined in 1944 by Donald Griffin, who was the first to conclusively demonstrate its existence in bats. Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in various environments.
Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal. Sonar (sound, navigation, and ranging) is a technology that uses sound propagation for navigation, communication, and detection. In animal echolocation, ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment.
Unlike some sonar that relies on an extremely narrow beam to localize a target, animal echolocation relies on multiple receivers. Echolocating animals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the two ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to

Dolphin-assisted therapy dates back to the 1950s with the work of Dr. John Lilly, who studied the effects of dolphins on individuals with disabilities. This treatment combines two elements that have demonstrated great promise in therapy with children: interaction with an animal and immersion in warm water. Typically, this treatment is combined with speech therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage.
Some therapists believe that, because they seem to enjoy spontaneous, nonverbal play and have a reputation for being both gentle and attentive, dolphins may be able to help motivate otherwise unresponsive people.
Theories range from a belief that individuals experience stimulation of the immune system when interacting with dolphins, thus promoting healing, to a belief that the individuals receive such joy and unconditional love from dolphins that they are more apt to experience recovery.
One of the most popular theories is that the dolphin’s use of sonar and echolocation produces changes in a person’s body tissue and cell structure.

Retrieved Text: The ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) has been introduced in London.
Here the Press Association looks at some of the key questions around the scheme.
The Ulez is a way of charging vehicles which emit the most nitrogen oxide for entering parts of London.
– When does it apply?
The daily charge runs from midnight to midnight every day.
– Where is it happening?
The scheme is initially within the same area as the congestion charging zone, before being expanded to within the North and South Circular roads from October 2021.
– What vehicles are included?
All vehicles are affected apart from black taxis.
– How much does it cost to enter the zone with an older vehicle?
It costs £12.50 for most vehicle types, including cars, motorcycles and vans. Heavier vehicles such as lorries, buses and coaches are liable for a £100 charge.
– How can I avoid the charge?
To be exempt from the Ulez charge, petrol cars, vans and minibuses must meet the Euro 4 emissions standard and diesels must meet Euro 6.
That means the oldest cars that can be driven in central London without paying are roughly a four-year-old diesel model or a 13-year-old petrol model.
– What happens if I don’t pay?
If you fail to pay the charge, car drivers face a £160 Penalty Charge Notice (reduced to £80 if paid within 14 days).
Lorry drivers will be handed a much larger fine of £1,000 (reduced to £500 if paid within 14 days).
– What if I don’t know my vehicle’s emissions standard?
Drivers can check whether their vehicle is liable for a charge by entering its registration

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Most bats are nocturnal, active around twilight hours. Three fourths of the world’s bat populations are insect eaters, helping to control insect numbers. Other major food consumed includes fruits and flower nectar as well as vertebrates and blood. Bats rarely fly in the rain, as rain interferes with their echolocation, making them unable to locate their food. Social structures of bats vary on the species, as some live solitary and others living in caves colonizing by the millions. It’s likely for bats to carry many diseases such as rabies, SARS, and henipavirus. If a bat invasion happens to you, let Century Pest Control handle your bat problem.
Bat control measures can differ in methods depending on the area roost prevention is needed and/or the living roost that needs removal. In most cases we prefer installing exiting tools, these are tools that are installed at the main roost entrance which will allow bats to leave but not re enter. Return visits are made to ensure all the bats have vacated the roost prior to sealing. Bats are very sensitive to physical handling and chemical agents and we avoid these techniques. We allow them to exit naturally back into the environment so to minimize any harm to them.

Phylogenetic relationships of these taxa to each other and to extant lineages of bats were investigated in a parsimony analysis of 195 morphological characters, 12 rDNA restriction site characters, and one character based on the number of R-1 tandem repeats in the mtDNA d-loop region. Results indicate that Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx represent a series of consecutive sister-taxa to extant microchiropteran bats. This conclusion stands in contrast to previous suggestions that these fossil forms represent either a primitive grade ancestral to both Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera (e.g., Eochiroptera) or a separate clade within Microchiroptera (e.g., Palaeochiropterygoidea). A new higher-level classification is proposed to better reflect hypothesized relationships among Eocene fossil bats and extant taxa. Critical features of this classification include restriction of Microchiroptera to the smallest clade that includes all extant bats that use sophisticated echolocation (Emballonuridae + Yinochiroptera + Yangochiroptera), and formal recognition of two more inclusive clades that encompass Microchiroptera plus the four fossil genera. Comparisons of results of separate phylogenetic analyses including and subsequently excluding the fossil taxa indicate that inclusion of the fossils changes the results in two ways: (1) altering perceived relationships among extant forms at a few poorly supported nodes; and (2) reducing perceived support for some nodes near the base of the tree. Inclusion of the fossils affects some character polarities (hence slightly changing tree topology), and also changes the levels at which transformations

Daniel Kish has been blind since he was 13 months old, but you wouldn’t be able to tell. He navigates crowded streets on his bike, camps out in the wilderness, swims, dances and does other activities many would think impossible for a blind person. How does he do it? Kish is a human echolocator, a real life Daredevil.
Kish was born with bilateral retinoblastomas, tiny cancers of the retina, which is part of the eye responsible for sensing visual information. Tumors form early in this type of cancer, so aggressive treatment is necessary to ensure they don’t metastasize to the rest of the body.
Unfortunately, the tumors cannot be separated from the retina. Laser treatments are performed to kill them off, followed by chemotherapy. The result is that the retina is destroyed along with the cancer, meaning patients often are left completely blind. Kish lost his first eye at 7 months and the other at 13 months. He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. He stood over it, angled his head upward and clicked over it with his tongue, listening for the echo. He could tell there were things on the other side. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating.

When you’re learning about Evolution in school what you’re usually taught is basically that over time species gain new traits, traits that make individuals more successful become more common. Through this process the species gradually changes. This is usually presented as the species becoming gradually better (smarter, stronger, more successful, you get the idea).
This idea makes sense, it’s easy to understand, but it isn’t really accurate. A common argument made against Evolution in general is that this model doesn’t hold up to scrutiny very well. Creationists like to point to things like species of insects that are known to have gone hundreds of thousands of years without changing significantly, or the Cambrian Explosion, where a huge amount of diversity appeared extremely quickly. Are Creationists right that these things disprove Evolution?
Sort of. These observations do pretty much blow a hole in the image of Evolution that I described earlier, what is normally called the gradualist view of Evolution. However, Evolutionary Scientists have known about these problems for a long time, and have an explanation for them. That explanation is: Punctuated Equilibrium.
The Punctuated part happens when the environment changes. When the environment a species is living in changes, then the selective pressures acting on the species will change. For example, suppose there was a species of beetle that only dealt with predators that hunted by smell or sound. These beetles would develop a variety of colorations since their coloration did not impact their survival. Then, suppose a new predator appeared that hunted

The mitotic phase follows interphase. Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed.
During interphase, the cell undergoes normal processes while also preparing for cell division. For a cell to move from interphase to the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G 1 , S, and G 2 .
The first stage of interphase is called the G 1 phase , or first gap, because little change is visible. However, during the G 1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins, as well as accumulating enough energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration.

Timing of the virus’s effect varied by strain. For one from Puerto Rico, brain cell die-off happened in mice only in the first two trimesters.

Unlike all known proliferative Drosophila adult precursors, papillar cells endocycle before dividing. Furthermore, unlike diploid mitotic divisions, these polyploid papillar divisions are frequently error prone, suggesting papillar structures may accumulate long-term aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate an indispensable requirement for pre-mitotic endocycles during papillar development and also demonstrate that such cycles seed papillar aneuploidy. We find blocking pre-mitotic endocycles disrupts papillar morphogenesis and causes organismal lethality under high-salt dietary stress. We further show that pre-mitotic endocycles differ from post-mitotic endocycles, as we find only the M-phase-capable polyploid cells of the papillae and female germline can retain centrioles. In papillae, this centriole retention contributes to aneuploidy, as centrioles amplify during papillar endocycles, causing multipolar anaphase. Such aneuploidy is well tolerated in papillae, as it does not significantly impair cell viability, organ formation or organ function. Together, our results demonstrate that pre-mitotic endocycles can enable specific organ construction and are a mechanism that promotes highly tolerated aneuploidy.

Applying a rebalance update doesn't affect your total returns. Your total returns before and after rebalance remains the same. Let’s understand it with a very simple example.
Suppose you invested Rs 100 in Stock A. After 3 months the value of your investment increased to Rs 120. This is how your P&L summary will look.
Now you decide to sell Stock A and Buy Stock B. You will get Rs 120 when you sell Stock A. At this point Rs 20 moves from your current returns to realized returns. But the the total return which is the summation of realized and current returns, remains the same. This is how your performance summary will look like once you complete the transaction.
The same would happen when you rebalance your smallcase. You sell few stocks and buy few stocks, but your total returns more or less remains the same.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

Chromalveolates descended from a heterotrophic bikont (a bi-flagellated eukaryote), in which a secondary endosymbiotic event gave rise to a plastid-like organelle . Members of the alveolata are characterized by cortical alveoli (flattened vesicles located between the plasma membrane and a network of subpellicular microtubules), and micropore . They are further divided into phyla including ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans, which differ mainly in their motile machinery [3, 4]. While ciliates and dinoflagellates move by means of cilia or flagella, invasive stage apicomplexans typically move by gliding motility. Additionally, many ciliates and dinoflagellates are free-living, while all apicomplexans are obligate parasites.
The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses numerous important disease-causing pathogens including the agents of malaria, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, Texas and East Coast fever, and coccidiosis. The most widely studied of these are Plasmodium species, agents of malaria  and Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis . Apicomplexans undergo asexual (vegetative) replication in order to cause acute infection (Fig. 1a, b). During asexual replication, Apicomplexa use distinct cell division schemes of fascinating complexity and variability to adapt to different hosts and suit specific intracellular niches . Both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma can also differentiate into gametes and undergo sexual recombination (Fig. 1d, e). In Toxoplasma, this occurs in the intestinal epithelium of cats and the resulting oocyst is shed in cat feces and sporulates in the environment.

How cytoplasmic tubulin is recognized for centriolar/ciliary-microtubule construction remains poorly understood. Centrosomal-P4.1-associated-protein (CPAP) binds tubulin via its PN2-3 domain. Here, we show that a C-terminal loop-helix in PN2-3 targets β-tubulin at the microtubule outer surface, while an N-terminal helical motif caps microtubule’s α-β surface of β-tubulin. Through this, PN2-3 forms a high-affinity complex with GTP-tubulin, crucial for defining numbers and lengths of centriolar/ciliary-microtubules. Surprisingly, two distinct mutations in PN2-3 exhibit opposite effects on centriolar/ciliary-microtubule lengths. CPAPF375A, with strongly reduced tubulin interaction, causes shorter centrioles and cilia exhibiting doublet- instead of triplet-microtubules. CPAPEE343RR that unmasks the β-tubulin polymerization surface displays slightly reduced tubulin-binding affinity inducing over-elongation of newly forming centriolar/ciliary-microtubules by enhanced dynamic release of its bound tubulin. Thus CPAP regulates delivery of its bound-tubulin to define the size of microtubule-based cellular structures using a ‘clutch-like’ mechanism.

Because it exists in a delicate balance with estrogen, it can cause several problems when your hormones go haywire. Many times, women face lower levels of all hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. But what happens when levels of this hormone become too high? Keep reading to find out how to recognize high progesterone levels and how to treat them.
What Causes High Progesterone Levels?
Naturally, women should experience increased levels of progesterone during ovulation and pregnancy. However, when many middle aged women reach menopause, their reproductive years are part of the past. During menopause, high progesterone levels are usually the result of a hormonal imbalance. This occurs when there is a drastic drop in estrogen production, causing progesterone dominance. High progesterone levels can also be the result of sedentary life and an imbalanced diet.
What Are the Symptoms of High Progesterone?
Increased progesterone levels often have signs and symptoms such as muscle fatigue, drowsiness, and mood swings. In addition, this condition can affect your sexual health by causing vaginal dryness and loss of libido. Emotionally, you may be more prone to anxiety and depression.
Other less common symptoms of high progesterone can affect your physical appearance. In excessive amounts, this hormone can cause oily skin, acne, and weight gain. It can also affect your excretory system, causing urinary tract infections and incontinence.

Most remedies for fibroids tend to be very safe to use at any time and are beneficial for good overall health. However, you need to avoid using any which involve herbal treatments unless you have consulted your doctor.
Fibroids can affect a pregnancy although their impact is often minimal. Although the vast majority of women will go on to have a normal pregnancy, it makes sense to do everything possible to ensure a happy outcome.
The location of fibroids can affect your pregnancy. If they are located near the neck of the womb or near to the fallopian tubes they can prevent implantation. Fibroids located just beneath the womb lining can distort the interior of the uterus and this can make implantation difficult or even cause an early miscarriage. Although fibroids may bleed during pregnancy, this is not usually dangerous and will settle without treatment.
One of the best natural remedies for fibroids during pregnancy is to eat a healthy diet which is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables. Try to eat only organic meats and avoid processed meats such as salami and sausages and cut off any visible fat from the meats you do eat.

To avoid overeating during the Easter holidays, up to 40% of the content on the plate should be meat and 60% should be vegetables. To avoid indigestion, one should drink a glass of red dry wine, eat fruit and take a break of several hours between meals. Nutritionist Sergiu Munteanu has told IPN that one should only taste the good during the first Easter meal.
According to the nutritionist, the persons who fasted should return to a normal eating regime gradually. After only tasting the food, the body will be more prepared to digest meats products. To avoid stress after eating plenty of meat, one should drink a glass of red wine and eat fruit, such as pineapple, grapefruit and kiwi, to ease digestion.
Sergiu Munteanu noted the stomach, pancreas, liver and other organs of the digestive system will be affected if one eats too much meat during the feast. “If you returned from church, only taste the blessed dishes.

What do I do if my cat is exposed to lilies?
Take a photo of the lily, and immediately dispose of the lily in a closed outdoor trash can. DO NOT bring the lily with you to the veterinary hospital because you could potentially expose other cats to this toxin at the hospital. Go to the nearest veterinary hospital that allows for 24 hours hospitalization, such as a specialty veterinary hospital like Animal Internal Medicine and Specialty Services. It is standard care to hospitalize your pet for at least 48 hours, if not more, if your pet has ingested the lily. A veterinarian has to monitor blood levels of kidney related values to ensure that kidney failure does not occur. Do not wait for the next day, or two days later when your vet has an open appointment. Lily toxicities are REAL and can lead to death. Like most toxicities, the sooner you get to the vet and start intravenous fluid therapy, the better your cat’s prognosis.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

In order to not return the kilograms after losing weight, you need to completely revise the principles of nutrition and make a diet menu for weight loss for each day. But to find out all the information about nutrition, sometimes just do not have enough free time, so we suggest you learn about its basics and how to create a daily menu for weight loss.
The basic rule of losing weight is to consume fewer calories than to consume. When this happens, the body replenishes calories by reducing body fat. Composing a menu of proper nutrition for weight loss every day with recipes, keep in mind that most of the diet should be taken up by slow carbohydrates that saturate the stomach for a long time, allowing a long period of time not to feel hungry. Weight loss will also occur slowly, but there is a big chance that the pounds will not return, especially if you stick to the right diet all the time.
Eat when you feel like eating. The process of digestion is associated with energy. The feeling of hunger during weight loss occurs when the body’s resources are exhausted – this is how nature has led. If there is no hunger, the food eaten will not go well, but will contribute to fat deposits.

A B.A.R.F. diet is a popular – and responsible – choice for your pet. But there are some factors you need to consider before going this route.
It’s a sound principle. Dogs and cats should be nourished with the food their bodies are designed by nature to thrive on. But species-appropriate nutrition cannot be found in the vast majority of commercially available pet foods – a fact many savvy folks are catching onto.
B.A.R.F. (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food, or Bones And Raw Food) diets are founded on the principle of natural nutrition. This diet usually consists of feeding ground meat with a calcium supplement or edible bones (i.e. chicken wings, backs and necks) that can be fed ground or whole, organ meats, eggs and fish, pureed veggies and a small amount of fruit (to mimic intestinal contents of prey) as well as supplements necessary to balance the diet.
In the wild, dogs and cats consume small prey whole (such as moles, voles and mice), but eat selectively from larger prey, sometimes leaving the stomach and entrails behind. For this reason, I recommend a B.A.R.F. diet over the prey model. When canines and felines consume intestinal contents, they receive a rich dose of their prey’s diet passed up the food chain, including finely chewed grasses and berries. I believe feeding foods that mimic a prey’s intestinal contents provides sources of phytonutrients, antioxidants, enzymes and vitamins not found in muscle meats, and are very beneficial to our companions’ overall health.

Amy Hengstebeck of Kaufman Children's Center in West Bloomfield offers advice.
When people talk about kids who are picky eaters, the conversation usually revolves around how to encourage kids to eat a better variety of foods, not necessarily why the child is a picky eater. And yet the “why” of picky eating can play a major role in helping kids overcome it.
It’s true that some kids are just fussy. They like what they like and they don’t want to eat other foods.
But some other causes of picky eating – the extreme version of the issue – are more complicated than that. For instance, if a child has a decreased awareness in his or her mouth, they can struggle to feel their food and can become overwhelmed and give up on eating.
If a child has decreased coordinated movements of oral structures, the child is not able to smoothly move the chewed food in their mouth and is at an increased risk of choking. Muscle weakness in the mouth can be another factor, which can cause kids to avoid foods, like meats, that require stronger jaw muscles.
In some cases, kids who struggle with certain food textures are found to have tactile defensiveness. This is when a child struggles processing touch and may lead the child to avoid foods like applesauce or yogurt, for instance.

For some luckily it never happens. But now a days its increasingly common. We spend our days planning for the future, worrying about it, or both.

Lent is the annual Christian holiday that precedes Easter. Derived from the Anglo Saxon word "lencten," (which means "spring"), it's a special period of reflection, fasting, and penance practiced by Christians in preparation for Easter.
According to the 1963 Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy put forth by Pope Paul VI, the two main elements of Lent are the recalling of the sacrament of baptism and penance so that the members of the Church can "hear God's words more clearly" and "devote more time to prayer."
The season of Lent lasts 40 days to represent the amount of time Jesus spent in the desert, fasting and preparing for his ministry. Today, Christians may choose to give up luxuries like dessert or alcohol, or perform an act of kindness like volunteering, until the Lenten season is over.
The time period in which Lent takes place is determined by when Easter falls that year (which varies). Here's exactly when Lent will take place this year and why Christians observe Lent in the first place.
First of all, when is Lent?
Each year, when Lent happens is determined by the liturgical observance of Easter Sunday, which is moving Christian holiday. Easter occurs on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon, which is the first full moon on or after the spring equinox, according to BBC.

More often than not, the butcher’s section of your local supermarket will offer discounts on greater quantities of meat, and you might find yourself with excess meat that needs to be preserved.
You may be inclined to toss your pre-packaged meat into the freezer, which is a safe way to ensure you can enjoy most meats for up to three or four months, according to the FDA.
But a major reason you might want to invest in a roll of butcher-approved wax paper is that most grocers choose to wrap their meat cuts in permeable packaging – meaning air can affect the quality of your meat as it sits in your freezer, often causing freezer burn over extended periods of time.
Freezer burn can occur with frozen meats when the dry air inside your freezer causes dehydration and oxidation over time. If your meat happens to get exposed to the harsh cold and shows signs of freezer burn, you’ll still be able to eat it – but it won't taste as good.
Another reason to invest in an additional layer of wrapping for your meats is the unforeseen chance your store wrapping rips or tears. If you happen to tear or even poke a small hole in the minimal packaging of your meats, freezer burn is a safe bet.

While this type of system is often more expensive to run, there are many different factors affecting its running costs. And, unlike their gas-powered cousins, electric systems can accommodate air conditioning installations using their existing blower motors and ductwork. This makes them a clear winner for homes located in areas with excessively hot summer temperatures.
When it comes to cost, an HVAC system's hardware is one of the leading factors in the cost of running it. Different manufacturers, models, and system sizes all utilize different amounts of energy. And some systems that are rated Energy Star compliant use less energy than systems that aren't.
The HVAC system's ductwork located under your house or in the attic space is responsible for moving around all of the heated or cooled air. Since the air can be cooled or warmed by the outdoor temperature, it must be well insulated and all of its connections must be sealed tight with duct tape.
The insulation in your home determines how much heat transfer happens between indoors and the outside. The more winter heat and summer cooling you lose to the outdoors, then the more your HVAC system will need to run to keep your family comfortable.

And what happens is we don’t have a whole lot of winds at the surface, we don’t have any rain to clear anything out, so basically nothing’s being diluted and it just builds up over the course of the multiple days.
In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Schnell reports on research done while at UC Irvine studying 15 years of heat waves and modeling how the heat and pollution spread and persist. The work will help provide early warnings of life-threatening events and predict the longer term effects of climate change. I’m Bob Hirshon for AAAS, the science society.
Heat-related deaths are a cause for concern in many countries, especially among vulnerable populations, like older adults and young children. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were a total of 7,233 heat-related deaths in the U.S. between the years of 1999 and 2009. In that time, an average of 658 people died of heat-related causes in the U.S. each year. Worldwide, nine of the top 10 heat waves with the most fatalities have occurred since 2000, according to data in EM-DAT, an international disaster database. These nine heat waves caused 128,885 deaths around the world.

Energy efficiency rates three factors: solar heat gain, non-solar heat transmission (the "U factor"), and airflow. The non-solar heat loss happens by way of conduction, convection, and radiation through your window. Solar heat gains come from the sun shining into your home. Airflow happens intentionally when you open the window or unintentionally, which is called infiltration or leakage.
A sliding window is one type of sash style. The materials your window is made from and the sash style affect the above three factors. Generally, wood, vinyl, or fiberglass frames are better insulators than aluminum or other metals, so choose sliding windows in these materials. The number of panes of glass, what fills the space between them, and the coating on the glass all affect the energy efficiency so sliding windows with a lower U factor will be more energy efficient.
Horizontal sliding windows usually provide minimal ventilation with an effective open area of 45 percent, which may make cooling a home naturally a bit less effective. Sliding windows can also be leaky, and leakage can be responsible for up to 10 percent of a home's energy usage. The lower the air leakage rating on the label, the better. Keep in mind that leakage ratings on windows don't account for installation, so maximize your sliding

Tensile strength is a measurement of the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks.
Yield strength – The stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation. This is not a sharply defined point. Yield strength is the stress which will cause a permanent deformation of 0.2% of the original dimension.
Ductility is when a solid material stretches under tensile stress.
Welding is like most solutions in life: there are trade-offs. You have to decide what the most important outcome for your situation is. And remember, you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.
Welding’s big trade-off is between strength and ductility. If you have too much of one then you’ll have less of the other.

Rocks that have melted are called metamorphic rocks. Metamorphic rocks are known as magma when they are under Earth's surface, and lava when a volcano expels them.
Heat is the most important factor affecting the melting point of rock. High temperatures cause the ions in the rock to move quickly, which results in a deformation of the rock. Rock melts when subjected to temperatures between 572 degrees Fahrenheit and 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit. Different types of rock, formed by different materials, will melt at different temperatures.
A great deal of pressure is inside Earth, which causes heat. Imagine rubbing your hands together very hard; this pressure causes heat. Something like this happens -- on a much-larger scale -- under Earth's surface, which is why magma exists in Earth’s core.
The higher the water content of the rocks, the lower the melting point, meaning that they require less heat to melt. The water mixes with the rock particles and speeds up the formation of crystals.
Certain types of rock, such as basalts, must be exposed to high temperatures for a very long time before they start to melt. This reaction is also dependent on the water content of the rocks -- basalts have a low water content; therefore, they take longer to melt. Also, the less pressure the rocks are subjected to, the longer it will take for them to melt.

As the summer heats up here in SoFlo, do you find yourself struggling more to remember things? Do tasks that took you a few minutes in January take longer in June? As it turns out, heat may affect cognitive function.
Studies have shown that test scores in schools tend to decrease during the hotter months, and convenience stores sell more “quick pick” lottery tickets than scratch-offs (ostensibly because people have more difficulty choosing between the vast variety of scratch-offs).
In one study, groups of people were put in either cool or hot rooms and asked to choose between two cell phone plans that offered the same benefits: one that looked good on the surface, but was more expensive; and another that was less expensive, but required a little bit thinking to get to that conclusion. More often people in the hot room chose the more expensive plan, while those in the cooler room chose the more reasonable, cost-effective plan.
So, how does heat affect our thinking? Glucose is the precursor molecule of energy production in the body. We need glucose to run all the processes in our body, including temperature regulation and cognition.
One theory is that our bodies need to work harder, and thus burn more glucose, in warmer environments. As the body depletes glucose stores trying to keep cool (sweating), it leaves less available energy for other functions like thinking. This leads to slower thought processes and poorer decision making.

That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable.

Air conditioning works by moving heat around. Basically, an air conditioner takes the heat inside of your home and moves it outside. Remember, coldness doesn’t really exist—it’s merely the absence of heat. Heat transfer happens when a warmer element is placed near a less-warm element. The heat in the warmer element will always transfer to the less-warm element. Keep this in mind as we discuss what happens inside an air conditioner.
The refrigeration cycle in an air conditioner keeps your home cool. There are four main parts in the cycle: the evaporator coil, the compressor, the condenser coil and the expansion valve. Running through these parts is a special liquid called refrigerant. As the refrigerant goes through the cycle, it changes in state (from liquid to vapor and back), temperature and pressure.
The blower in your unit brings indoor air into the cycle. The heat in the indoor air is transferred to the refrigerant inside the evaporator coil, which is colder than your indoor air. The refrigerant then brings the heat to the compressor, where it’s compressed into a very hot vapor.

ONE: We talked about volcanoes before. Those volcanoes have lava vesicles (the tubes that bring lava to the surface). When those vesicles cool, sometimes holes remain. Those holes are like tubes that go directly into the bedrock. Weather, water, and heat/cold can get in those vesicles and affect the bedrock.
TWO: When any type of earthquake happens, sometimes faults develop. Those faults are cracks in the surface and in the bedrock. Wherever there is a way in, the weather will get inside and start eroding the bedrock.
THREE: You already know that the Earth is always moving. When stress on the land happens, small joints can occur. Joints are tiny cracks in the land. They aren't big like a fault. They are small cracks sometimes created by folding on the surface.
FOUR: Solution cavities are something special. There are special rocks out there with a lot of calcium. Limestone is a good example. Those rocks are (compared to others) very soft. When water gets near them, the rocks can dissolve easily. When they dissolve, cavities are created. Those cavities are small holes in the rocks. As time passes, the holes allow more and more water in, and the temperature/weather begins to erode the rock.
FIVE: Last are the super tiny holes, microscopic spaces

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Actually, most adhesion tests carried out are comparative moderately than a real measure.

The usual formula isn't rent/gross income but rent/revenue. Revenue is the money the company makes from selling goods or services.

Depending on the nature of your business, gross income and revenue may be interchangeable, or there might be a huge gap between them.
The rent-to-revenue ratio is also referred to as the occupancy cost.
Calculating the percentage is simple enough: Divide your annual rent by your anticipated revenue. Suppose you're looking at a space that rents for $2,000 a month. That translates into $24,000 per year. If you expect to make $150,000 in the same year, the ratio is .16, or 16 percent.

Which is where two NASA probes have been cruising for more than six years, unlocking secrets of the invisible radiation belts circling above Earth.
“We have learned much more about how these particles get trapped, how they have their motion, how they accelerate, their losses,” Collado-Vega said.
Now the mission enters its final phase. The probes will be brought into lower orbits, and will eventually burn up in the atmosphere.
“We’re pretty much saying goodbye to the mission, but we’re still analyzing data,” Collado-Vega said.
The science collected in this mission is important to technology we often take for granted.
“This area is well within the orbit of many of the satellites we have in space and that kind of radiation can effect instrumentation. And if that happens then you have the loss in communications, GPS signal loss and that would affect the technology we use every day,” Collado-Vega said.

Not all distances to the subjects were noted, however, most specifics were within 1 meter.
Why are these charts interesting?
First, you can use it as a guide for field recording sound effects. We all know that not all recorders and microphones are created equally. Some are designed to shine when paired with certain sound effects, or when doing specific tasks.
First, not every microphone can capture loud sounds at all. Some may top out at certain decibel ratings and are unable to capture louder sounds. This measurement is known as maximum sound pressure level (SPL). For example, Audio-Technica’s BP4029 stereo shotgun condenser microphone can handle a maximum of 126 dB (click the “Specifications” tab at the link above). That means jet engines and rifle blasts are beyond the capabilities of that microphone.
What happens when attempting to record sounds higher than a microphone’s max SPL rating? The microphone’s diaphragm will be flattened. It just isn’t sensitive enough to capture the powerful waveforms from loud sounds. The result? The sound will be distorted.

And what can we do about it? i suppose its a gradual process that starts in childhood to some degrees and is experienced more acutely in adulthood.
For some luckily it never happens. But now a days its increasingly common. We spend our days planning for the future, worrying about it, or both. We see things and react to them based on passed experiences and could become unwilling or just not have the awareness necessary to let things go, to start fresh. I guess its just too easy to get so stuck in a set way of seeing things that it blinds us to the perspective of realizing how everything alive is constantly changing and evolving, including ourselves of course.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision. Thus an object might be described as noisy or evil, or described only in oblique, indirect ways, as a way of indicating that it is large or fast.

Homeowners should not try to make their entire property bat-free, but it is understandable when they want to keep bats out of their home. Many people have a fear of the creatures because they worry about rabies and the spread of other diseases. Homeowners that think they have the animals in their home need to know where to turn for Bat removal in Dublin OH.
A quick glimpse of a shadowy figure is not enough to determine if a home is infested with bats. When a bat infestation is taking place, it is important to go to the location of the suspected nesting area and look around. Bat guano is plentiful and large enough to see easily. It is also often present around the exterior of their entry point into the home. An additional sign is a greasy mark on the siding where the bats squeeze through. Bats produce oil in the sebaceous glands of their muzzle that helps with grooming.
Bat removal in Dublin OH is difficult because the creatures are fast and agile. The entire colony must be removed to prevent their return and bat repellents are not usually effective. The animals can slip into very small openings, and their naturally quiet habits make it challenging to know if the entire colony is gone. A professional removal service understands their habits and has the capability of eliminating the problem.

I believe the exchanges between us is important because it points out the difficulties that can arise when one is describing batting principles from a rotational perspective while the other is responding with linear principles. What may be a good rotational batting principle may appear totally wrong when viewed from the linear perspective.
Rotational concepts for hitting the outside pitch are completely different than the linear principles most of us were taught. We were taught to shift our weight forward and use our arms to extend the hands at the ball. This meant that for pitches middle-in, we basically extended the hands back toward the pitcher. For pitches on the outer portion of the plate, we were told that in order to get good wood on the ball, we should "let the ball get in deeper" before we extended and "hit the inside of the ball." The hand-path would now be going out wider because we are extending the hands not at the pitcher but more toward first base.
With rotational transfer mechanics, generating a wider hand-path for outside pitches is NOT governed by using the arms to extend the hands. The width of the hand-path is governed by how far the shoulders rotate by contact. There is no extension of the lead-arm with rotational transfer mechanics. The lead-arm remains fairly straight from initiation to contact. --- If the swing is initiated correctly, the bat will come to

In total, 14 sites in eight counties have been confirmed with either the disease-causing fungus or white-nose syndrome. Bats at sites in Grant, Crawford, Richland, Door and Dane county have tested positive for white-nose syndrome, while the fungus known to cause the disease has been confirmed at sites in Iowa, Dodge and Lafayette counties.
White-nose syndrome has spread to four additional counties from 2014 to 2015.
The original point of infection in Grant County has experienced an overall population reduction of 70 percent from pre-WNS estimates. At this time, this is the only affected location with a noticeable difference in population resulting from white-nose syndrome.
Although winter hibernation is over, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources will continue to review public reports and respond to wildlife mortality events in order to monitor the health of Wisconsin’s bat population.
White-nose syndrome is a deadly bat disease that, among other things, can cause bats to frequently wake from hibernation – this can deplete energy reserves and lead to starvation and dehydration, or death due to exposure before the end of winter. The syndrome was first detected in Wisconsin in Grant County in March 2014, and does not affect people or other animal groups.

Although there are no hard and fast rules about how often you should update your will, certain life changes, such as a divorce, will trigger a need to do so.
But what happens if you divorce and die before you’ve had a chance to change your will? Does your estranged ex-spouse get the property you previously willed to him or her while you were still in love?
In Texas, the answer is no. The Texas statutes provide that if, after making a will, the testator’s marriage is dissolved, either by divorce, annulment or a declaration that the marriage is void, all the provisions in the will, including all fiduciary appointments, shall be read as if the former spouse predeceased the testator.
So if you previously signed a will that gave all your worldly possessions to your spouse, and named him or her as the executor of your will, but then divorced, those you named as contingent beneficiaries would take under the will, and those you named as alternate fiduciaries (executors or trustees) would be called on to act.
Nevertheless, it is important that you update your will after your divorce to reflect your current wishes. Your will is something that should change as your life does. Otherwise it can become an outdated document that doesn’t accomplish your goals or protect the loved-ones you leave behind.
Suppose you were married over 50 years and decided you want your ex-spouse to still inherit everything? Can you rewrite your will to that effect?

They plan to go ahead with it, despite the fact they know those in the biz aren’t going to be happy to share potentially proprietary information.
But here’s where the web rubber might really meet the digital road: whether a broadcaster’s online activities should count towards their Canadian Content expenditures.

The light then disperses through the top of the stone, bringing out its fiery scintillation. If a diamond is cut to deep or shallow, light will be lost through the side or bottom. This reduces its brilliance and, ultimately, its value.
The cut of a diamond can also affect its visual size. Two diamonds with the same carat weight can appear to be different sizes depending on the shallowness or shape of its cut.
When choosing a diamond, hold it up to the light. See how the light dances around - It should throw out a rainbow of colours and display the diamonds natural brilliance.
Ask your Jeweller to show you all the cuts and shapes.
Carat is often mistakenly used to refer to a diamonds size but its actually a measure of weight. One carat can be divided in to 100 points. A 0.50 carat diamond may also be described as a 50 point or a half carat diamond.
Larger diamonds are found less frequently in nature, so they can command a significantly higher price for instance, a one carat diamond will cost more than two half carat diamonds of equal colour, clarity and cut.

Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.
The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.
Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.
Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.
In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.

Under the right conditions, those many cells will coalesce into a single, larger organism. When the environment is less hospitable, the slime mold acts as a single organism; when the weather turns cooler and the mold enjoys a large food supply, "it" becomes a "they." The slime mold oscillates between being a single creature and a swarm.
This model shows how creatures can aggregate into clusters without the control of a "leader" or "pacemaker" cell. This finding was first described by Evelyn Fox Keller and Lee Segel in a paper in 1970.
Before Keller began her investigations, the conventional belief had been that slime mold swarms formed at the command of "pacemaker" cells that ordered the other cells to begin aggregating. In 1962, Shafer showed how the pacemakers could use cyclic AMP as a signal of sorts to rally the troops; the slime mold generals would release the compounds at the appropriate moments, triggering waves of cyclic AMP that washed through the entire community, as each isolated cell relayed the signal to its neighbors. Slime mold aggregation, in effect, was a giant game of Telephone — but only a few elite cells placed the original call.

The calculi so formed consist of formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), formation of stones within uterus (ureterolithiasis) and formation of bladder stones (cystolithiasis). These stones develop because of decreased volume of urine or increased excretion of stone-forming components like oxalate, urate, phosphate, calcium, xanthine and cystine. The size of stones vary from patients to patients, it can range from tiny staghorn stones to the size of renal pelvis.
In Urolithiasis, urinary stones are primarily classified either by location or chemical composition like uric acid, struvite, calcium-containing and other similar compounds.
Patients suffering from this disorder experience severe pain which happens suddenly. Pain is intermittent and does not improve, even after changes in position. The pain exudes from the back, goes down the flank into the groin.
Men excrete more calcium and less citrate, which increases their risk to this disease.
The most common symptoms are vomiting and nausea. Ureteral or renal colic, blood in urine, infection in urinary tract and abdominal pain are some other symptoms.
After treatment, most of the urinary stones pass within 48 hours while some might not. There are various factors that affect the ability to pass out stones from the urinary system like size of the patient, prior stone passage, pregnancy, prostate enlargement and the size of the stone.
In case urinary stones don’t pass, a urology specialist is required for implementing certain procedures.

There are many factors which affect this decision but the main three are: cost, space and experience. Unfortunately, in this hobby, the less experience you have, the more money and space you require to set up a tank which will be easy enough to maintain.
The general rule when selecting a tank is: Buy as big as you can afford and have the space for.
This is because, for marine aquariums, bigger is most certainly better. A larger tank means greater stability in water chemistry, and any changes that may occur take place over a larger time frame which provides the beginner with much more room for error. A simple example of this is when a heater malfunctions; in a small tank the temperature would change rapidly giving very little time to correct the error. Whereas for a large tank, the change in temperature would be over a much longer period allowing the situation to be rectified before disaster happens.
Another advantage in having the largest possible tank is the number and type of species you can display. If you decide you want a nice nano tank to sit on your desk but really like Tangs then you have a problem. Having a larger tank allows you to keep much more fish in terms of numbers and widens the number of species you can have. A general rule is to keep no more than 1 inch

Your healthcare provider will tell you if this procedure is right for you. Many people with blood clots are treated with medicines called blood thinners.

Stress affects a big part of our population, and stress not only takes away the smile on our faces, but also makes our mouth and teeth look sickly and just feel terrible.
Stress can, directly and indirectly, harm our bodies and the longer you are under stress, the bigger the damage would be and the harder it would be to change to a different mindset or environment that is helpful for your physical and mental health.
Having a good work and life balance as well as proper stress management can go a long way in your journey to a better you, and knowing how stress can affect your dental health can motivate you even further in making sure that you are enjoying life to its fullest.
More than 50% of research about gum diseases found out that stress is one of the major causes of weak gums as well as the source of bad habits that further aggravates the said gum diseases.
For instance, those with anxiety problems are more than likely to have bruxism, or what is commonly known as teeth grinding or jaw clenching. Bruxism can definitely affect the health of gums due to the fact that there will be constant pressure and activity while the patient is still sleeping.
People who are suffering from depression can either have too much or too little nutrient intake. This surplus or lack of nutrients will jeopardize the immune system, as well as making tissues and muscles weaker. Another problem would be how someone manages their stress.

In the summer of 2006, hundreds died as temperatures reached the 120’s as far north as South Dakota. Princeton atmospheric scientist Jordan Schnell says heat waves kill partly because they co-occur with pollution, chiefly ground-level ozone and particulates.
And what happens is we don’t have a whole lot of winds at the surface, we don’t have any rain to clear anything out, so basically nothing’s being diluted and it just builds up over the course of the multiple days.
In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Schnell reports on research done while at UC Irvine studying 15 years of heat waves and modeling how the heat and pollution spread and persist. The work will help provide early warnings of life-threatening events and predict the longer term effects of climate change. I’m Bob Hirshon for AAAS, the science society.
Heat-related deaths are a cause for concern in many countries, especially among vulnerable populations, like older adults and young children. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were a total of 7,233 heat-related deaths in the U.S. between the years of 1999 and 2009. In that time, an average of 658 people died of heat-related causes in the U.S. each year. Worldwide, nine of the top 10 heat waves with the most fatalities have occurred since 2000, according to data in EM-DAT, an international disaster database.

The increase for air source heat pumps is particularly significant, returning over 33% more on tariff payments. Any heat pump systems installed from December 2016 will be paid the RHI at these new, increased tariffs as soon as they are implemented.
Also in the Government’s draft amendment is a proposal to set a limit on the annual heat demand against which the RHI can be claimed. The heat demand limits would be set at 20,000kWh for ASHPs, and 30,000kWh for GSHPs. This will not affect the vast majority of households, with the average annual demand of UK homes being significantly less than 20,000kWh at around 12.000kWh (www.ovoenergy.com). Due to the snap General election in May and the ongoing Brexit negotiations the draft proposals have not yet been implemented, though will likely be after parliament reconvenes after the summer recess.

So if you are still a bit skeptical about whether installing a geothermal heating pump system is worth investing in, here are some advantages that might help you make up your mind!
By installing a geothermal heating pump you can save money. Getting a geothermal heating pump will cost you around $15,000–$20,000, including installation costs, ground loops, heat pump, and controls .
While this is a substantial upfront investment, most countries provide incentives to make it easier for citizens to install such heating pumps.
For example, in Canada there is a $3,500 federal grant, in the U.K. the government has put in place a “Renewable Heat Incentive” scheme which provides payments between £2,500-4,000 to households opting for heat pumps.
In the United States, there is a standard federal tax credit .
Even without those government incentives, you can see a return on your investment quite swiftly. A study conducted by the Air Force Institute of Technology estimated that it takes 7-8 years to recoup costs .
Similarly, the UK’s Energy Saving Trust calculated that a geothermal heating pump, or a ground source heat pump as it is also known, can help you save between £410 and £2,000 each year, depending on which existing heating system you would be replacing .

This is where magnetic nanoparticles come in. These balls of iron oxide, just a few tens of nanometers in diameter, heat up when exposed to a powerful magnetic field. Their purpose is to bring heat directly to the tumors. Materials research, performed in part at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), revealed magnetic behavior that proved counterintuitive to the scientific team—a finding that will affect which particles are chosen for a particular treatment.
Choosing the right kind of particles is important because, depending on their structure, they deliver a different dose of heat to the cancer. Some heat up quickly at first, while others require a stronger magnetic field to get going but ultimately deliver more heat.
Although the magnetic field applied for hyperthermia is 100 to 1,000 times weaker that that typically used for MRI imaging, Dennis explains, it’s an alternating field (the magnetic polarity switches rapidly), which requires a lot more power.
With colleagues at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the University of Manitoba and in industry, the team studied two kinds of iron-oxide nanoparticles, each of which has a different internal structure. In one, iron-oxide crystals are stacked neatly, like bricks in a wall; in the other, the arrangement is more haphazard, like balls in a playpen.

The most extreme idea I can come up with is making basic sensory perception garbled; suppose the speakers can see, but only have perhaps 9 pixels of visual light, yet each pixel has superhuman color sensation (perhaps including sensing polarization of the light). That doesn't do much on its own, but further suppose these beings have a shocking variety of superstitions and misconceptions about visual phenomena. For example, directly facing an object obviously means getting it into the middle pixel, and also happens to position it in the best place for hearing. Thus the middle pixel is the 'singing pixel', but in certain very common circumstances actually hearing the object clearly is undesireable. Objects are tagged as bothersome or evil if they end up 'singing', which often means they are described with different vocabulary or referenced indirectly. However, how large an object is, and how much it moves around, also affect how likely it will end up in the center of the field of vision.

I suggest you first read the Input/Output reference guide for the People object to get a better idea of how it's defined, and what parameter affect the heat generation. You'll want to play close attention to the Sensible Heat Fraction field, which defaults to autocalculate.
You'll learn that the Sensible gain is derived from a polynomial function of Temperature and Metabolic rate, and get a representation of the Sensible Heat Gain as a function of metabolic rate for different temperatures.
Given that $Latent Gain = Metabolic Rate - Sensible Gain$, and that the latent gain is the one that "adds water" like you said, it's easy to see that an increase in temperature will produce more latent gain.

FOUR: Solution cavities are something special. There are special rocks out there with a lot of calcium. Limestone is a good example. Those rocks are (compared to others) very soft. When water gets near them, the rocks can dissolve easily. When they dissolve, cavities are created. Those cavities are small holes in the rocks. As time passes, the holes allow more and more water in, and the temperature/weather begins to erode the rock.
FIVE: Last are the super tiny holes, microscopic spaces

Retrieved Text: Credit Scores are used by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of an individual. The stronger the credit score the greater the opportunity to negotiate more favorable terms and interest rates. Weaker credit scores deter banks from lending, and encourage more stringent terms and interest rates, to protect their own position.
A high credit score based on favorable credit information indicates you are in a strong position to payoff debt, which assists you in negotiating better lending terms with banks and institutions.
A low credit score based on unfavorable credit information can make negotiation with lenders more difficult, but does provide a gauge of your status, and insight into how much you need to improve your score to get better terms.
Credit Scores range from 300-850. Scores below 600 are typically regarded as high risk borrowers, 620 indicates away from high risk, 640 is approaching average, and 650 is about average. Scores near to 700 and beyond are generally considered excellent. Scores fluctuate depending on payment history, the amount owed and available credit, length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit in use.
What Reduces the Credit Score?
Closing credit card accounts with a resultant increase in existing credit card balances can also adversely affect the score. The credit information shown in the report shows how it can affect and undermines your score, and highlights the ways in which you can move forward to generate an improved score.
Improving one's credit score is possible by reducing the amount of credit, decreasing the number of credit cards, having a more balanced source
