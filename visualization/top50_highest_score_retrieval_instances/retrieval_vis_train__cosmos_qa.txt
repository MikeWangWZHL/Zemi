McCargo’s lawyers want to use Thomas Cranmer, a Detroit criminal defense lawyer, as a legal malpractice expert witness to counter the allegations that McCargo crossed ethical boundaries while representing Kilpatrick and working out the $8.4-million settlement in the 2007 police whistle-blower trial.
McCargo, who could lose his law license, is accused of covering up perjury and other misconduct, hiding evidence and lying to investigators about his actions after text messages surfaced showing Kilpatrick and his top aide Christine Beatty lied under oath.

Well, it's finally happened. Kwame Kilpatrick's nine lives have expired.
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who will lose his job because he lied while under oath at a police whistle-blower trial, has just pledged to tell the truth as he prepares to admit his guilt as part of a plea deal he just struck with the Wayne County Prosecutor.
The deal calls for Kilpatrick to plead guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice by committing perjury, agreeing to serve four months in jail, pay up to $1 million in restitution, and serve five years' probation. He also agreed not to run for office during that five-year span.
The mayor will turn over his state pension to the City of Detroit, which paid $8.4 million to settle two whistle-blower lawsuits three former cops filed against the city. The mayor was charged with eight felony counts ranging from conspiracy to perjury to misconduct in office to obstruction of justice after the Free Press revealed that the mayor lied on the witness stand during a police whistle-blower trial and gave misleading testimony about whether he intended to fire a deputy police chief investigating allegations of wrongdoing by members of his inner circle.

During the deposition, lawyer Mike Stefani explained how the secret agreements were reached.
The Free Press sued the city in Wayne County Circuit Court to obtain the confidential agreements, which city lawyers insisted did not exist.
Colombo rejected city arguments that some of the documents are private and exempt from disclosure under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, saying, "Nothing could be further from the truth."

DETROIT — For the last two months, as scandal swirled on and on, residents here knew that their mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, was under criminal investigation. Still, when a county prosecutor announced charges against him on Monday, Detroit was left reeling at the scope and seriousness of them.
Mr. Kilpatrick, 37, was charged with eight felony counts, including perjury, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice and misconduct in office. He turned himself in to the authorities just after 5 p.m., and was released on his own recognizance. He has vowed not to resign.
The prosecutor, Kym L. Worthy, painted a portrait of a mayor who had lied under oath, fired a police official and agreed to pay $8.4 million in taxpayer money to settle lawsuits — all to prevent the public from learning of his personal entanglements, including a romantic relationship with his former chief of staff, Christine Beatty.
The mayor left questions to his lawyer, Dan K. Webb, a prominent former federal prosecutor from Chicago, who made pointed criticism about the charges, the notion that a perjury charge would stem from a civil case, and what he described as “selective prosecution” by Ms. Worthy, the Wayne County prosecutor.

James Thomas, Kilpatrick's lawyer, had argued that Kilpatrick has been denied "fair and just treatment" and that he would suffer in today's proceedings. Thomas asked the panel to overturn a ruling issued by a lower court earlier in the day that stated that the hearing could proceed.

DETROIT -- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was a spender, a schemer and a liar.
And taxpayers paid for it, by the millions.
Over seven years, Kilpatrick's public corruption schemes, lavish lifestyle and ethical missteps cost taxpayers at least $20 million, a tab the financially strapped city was in no position to pick up but did anyway — usually without knowing.
On Thursday, Kilpatrick will be sentenced for 24 corruption convictions. As he heads to federal prison for what could be decades, one important question lingers: How much did his extortion, kickback and bribery rackets contribute to the city's financial crisis and its filing in July for the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history?
"Kilpatrick is not the main culprit of the city's historic bankruptcy, which is the result of larger social and economic forces at work for decade," federal prosecutors said in court documents. "But his corrupt administration exacerbated the crisis."
• There's the $8.4 million settlement the city coughed up in the 2007 police whistle-blower trial.
• Another $9.6 million in illegal profits was pocketed over the years through crooked water and sewer contracts, the government says.

Political consultant Joe DiSano leveled the previously undisclosed allegation during a sworn deposition in a racial-bias suit filed against the city by an African-American former Warren police officer.
DiSano's deposition was filed in federal court Friday in former police officer DeSheila Howlett's continuing attempt to show Fouts failed to provide diversity and anti-discriminatory training and repeatedly used discriminatory and racist language.
During his April deposition, DiSano described a discussion in November 2007 on the night Fouts, a longtime city councilman, won his first election as mayor.

In addition to Kilpatrick, her aide Andrea Bragg received subpoenas to testify before a grand jury in the Eastern District of Michigan. The congresswoman’s son is former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, whose actions as mayor are being investigated by federal prosecutors.
Kilpatrick said she’ll have no further comment.
Though grand jury matters are secret, legal observers said Thursday it is likely the subpoenas relate to an ongoing federal investigation of the congresswoman’s son, and possibly her ex-husband, business consultant Bernard N. Kilpatrick.
There is no legal privilege that makes communications between a mother and son confidential, and the spousal privilege would only apply up to the time Bernard Kilpatrick and Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick were not divorced, said Detroit attorney David Griem, a former federal and state prosecutor.
Griem speculated the subpoenas may be related to recent cash fundraising involving tens of thousands of dollars to cover the former mayor’s restitution payments that Cheeks Kilpatrick was involved in, according to media reports.
“I’m not sure of the propriety of a U.S. congresswoman spearheading such an effort on behalf of a family member, especially when the money is given in cash,” Griem said Thursday.

The court denied Kilpatrick and Bully-Cummings' claim that critical comments made about the Detroit police officers - Zack Weishuhn and Patrick Tomsic - were covered by governmental immunity.
The officers stopped Kilpatrick aide Christine Beatty for speeding in a city-issued Ford Crown Victoria in June 2004.
In comments to the media after Beatty was pulled over - and allegedly asked the officers, "Do you know who the (expletive) I am?" - The chief said the officers "harassed" Beatty.
Kilpatrick said in a radio interview that the officers "set up" Beatty and called the traffic stop "the biggest piece of crap."
Attorney Mike Rataj, who represents the officers, said Wednesday that "these were gratuitous comments ... that slandered my clients.
"Now I'm going to take some discovery to find out what investigation they did before they made their comments, and the answer is they did none."
Both officers are still on the job, he said.

DeLauder was told to lie about his high school friend Ball’s residence if anyone asked, according to the suit, and fired, “under the vague pretext that he was not doing his job,” when he refused to lie.
On Friday, Ball denied the allegations in the suit and said he and the council have expected it.
The suit says that about a year ago, the defendants and their representatives “negligently” ordered DeLauder to commit a felony by returning a firearm to a man who served time for a felony and who had pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.
The plea agreement reached by the convicted felon, “included an erroneous and unlawful provision that all items seized from his home be returned to him,” including two guns, according to the suit.
The mayor noted that it was the courts, not the council, that ordered the property returned.
DeLauder is suing for wrongful discharge, violation of the Whistle Blower Act, obstruction of an officer, abuse of process, being discharged in retaliation for refusing to take part in a cover-up, misrepresentation and fraud, and destruction of property.
DeLauder had an “exemplary” law enforcement career of 30 years, including 19 years as a U.S. special agent, before being hired by Terra Alta, the suit notes. He

On March 30, 2015, the Third District Court of Appeal took up the issue of whether a complaint with the Labor Commissioner is a necessary prerequisite to filing a whistle-blower case in court. In Gallup v. Superior Court (2015) 235 Cal. App. 4th 682, the appellate court decided that it is when the retaliation occurred prior to 2014.
Ms. Gallup alleged that her employer, the Superior Court of Nevada County, retaliated by terminating her after she reported that the Family Court Services Department was not providing services in compliance with the law. The trial court overruled the Superior Court’s request to dismiss the case early in the proceedings (demurrer). The trial court made its decision on grounds Ms. Gallup could take her whistle-blower claim directly to court, relying on a Second District Court of Appeal decision (Lloyd v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 320). The matter eventually went to a jury trial, the conclusion of which was a jury verdict in favor of Ms. Gallup for over $300,000 in damages.
The Superior Court appealed, asserting that the trial court’s demurrer decision was erroneous. The appellate court first looked to a California Supreme Court decision (Campbell v. Regents of University of California (2005) 35 Cal.4th 311) that an employee was required to use her employer’s internal procedure before going to court with her whistle-blower claim.

The garden plan included a large area (about 50 x 25 feet) allocated to zucchini and vine crops including watermelon, canteloupe, pumpkin, cucumber, and squash, planted in rows spaced between 4 and 6 feet. To avoid continual weed warfare until these crops could establish themselves in late summer, I sowed crimson clover after the first tilling in late March. In about a months time it had established a solid cover, reaching about 12 inches high. Those weeds that emerged within the clover were removed by hand.
Vine crops were planted in mid May by tilling rows in the clover, and trimming back the clover with the mower to provide sufficient sunlight. As a legume, crimson clover fixes (deposits) nitrogen from the atmosphere in small nodules on its roots. My hope is this will fertilize the vine crops, which are heavy feeders. Shown is a row of pumpkin plants in mid June. These and the squash have grown well; the zucchini, canteloupe, and watermelon not so well.

If Seminole Pumpkin isn’t a Florida native, it was at least an early settler. These cousins to butternut squash were grown by Seminole indians as far south as the Everglades. Traditionally, the vines were planted at the base of a dead or girdled tree and would twine up the trunk, resulting in the unlikely sight of pumpkins hanging from the branches. Today they are most often grown on the ground, where the vines can root along their length and pull more nutrients from the soil.
The Seminole Pumpkin can be substituted for butternut squash or sweet potatoes in recipes, and its flavor is somewhere in between the two. The shell is very tough, so it’s easiest to roast them as halves or wedges and then cut off the rind. The roasted chunks can be frozen to use in soup or casseroles. They also store for several months when fully ripe.
To grow, first you need a lot of sunny space! The vines are very large, running 30 feet or more. They will outgrow a normal suburban landscape bed and make an assault on the neighbor’s yard. But given elbow room, the vine will reward you with huge yellow blossoms for stuffing, as well as many cantaloupe-sized pumpkins.

Pattypan squash (Cucurbita pepo "Pattypan") does not require pruning to grow, but many gardeners prune pattypan and other summer squashes to control vine growth. Pruning also diverts the energy required for leaf and vine growth, instead concentrating that plant energy on producing tasty, abundant vegetables.

Fat, white caterpillars with brown heads hatch out and tunnel into the stems to feed, causing sudden wilting of all or part of a squash vine. If you cut open the stem of the wilted vine lengthwise, you'll find it filled with sawdustlike frass (droppings) and one or more caterpillars. The borer prefers squashes but will occasionally infest cucumbers and melons as well. In the Deep South there can be two generations per year; in the North, only one.

Remove vines as soon as the growing season is over to interrupt the life cycle of second generation larvae. If borers are historically a problem in your garden, place a shovelful of soil at one or more locations along the vines to encourage more roots to develop.

3 How Long Does It Take Cucumber Plants to Produce Fruit?
Summer and winter squash grow on large broad-leafed plants during the warm summer months. The plants don't tolerate frost and the seeds germinate best when directly sown in the garden when the soil temperature reaches 75 degrees Fahrenheit in early summer. Squash begins fruiting soon after the large yellow flowers blossom on the plants.
Summer squash varieties, including zucchini and yellow squash, flower earlier than the winter squash varieties. Most summer squashes begin blooming within 35 to 45 days of germination. Winter squashes, which include butternut, acorn and spaghetti squash, may take up to 55 days before they set their first blossoms. Poor growth from overcrowding, dry soil or fungal diseases may delay flowering. Cool weather with temperatures below 75 degrees Fahrenheit can also delay flowering.
Squash plants produce male and female blossoms on the same plant, so they are able to self-pollinate. Both flowers bloom in the morning and begin to close as the day progresses. Many squash varieties produce more male blossoms than female, so a lushly blooming plant doesn't always result in a lot of fruit. Female flowers have short, swollen stems beneath the flowers that resemble a miniature squash, while male flowers have long, thin stems. If your plant is flowering but not producing, pick the male flowers and rub their centers against the center of the female flowers to speed pollination.
Fruit begins to form within one day of blooming if the flower becomes pollinated. Summer squash fruits are

Although zucchini plants are usually referred to as vines, the growth habit of modern cultivars is more bushy when compared vegetables like twining vine beans. This can be confusing. The long stems stretch several feet across the ground in a somewhat vinelike fashion, which means they need a lot of space to grow. Zucchini plants do produce small vining tendrils along their stems but these are not adequate to support the weight of mature stems and fruit. You will need to tie the stems to stakes or trellises if you want to grow zucchini vertically to save space.
The long vinelike stems and tendrils will begin to appear on zucchini plants four to six weeks from planting. The plants germinate better if you plant them in the garden, rather than starting seeds indoors and transplanting the seedlings because they're sensitive to transplant shock if not hardened off. Unlike other cucurbits, such as melons, which require a long, warm season of up to 100 days, zucchini don't need a long

A more recent theory by botanist Thomas Andres in 1987 is that descendants of Cucurbita fraterna hybridized with Cucurbita texana, resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with Cucurbita fraterna and Cucurbita texana, respectively, as the ancestral species.
Cucurbita pepo may have appeared in the Old World before moving from Mexico into South America. It is found from sea level to slightly above 2,000 meters (6,600 ft).

Not only is zucchini easy to grow, it is also tasty and nutritious, as well as versatile in a number of recipes. All summer squash, including zucchini, are rich in beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamins C and E and numerous healthful minerals. Zucchini can be eaten fresh, baked into bread, roasted, grilled, added to salads and so much more. So, grow zucchini, eat up and get healthy – we’ll supply the tips you need for successful growing and a bountiful harvest.
Sow zucchini seeds or seedlings about 2 weeks after the last frost date in full sun and well-drained, nutritious garden soil. It is best to plant zucchini in hills, three plants in each, to ensure warm soil and good drainage. Hills should be about 8 inches high and 12 inches in diameter. Set hills at least three feet apart, as these plants are dense and require plenty of room for good air circulation.
Zucchini plants will thrive in regular garden soil. If your soil is poor then you may wish to fertilize or amend the soil with compost. Keep zucchini plants evenly watered throughout the season. Mulch the garden bed with salt hay to keep it free of weeds and to retain soil moisture. If growing zucchini horizontally, mulch will keep the fruit clean by preventing it from coming into contact with the soil.
Zucchini is a vine and may be grown vertically, with assistance, on vegetable netting or a fence, trellis or lattice.

Pumpkins are long-season plants, taking 100 days or longer to produce ripe gourds. Pumpkins will continue to grow as long as they stay on the vine and the vine hasn't been bitten by frost. If you had a late spring and were delayed getting the seeds into the ground, your pumpkins may be immature when autumn arrives. Protect your growing pumpkins from cool weather and possible frost by insulating the gourds and vines from the outside air.
Cover the pumpkin gourds with a double layer of blankets when the temperature threatens to drop below 50 degrees F. This blanket layer will insulate the growing pumpkin, keeping the heat from the day near the gourd instead of allowing it to escape into the surrounding air.
Take a tip from orange growers and wet down the pumpkin vines all night if a frost threatens. Attach a timer to a sprinkler and hose. Set the sprinkler in the garden so that the water from it falls on the pumpkins, vines and leaves. Time the sprinkler so that it goes on and wets the plants all night long throughout the night.

What Causes Pumpkin/Squash Rot on Vines?
There are a number of diseases that can afflict a cucurbit crop.
Black rot – One of the more prevalent diseases resulting in pumpkin or squash rotting on the vine is called gummy stem blight, or black rot, and is caused by the fungus Didymella bryonia. This disease is particularly fond of pumpkins and squash, so if your pumpkin fruits are rotting, this is a likely culprit.
Gummy stem blight can affect all above ground parts of the plant at any growth stage. When affecting the fruit, it is called black rot, although lesions may appear on foliage as well and it may become curled and mottled yellow to reddish brown. This pumpkin and other cucurbit rot disease causes the fruit to appear as brown to black rot of the rind, flesh and interior seed cavity along with the appearance of a heavy white and black fungal growth.
Black rot may be seed born or survive on plant detritus from plants which were previously infected. Splashing water spreads spores, infecting other fruit. This disease thrives between 61-75 F. (61-23 C.) in moist, damp conditions.
Anthracnose – Additional diseases may attack cucurbit fruit and among these is anthracnose. Anthracnose will also affect foliage and is most common on watermelon and muskmelon, although it is seen on squash and pumpkins

“The vetting process was thorough and I am grateful for the results,” McCain said.
McCain’s campaign has admitted that he only met with Palin a handful of times before she was placed on the ticket. Revelations about her membership in the Alaska Independence Party, her husband’s DUI arrest 20 years ago, and her daughter’s pregnancy at 17 have become distractions during the week of the Republican convention.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) to publicly repudiate him in 2008. The exchange comes as part of a new trove of emails released by the the Alaska Secretary of State in response to a public records request first filed by Mother Jones.
The idea that Palin would want to purge the name of CUFI’s founder from CUFI’s own press release struck her staff as an odd request. “I’m not a fan of Hagee, but I don’t know how to propose eliminating him without offering an explanation for the request,” McAllister wrote back. “In presenting this to use, I think mostly they wanted to be sure the reference to you raised no objections.” At that point, Palin decided to take the conversation off list, asking McAllister to call her.
Palin’s reluctance to be associated with Hagee was a marked shift from her positions a few years earlier, and reflected her increasing discomfort with the media spotlight. Palin had expressed her admiration for Hagee previously. In a May 3, 2007, email, Palin had asked her scheduler if she had time to attend a Hagee event at the Juneau Christian Center.

Salon talks to screenwriter Danny Strong about Sarah Palin and why he considers her a modern-day "Pygmalion'"
In recent years, Danny Strong has become the go-to guy for political drama for HBO. He's gotten an Emmy nomination and Writers Guild of America award for his screenplay for the 2008 “Recount,” about the 2000 presidential vote in Florida. And now he's gone back to work with that film’s director, Jay Roach, on the anticipated adaptation of the controversial bestseller “Game Change,” which premieres on HBO Saturday. "Game Change" chronicles Sarah Palin's rise during the 2008 presidential race and features a superlative performance by Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin, along with Ed Harris as John McCain and Woody Harrelson as McCain’s senior strategist Steve Schmidt. It is already getting pushback from Republicans, who are calling it a political-year propaganda film.
Oddly enough, Strong began his entertainment career playing key roles in cult series – Jonathan Levinson on “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”; Paris’ boyfriend on “Gilmore Girls”; the hopeful copywriter hired after Don Draper stole his idea on “Mad Men.” We caught up with him in Atlanta last week.

WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) — Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Thursday that questions about Democratic rival Barack Obama’s association with a former war protester linked to Vietnam-era bombings are part of a broader issue of honesty.
Loud cheers from 4,000 people gathered at a sports complex near Milwaukee greeted McCain’s attacks over Ayers, who helped found the Weather Underground, a Vietnam protest group that bombed government buildings 40 years ago. Obama has pointed out that he was a child at the time and first met Ayers and his wife, ex-radical Bernadine Dohrn, a quarter-century later.
“He’s a terrorist!” a man in the audience screamed without making clear to whom he was referring.
The AP and other news organizations have reported that Obama and Ayers, now a college professor who lives in Obama’s neighborhood, are not close but that they worked together on two nonprofit organizations from the mid-1990s to 2002. In addition, Ayers hosted a small meet-the-candidate event for Obama in 1995 as he first ran for the state Senate.
David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, says that Obama, who was a child living in Indonesia and Hawaii in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was not aware of Ayers’ radical past at the time of that campaign event. Some McCain supporters have expressed skepticism about that.

If you only will be painting your kitchen cabinets that is quite a bit simpler than achieving a hardwood finish. If you desire a emblazoned finish there are a few choices you should make. One is whether to switch your existing cabinet entrances, or to just paint the ones. Most people that perform a cabinet reface or resurfacing project have grown tired of all their cabinets and cabinet exterior doors so it is very common to replace the cabinet doors prior to repainting your cabinets. Now if your going to want a wood surface finish for your cabinet refacing task then it is a bit more included than just repainting cabinets. Popular cabinet refacing involves swapping the old cabinet doors with new ones and adding a thin solid wood veneer to the face frame, and any exposed cabinet ends. With this process the veneer is normally cut to fit on every area of the cabinet. Now you can be saying this is already obtaining complicated but rest assured that is a DIY project.

Summary: Green Gobbler will clear even the toughest of your clogged drains in any type of plumbing systems. This powerful drain cleaner will clean soap buildup, hair, shampoo oil, organic matter, paper, & grease. It’s ultra-thick to move through standing water and its 100% biodegradable product.
So, I’ll go ahead. The label instruction recommends that I pour about a fifth of cleaner in this the container and allow it to sit in there for 15-30 minutes. It’s great for drains in the kitchen, laundry sinks, bathroom, lavatory, garbage disposals. Luckily, it’s also odorless, and not corrosive, and won’t leave any waste.
Needless to say, I’d tried to use boiling water, plungers, the vinegar, and baking soda but they didn’t remove the drain clog.
What’s this Drano Max Gel?
This Drano Max Gel is a powerful enzymatic drain cleaner that will clean most of your tough drain clogs. The cleaner is produced by S. C. Johnson & Son – an American company that stands for quality and ethical manufacturing.
But the Drano Max Gel cleaner was first produced in 1923. So, you can guess that it has undergone numerous iterative improvements in safety and quality. However, the company also has other products such as Drano snake and Drano Aerosol Plunger.
It’s produced to protect your pipes

Retrieved Text: When drains get clogged up, traditionally you have only a few choices: a plunger or drain snake that physically removes the clog, or some kind of caustic, toxic chemical like Drano. Even a plumber will either use a plunger, snake or chemical to clear your drain.
And while there is nothing wrong with using a snake (I use a Zip-It to clear hair from my tub drain all the time), drain-clearing chemicals like Drain-O go right into our waste-water stream where they are NOT filtered out, and eventually end up in our rivers and streams.
The main ingredients in chemical drain cleaners are bleach and sodium hydroxide, or NaOH, a highly corrosive salt. Since NaOH is so corrosive, contact via inhalation, ingestion, skin, and the eyes can cause major irritation, vision problems, vomiting, shock if ingested, and even thermal and/ or chemical burns.
Chronic exposure can cause nose and throat irritation, chest pains, dermatitis, and ulceration of the nasal passages. These effects are very severe and unfortunately much too common, as individuals do not heed the warnings and directions printed on the product’s container.
Too often we reach for the dangerous stuff to get the job done, when there are usually safer and more natural ways to accomplish the same thing. So, to avoid using caustic, toxic chemicals, look no further than your kitchen pantry for everything you need to unclog a drain without causing damage to your health or the environment.

Make your own unclogging mixture out of household supplies. Using vinegar, baking soda, and water is an effective, eco-friendly method of unclogging your pipes. The baking soda and hot water will loosen up any build-up that’s clogging your waste pipe, and the chemical reaction from the vinegar will cause the sludge to move on down the drain.
Start by pouring a pot of boiling water down your drain.
After you do this, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Follow this with a solution of 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup very hot water. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
Pour one more pot of boiling water down the drain to flush away the scum that has been loosened up by the baking soda and vinegar.
Purchase liquid cleaners to unclog your pipes. One of the most common ways to clean out your waste pipes is to purchase liquid drain cleaner at your local convenience store. These chemical solutions are often very effective, but can sometimes cause damage to pipes if they are old or worn down.
Popular liquid drain cleaners include Drano, Liquid Plumr, and Rid-X.
The instructions for these products will be included on the bottle, but you will typically use an entire bottle to unclog stopped up

If you’ve tried multiple times to unclog the drain and it’s still not working, it’s time to turn the job over to a plumber. Exerting too much force can permanently damage a pipe or fixture, turning a simple fix into a costly one.
Sometimes that simple clog is a sign of something more serious, like a main sewer line clog. If you hear your toilets gurgling after washing your clothes, or notice water around the floor drain in your basement, that could be a sign of a serious problem to come. This all ties in with small clogs throughout your home. Calling a plumber may be your best decision, as the problem source can be found and addressed quickly, saving you time and headaches later!

After a while, a clog will form, and you'll need drain cleaning help. Before you reach for a bottle of Drano, consider these important things.
Drano is a combination of chemicals that is harmful to the environment, can cause serious chemical burns, and can also eat through your pipes.
Simply put, Drano is a solution of lye, sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt), and aluminum. This combination of harsh chemicals basically eats away at organic matter that causes clogs. While it can sometimes be effective on minor clogs, is that something you really want to be adding to our water system?
A number of things cause clogs, like fat, grease, hair, or putting anything besides waste, toilet paper, and water down a drain. Drano works to decompose these things, clearing the clog. Voila! You're back in business.
As easily as Drano eats through clogs, it can eat through the pipes. Lye heats up when mixed with aluminum, and this is part of why Drano is effective. Heat can crack porcelain, meaning your pipes or fixtures. If you were to put Drano down the toilet (but don't...don't try this at home at all), it could crack the commode. Not only would you need an entire toilet replacement, you could also end up with thousands of dollars in repiping on your hands.
Say you go ahead with the Drano anyway to save money,

Remove the drain stopper and clear out any hair or debris that has accumulated. This should be done at least once a week! Always remove the stopper before cleaning your sink or bathtub (to prevent soap build-up) and then rinse it before replacing it.
If the stopper itself has soap residue, use white vinegar to clean it—either with a cloth or an old toothbrush.
If you cannot remove the stopper, use a small brush to clean around and inside it as best as you can.
Shower floor strainers can be cleaned by unscrewing them off of the floor and rubbing them with white vinegar.
Unclog the drain by using a straightened coat hanger to reach into the drain and either push the clog through or pull it out.
If you are unsuccessful in removing the clog this way, use a plunger.
Cover the opening of the drain with the head of the plunger.
Plug any other outlets to the drain (such as the overflow opening in a tub) with a rag to create a vacuum.
Fill the sink or tub with enough water to cover the head of the plunger.
Pump the plunger 5-6 times and pull it out quickly. Repeat as many times as necessary.
Flush the drain with very hot water to clear any loosened debris.
If the plunger doesn’t work, use a hand auger (also called a snake).

Flacco is finally healthy after missing the past four games with a right hip injury. The Ravens went 3-1 during his absence under rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, and coach John Harbaugh has decided to stick with the first-round draft pick with Baltimore striving to end a three-year playoff drought.
"Every decision is based on making us the strongest possible team we can be," Harbaugh said Wednesday. "Whether it's quarterback or defensive line, that's the bottom line. That's what it boils down to. That's how we feel about this decision, and we're rolling."
Jackson will start Sunday when the Ravens (7-6) host Tampa Bay (5-8).
The 33-year-old Flacco has been a starter since his rookie season in 2008 and was Super Bowl MVP when the Ravens beat San Francisco to end the 2012 season. He has played in 163 games, all in a starting role. Flacco maintained that role for the first nine games this season, but hasn't played since sustaining a hip injury in a loss to Pittsburgh on Nov. 4.
He finished that game, but has since been working to get healthy. Now that he's there, Flacco will return as a second-stringer.

Sports media members and football analysts love to debate whether or not a particular NFL quarterback has achieved “elite” status. It is almost universally agreed upon that Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees fall under the category of “elite.” Beyond this top tier of NFL quarterbacks, there is always debate about which other quarterbacks deserve to be in the same category as the top four. Before the 2011 season began, Eli Manning stated in an interview that he considered himself to be in the elite category with Brady. His statement was the source of great debate on sports talk radio shows. When he helped the New York Giants defeat the New England Patriots for a second Super Bowl championship in a five-year period, many people started to jump on the Eli bandwagon. Super Bowl victories have a way of elevating quarterbacks from good to great, which is why the debate over Joe Flacco’s elite status has kicked into high gear this week. Quite frankly, the debate over elite quarterbacks serves no real purpose since “elite” is in the eye of the beholder.
Throughout the course of NFL history, there have been quarterbacks who have achieved tremendous success without winning a Super Bowl, and they rarely get mentioned in the conversation of greatest quarterbacks of all time. Aside from Dan Marino – who appeared in one Super Bowl – many other quarterbacks such as Dan Fouts, Warren Moon and Jim Kelly are largely unrecognized for their accomplishments because they

Joe Flacco suffered a small setback just as NFL training camps got going, and the Baltimore Ravens are now scurrying for a quarterback to step in while Flacco recovers.
Flacco injured his back while lifting weights as training camp got started, and varying reports have him either getting back on the field relatively quickly, or out for an extended period of time to fully get back to normal. While he does that, someone has to step in for the rest of training camp, and potentially the preseason.
One quarterback getting some serious interest from the Ravens is free agent Colin Kaepernick, who was unsuccessful in finding work this offseason after his last season with the San Francisco 49ers.
As reports had the Ravens considering Kaepernick, word obviously spread to Flacco’s camp, and the current Ravens quarterback quickly reacted to the possible addition at a presser on Friday.
However, as confident as Flacco is in himself and his abilities, and as good of a fit as Flacco may think it is, he still admitted that he wouldn’t want to see Kaepernick get his next chance in Baltimore.
It’s tough to imagine Flacco losing his job to Kaepernick if the Ravens were to sign him, but we’ve seen crazier scenarios in the past with guys like Tom Brady and Dak Prescott earning their jobs for the exact same reason.

Of course, Flacco doesn't see it that way.
After he suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the 10th game of the 2015 season and missed all of training camp and preseason a year ago with a back injury, many wondered whether the pounding taken in his first 10 NFL seasons had caught up to the 33-year-old former star at Audubon (N.J.) High and the University of Delaware.
As cool a customer as there is, Flacco never flinched, despite all the questions during the offseason about his job status. He said the addition of Jackson didn't change his outlook one iota.
"If I am not already motivated to play this game at a high level, then I am in trouble," he said during training camp. "It is what it is. I haven't made too much about it and will continue to be that way and go about my business like I normally do."
Ravens offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg, who once held a similar position with the Eagles, says Flacco is very secure in his position.

With the NFL season kicking off in a few weeks, teams are starting to have to think about their final roster depth charts and where they will need to add players cut from other teams. However, the Baltimore Ravens have an interesting conundrum. Do they or don't they keep three quarterbacks?
If they were to keep three, which of the two backups would be active, and most importantly which one (or both) is active every week. While Joe Flacco has solidified himself as the starter, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh has an interesting choice to make, go with Robert Griffin III or rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson. Each quarterback has his own unique traits and each provides a different case for being the primary back up to Joe Flacco.
Lamar Jackson is without a doubt the future for the Baltimore Ravens, but as of now, he is trying to stake his claim as to why he should be the primary backup for Joe Flacco. He has shown that he can run, pass, and make quick decisions. And he has also shown improvement in each of his four preseason games.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter was the first to report the trade. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport wrote on Twitter that the Ravens will receive “a mid-round pick” in return.
Flacco, 34, spent a decade as the Ravens’ starting quarterback and led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLVII, earning MVP honors in the process. The Delaware product has thrown for more than 38,000 yards and 212 touchdowns in his NFL career, and he is due to make $18.5 million in 2019.
The move reinforces that Baltimore is ready to move forward with second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson as the full-time starter after he replaced Flacco midway through last season. Jackson started seven games as a rookie in 2018, throwing for 1,201 yards and six touchdowns while helping lead the Ravens to the playoffs.
Ravens coach John Harbaugh had indicated as much last month when speaking about Flacco’s future.

That all depends, however, on how he first gets introduced to the league, and if the Baltimore Ravens, who traded up to select him, are willing to alter their entire offense to compliment his unique skill set.
It would be pointless to bombard you with Lamar Jackson’s college stats and speculate whether they will translate to the NFL. Robert Griffin III lit the league on fire in 2012, rushing for over 800 yards (before destroying his knee). Michael Vick, considered by many to be one of the most dynamic quarterbacks, if not players of all time, is remembered for his rushing ability. Vince Young ran for over 3,000 yards during his three years in college and went on to have a successful NFL career.
You may recall that Jackson completed only 57% of his passes in college and was asked to work out as a receiver. You may also remember how he nearly won the Heisman in consecutive seasons because his play is just that impressive and how he managed to run for more yards last season than all but four running backs in the NCAA, doing so while finishing 15th in passing yards. The only question is whether or not the Ravens will allow Jackson to utilize his legs to open up a new dimension in the Baltimore offense.

It’s a question that has been asked of quarterbacks before Flacco. It’s become ritual for sports talk shows to debate if a quarterback has reached the vaunted elite status immediately after winning a Super Bowl, as if that’s the only way a quarterback could hope to win one.
The Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots in the 2018 Super Bowl last Sunday stands as proof this isn’t the case.
The Eagles won because of Nick Foles’ stellar playing. The 29-year-old journeyman quarterback took over the starting job from NFL MVP candidate Carson Wentz in December after Wentz went down with a torn ACL.
Foles was great for the Eagles, winning the Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 373 yards and scoring four total touchdowns in the game. This doesn’t make Foles elite — he just had a great playoff run.

African Americans have been a part of the American Football evolution as far back as the 1920s with players like Fitz Pollard and Bobby Marshall leading the way.

The Los Angeles Chargers, who shut down the Ravens’ ground game in Week 16 and knocked them out of the playoffs yesterday, knew this too.
At halftime of the Ravens’ 23-17 loss, the score was 12-0. It shouldn’t have been that close, as the Chargers settled for a 21-yard chip shot on their first drive. The first-half shut out, at home, no less, was reflected in various other offensive stats beyond the scoreboard. The Ravens’ first-half possessions went as follows: 21 yards and punt, -14 yards and fumble, 13 yards and punt, 8 yards and punt, 21 yards and interception, and 6 yards and punt. Jackson barely sniffed the 50-yard line (let alone the red zone) the entire half. In addition to his two turnovers, he fumbled another time on the play before Kenneth Dixon’s turnover.
Should I go on? Okay, I will.
Jackson finished the half with two completions on eight attempts, for a whopping 17 yards. That’s a 0.00 passer rating, in case anybody is wondering. He amassed 31 yards on the ground, but that hardly made up for the anemic passing attack to that point.

And on top of that stool following a recent practice session here in suburban Baltimore was a purple-covered offensive playbook that appeared to be at least six inches thick.
Summer may be near and Beck may not be the starting quarterback for the Ravens. But that playbook, with his uniform No. 12 on the front, is a constant reminder of what it takes to be a trusty backup in the National Football League at the most important position.

"You have to stay on your toes. You have to be ready," said Demetrius Williams (Oregon), a wide receiver for the Ravens. "You have to be a team player. John is a good guy. He is going to study hard and be ready. It is all about the team."
The Ravens begin training camp July 27 at McDaniel College in Maryland. And when they do, Beck � drafted by the Dolphins out of BYU in the second round in 2007 � will be given a decent shot to be the backup to Baltimore starter Joe Flacco.

The Baltimore Ravens decided to bring in former Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III for training camp to see if he had anything to contribute. It wasn’t expected to amount to much, seeing as how Griffin was out of the NFL last season, and the Ravens already have two quarterbacks: current starter Joe Flacco and rookie heir apparent Lamar Jackson.
But Griffin, grateful for having been given an opportunity to compete for an NFL roster spot once again, has given the Ravens something interesting to think about: after an impressive showing in training camp and preseason, is he worth keeping on the roster and carrying three quarterbacks?
Griffin has gone 12-for-18 for 146 yards with two touchdowns in the preseason so far. In addition to that, he’s looked much more like the confident RGIII of old – the one that won a Heisman Trophy, the one that was drafted No. 2 overall in 2012 by the Washington Redskins and was expected to be the next great NFL quarterback before injuries and ineffectiveness derailed his career.
Given how Griffin has performed thus far in the preseason, it might be worth keeping him on this roster for the 2018 season. If Flacco were to get injured, Griffin would be a decent go-to option to stay competitive, and it would keep the Ravens from having to rush the young and inexperienced Jackson into action.

DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- On a historic night in U.S. politics, Barack Obama secured the Democratic Party's nomination for president and emerged for the first time on stage in Denver with running mate Sen. Joe Biden.
Barack Obama, right, and Joe Biden electrified the Democratic faithful in Denver.
Obama on Wednesday officially became the first African American to lead a major party ticket.
Delegates cried and cheered as former rival Sen. Hillary Clinton motioned to cut the roll call vote short, saying "Let's declare together with one voice right here, right now, that Barack Obama is our candidate and he will be our president."
In speeches before the Democratic faithful, Biden and former U.S. President Bill Clinton repeatedly attacked the foreign and domestic policies of Republican George W. Bush. Both criticized the policies of presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain as maintaining Bush policies.
"John McCain is my friend. We've traveled the world together. It's a friendship that goes beyond politics, and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by John still amazes me," Biden said.
"But I profoundly, I profoundly disagree with the direction John wants to take this country from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Amtrak to veterans."
Citing the emergence of Russia, China, and India as great powers, the spread of lethal weapons and the challenges of climate change and fundamentalism, Biden blamed the Bush administration for what he called "the consequences of this neglect."

Early voting accounted for 22 percent of the votes cast in the 2004 presidential election, and 16 percent of the votes cast in the 2000 presidential election. Given the unprecedented enthusiasm in early voting this year, the Associated Press predicted that it could account for a third of the votes.

Each candidate claims that the other's plan does little or nothing for these taxpayers. In this case, actually, both candidates are right.
Bush targets only 11 percent of his tax cuts to the three-fifths of all taxpayers from the bottom to the mid-dle of the income scale; McCain offers these 76 million taxpayers a mere 5.5 percent of his tax reductions.
As it turns out, both Bush and McCain give almost three-quarters of their tax cuts to the best-off fifth of the population. But within that fifth, there is a major distinction. Bush compassionately targets 37 percent of his total tax cuts to the top 1 percent, those making more than $319,000 a year. The hard-hearted McCain gives only 2 percent of his tax cuts to this elite group.
So Republican primary voters have a tough decision to make: Do they want (a) a tax-cut plan that mainly favors the better off or (b) one that tilts toward the very best off? Decisions, decisions.
Actually, the biggest difference between the Bush and McCain tax-cut plans is size.

Florida is one of several battleground states in which local races may influence the outcome of national contests.
In the 2004 presidential election, Republican nominee George W. Bush won this swing state, which held the largest number of electoral votes and was at the time governed by his brother, Jeb Bush. South Florida, home to large Hispanic and Jewish populations, voted largely in favor of Democratic candidate John Kerry. This year Governor Charlie Crist helped Senator McCain easily win the Florida Republican Primary in January. Senator Obama lost to Hillary Clinton in the state’s Democratic primaries and did not campaign in the state for nine months, his first commercial advertisement not airing until late June.
Governor Charlie Crist, moderate Republican, was accused of going overboard in his attempts to be McCain’s running mate when he supported McCain’s decision to allow states to use offshore drilling to reduce gas prices. Even Crist’s former opponent for governor, stark conservative Jeb Bush, opposes drilling, which would put the state at risk for disastrous oil spills right off its coast.

For example, in 2000 McCain drew a distinction between himself and Bush, arguing that while Bush wanted to fund vouchers by stripping money from public schools, he

In a telephone interview, Schwarzenegger said polls showing the Republican presidential nominee behind nationally and in battleground states do not take into consideration McCain's propensity for come-from-behind victories.
"I have seen him in those major struggles in the past when he has come back when everyone counted him out," Schwarzenegger said. "During the primaries, he came back and got nominated."
As he did for President Bush in 2004, and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, in 1988 and 1992, Schwarzenegger will headline a Columbus rally for McCain on the Friday night before the election. The event will be from 5 to 7 p.m. at Nationwide Arena.
It will be trick-or-treat night in much of central Ohio and organizers are trying to entice people to the McCain rally with events for kids -- face-painting, pumpkin carving and a costume contest. Country and western singer Hank Williams Jr. also will perform.

John McCain abandoned some old positions and soundly defeated former Rep. J.D. Hayworth in the Republican primary. McCain is now favored to win a 5th term in November.
It wasn't pretty, and it wasn't without cost. But Sen. John McCain, seeking a fifth term, trounced former Rep. J.D. Hayworth in the Republican primary in Arizona.
With about 93 percent of the vote counted, McCain had more than 56 percent of the vote, compared to slightly less than 32 percent for Hayworth and 11.7 percent for a third candidate, Jim Deakin.
McCain had never faced a serious challenge for his Senate seat in Arizona, either in the primary or the general election. But facing longtime resentment from the right, especially over his championing of illegal immigrants reach citizenship status and breaking with George W. Bush policies on taxes and torture -- not to mention the rise of the Tea Party and an anti-establishment electorate -- McCain was once considered vulnerable.
But he never ignored the threat. Spending $20 million on the primary, McCain went after Hayworth, whose congressional career came to an end in 2006 following his association with lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who later went to prison. And he switched positions on immigration, talking more about building a fence on the Mexican border than about building a relationship between the GOP and the Latino community. Whatever, it worked, and McCain is all but assured of returning to Washington in January.

The presidential election has an oddly placid feel to it. Four years ago, the notion that George W. Bush would get another four years in office, actually ratified by a plurality of the voters, was more than any liberal could bear, and, after the election, there was loose talk everywhere about "Jesusland" and wanting to flee to Canada. This time, even though Democrats are extremely enthusiastic about Barack Obama, that life-and-death quality is absent. I think the reason is that a lot of liberals kind of like John McCain. I know I do.
Eight years ago, I was a hard-core liberal McCainiac. Here was a Republican saying things no other Republican would say and fighting, Teddy Roosevelt-style, to wrest his party from the hands of the plutocrats who controlled it. And, in the years immediately following that run, McCain established himself as perhaps the country's foremost progressive champion. He was an opponent, on moral and fiscal grounds, of tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the rich. He was also a fierce opponent of the extreme elements of the religious right. He was a proponent of global-warming legislation, the Law of the Sea Treaty, a moderate immigration bill, expanded public financing of elections, a tobacco tax, and many other liberal reforms.
Today, he is none of these things. McCain is almost never asked about his scandalous past. On those rare occasions when he is, he either dissembles (claiming to have opposed tax cuts on the grounds that there were no concurrent spending cuts) or

It’s a damning indication of how poorly things have gone for the United States during its five-year misadventure in Iraq that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can drive in broad daylight though this war-ravaged city and spend the night at the presidential palace, but George W. Bush can’t.
Mr. Ahmadinejad was greeted with lavish ceremony yesterday as he became the first Iranian President to visit Baghdad, a trip some said reflected Iran’s great and growing power in Iraq and how severely the U.S. effort to remake Iraq into a Western-friendly democracy has gone awry.
Supporters of the Iraq War often state that the war has “proven” that we are willing to attack if necessary, and thus was a successful bit of foreign policy.

Former US president George W Bush is among high-profile Republicans who refused to vote for Donald Trump in the presidential election.
Although he denied accusations made by Rush Limbaugh that he had cast his early-voting ballot for Hillary Clinton, Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump, a Bush spokesperson told The Hill.
Indeed, after Jeb Bush left the presidential race, none of the high-profile members of the Bush family have commented on the election – with neither George W Bush nor his father attending the Republican National Convention this year.
But Trump seemed unconcerned by the fact he had not won the former president's vote, telling CNN: "When I see George Bush do that and, look, I was very critical of him for getting us into Iraq, which was obviously a horrible decision, and getting out the way Obama got us out was a horrible way to get out, too, the combination, I don't think it has any impact, frankly.

View Full Version : Does she need me again as a lover ?
my ex gf dumped me 2 months ago because in 3 years I never proposed her. She never told it but I know this is the main reason. She also told me that I never gave her a better life though I did my best. I agree with her on many points, I know my mistakes.
Just before she dumped me, she tried to look for another boy with Line. I knew she was doing it in my back, it was obvious, she didn't let me see her phone and she would turn off the sound so I wouldn't know that someone is calling her.
Right after she dumped me, she went with another boy. Then she would not answer my calls nor respond to my SMS. I sent her some very nasty SMS. I was really desperate and very angry. There were very tough words. I know that I would never had to send these garbage, but I cannot come back on what I did.
After her new relationship finished, she was OK to talk with me. But she was very rude with me. Showing that her new BF was so much better than me, that she had been so much far with him ... hmmm just 1 month.

Since going public with the story, supporters of Kavanaugh have attacked her on social media relentlessly–including President Donald Trump. Trump said that if the attack “were as bad as Dr. Ford has said it was,” she would have filed a report with law enforcement.

Never heard of JYJ? Well, obviously you haven’t been to Korea lately, where the group’s singers, Kim Jaejoong, Park Yoochun, and Kim Junsu, are bigger than Justin Timberlake. Their popularity in their homeland landed them in Guinness in 2008 and 2009 for having the world’s largest official fanclub (more than 800,000 members in Seoul alone) and for being the most photographed celebrities on the planet (they’ve been snapped professionally approximately 500 million times).
And now JYJ are going global, as they release their first English-language album, The Beginning, on Atlantic Records. The disc features production on two tracks, “Empty” and “Be My Girl,” by superstar studio guru Rodney Jerkins (Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Mary J. Blige), and the album’s lead single, “Ayyy Girl,” actually boasts vocals and production by a little American artist named Kanye West.
While the members of JYJ started performing together in 2003 in the Korean boy band TVXQ (who released four successful albums in Korea and four in Japan), the new album title The Beginning is apt here, since JYJ is a rebirth for them–and not just because they’re finally launching their careers in America.

When he and his two TVXQ bandmates Park Yoochun and Kim Junsu left the group over a contract dispute with their record label SM Entertainment in 2010, it seemed unlikely any of them would ever again experience the kind of popularity they had tasted with their former band.
Yet, above all odds, the three singers formed the trio JYJ later that same year and rose above numerous professional roadblocks to become one of the most popular and critically respected acts in K-pop today.
Jaejoong is once again taking risks on his new album "WWW," released on October 29, which sees the soft-spoken artist venturing into hard rock territory to great effect on tracks like the blistering "Butterfly."
A year since KpopStarz last spoke with Jaejoong, the 27-year-old pop star sat down with our video team during a recent solo tour of Japan to discuss the making of "WWW" and where he would like to go next in his music career.
KpopStarz: How would you describe your new album "WWW?"
Jaejoong: This album expresses the main points of a love that is just starting out, the 'who, when and why' of love. That is how I came up with the title of the album. The album features mostly rock styled music and for those that are not fans of rock, it is still pleasing to listen to. There are also many [more mellow] songs on the album and I hope everyone enjoys it.

The road that Jaejoong and his JYJ bandmates Micky Yoochun and Junsu have chose definitely become much more complicated and ‘long’ when they chose to challenge their contract with the all powerful SM Entertainment. It has been a struggle for them to continue with their careers in Korea, Japan, and abroad- every step forward at times seems to lead to two steps backwards.

In whatever angle of every press release they have all made, the conclusion is very obvious — there is still no one in both camps willing to set the trouble behind. SM Entertainment are still pointing some misjudgements on the three alleged members, and TVXQ Three aka Jaejoong, Yoochun and Junsu are mum to their word to not agree on anything unless true legal considerations are presented.
It gives me, a fan, to a conclusion that no matter the legality, professional standards and bonding one spends on their entertainment company (vice versa on their artists) — when actions are made, especially legal ones, it’s a long duration for one to stand by it. I’m proud of the three who continues to fight for what they think is wrong, but that only prolongs everyone’s agony don’t you think?

His charisma is through that unique manly beauty. Lee Dong Wook is different from those directors who simply wore suits. His suits are his basic wears and he do wear the thin knitted top to enhance his maturity. This kind of knitted top is suitable for the recent rainy weather and was worn with a similar coloured innerwear, emphasizing its softness.
He discard the boring black suits and loves to wear blazers of white, blue, light colours etc. His appearance is also not the stance a boss would appear. He would appear in a light and relaxing atmosphere. The white pants and the comfortable sneakers are the main points of his fashion style. With the inner wearing of a black or brown shirt, it completes the director’s loud fashion.

Their name roughly translates to "Rising Gods of the East". Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2003, TVXQ began as a five-member boy band composed of members U-Know Yunho, Max Changmin, Hero Jaejoong, Micky Yoochun, and Xiah Junsu. They were immediately launched to mainstream recognition following the release of their first physical single "Hug" (2004), which peaked at number four on the MIAK monthly music chart. Their first studio albums Tri-Angle (2004) and Rising Sun (2005) were both top sellers, pushing the band's popularity beyond Korea. Under Avex, TVXQ entered the Japanese market with their first Japanese album Heart, Mind and Soul (2006), but it was met with limited success.

This has happened over and over again; and I believe that the fans had relaxed into thinking that the major hurdles were over for JYJ. In reality they have just begun.
Before there was the problem with censorship, denial of contracts, and etcetera, while under the protection of the court system. Now, without the courts, those who have a problem with JYJ and their management are going to feel free to do unlawful things with no thought of repercussion. The problem is that there is no such thing as without repercussion from a fanbase as large as JYJ’s. and individually as large as Jaejoong’s, Yoochun’s, and Junsu’s.
Even if there were a totally justifiable reason for Loen’s actions, it is morally wrong to cancel such important promotional aspects of the contract so close to the release date that it impeeds the marketing, sales, and promotion of Junsu’s album.
There have been so many reasons put out there over time as to why JYJ couldn’t be given opportunities to engage with the mass public. It in now at a point where it all points to harassment.

She also has the edge in major championships, 8-7, and only she can add to that total this weekend.
“It”s really just unfortunate it had to be in the quarters,” Serena said.
In the semifinals, the fourth-seeded Serena will meet No. 6 Dinara Safina, who advanced earlier in the day by overpowering No. 16 Flavia Pennetta 6-2, 6-3. No. 2 Jelena Jankovic will face No. 5 Elena Dementieva in Friday”s other semifinal.

These back-to-back wins put Serena two steps closer to winning her third consecutive major tournament this year. Against Venus, Serena took the match in two straight sets (6-4 and 6-3). This brought her all-time record to 15-11 against her older sister.
“I thought, I’m 33 and she’s 35. I don’t know how many more moments like this youŕe going to have,” said Williams after another chapter in the siblings’ storied rivalry.
Serena has been one of the most dominant players in women’s tennis. She is currently ranked the WTA number one player in the world, has won 20 grand slam tournaments, and has only lost one match so far in 2015.
A win at Wimbledon this year would make Serena Williams the first person to win three major tournaments in a row since she won four in a row in 2002-2003. It would also leave her one major way from being the first player since 1988 (Steffi Graf) to win all four majors in calendar year.
Williams is now scheduled to play another long time rival, Maria Sharapova, who’s ranked fourth in the world, on Thursday. Their last meeting was in the Australian Open Finals in January, where Serena won the title. Williams is 17-2 all-time against Sharapova.

It is a very passionate love sonnet although it doesn’t take the traditional form of a conventional sonnet; it is more of a monologue. In fact there is only one rhyme, in the last couplet. “Sonnet 130” is a poem written by William Shakespeare himself, this is an immediate connection to Anne Hathaway but there is a clear difference in the style and content of the two poems. Duffy’s approach is far more a romantically powerful and passionate, where as Shakespeare takes a rather unstereotypical approach to his feelings for his wife.
In the first line of “Anne Hathaway” there is a clear passion and an instant reference to five of Shakespeare’s plays: A Midsummer Nights Dream, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet and The Tempest. The general feel of the first stanza is that of an enormous bond and earthly involvement in his love for Anne. Carol Ann Duffy mentions dramatic events such as “shooting stars fell to earth as kisses”. This is how many people would imagine a love poem written by Shakespeare to be, using strong, passionate words. The fact that kisses were mentioned brings an instant romantic theme into the poem. This approach of trying to recreate Shakespeare’s style is apparent throughout the poem. The way the words are emphasised suggests that there is a strong romance, an example of this is “…shooting stars…kisses…” all

"People, like Beckham, in their public lives are stories the rest of us follow.
"It's fascinating that the injury takes its name from Achilles... The whole point of Greek myths is the combination of triumph and tragedy that we follow in them," she added.
According to ancient Greek mythology, Achilles was the greatest warrior in the Trojan war.
The myth held that he was made invulnerable by being dipped in the waters of the River Styx.
But, because he was held by the ankle, his heel remained unprotected and became his only weakness.
This is where the notion of "having an Achilles heel" comes from.

Plath is my all-time favourite poet – see my post The Book That Made Me for more on this. This poem, one of the Juvenilia published in her Collected Poems, was written in her early twenties. When I read it for the first time, it dazzled me with it’s technical skill and imagination.
She hears the caustic ticking of the clock.
Plath’s relish for the interplay of language, meaning and sound is unparalleled. She interweaves internal rhymes, assonances and alliterations in this poem so that the first ten lines are a firework display, mimicking the fairytale ball. She uses the sonnet form deliberately, both for its overtones of love but also for the inevitability of its structure. No matter how much fun you have in the first three quatrains, that crushing final couplet is coming. And what a couplet it is, staggering out of the stuttering line 12, with the panicky ticking of the clock echoing through the language.
It’s hard not to get caught up in Plath’s own life story when reading her poetry, but the dazzling flair of the beginning of the poem which can’t escape an inevitable doom seemed too pat a metaphor even for me. The appropriation of a well-known story for a personal twist, however, is something that I’ve enjoyed in

One of the first things I found out was that during her first year in the position Duffy wrote a poem for David Beckham called “Achilles” after he injured his Achilles tendon and was unable to play in the 2010 FIFA world cup. I quickly became confused as to why such a prestigious sounding role was responsible for writing original verse about soccer stars and decided to delve a little deeper.
According to the official website of the British Monarchy, the role of Poet Laureate is an honor given to someone whose poetry is of national significance. When the post was first created the intention was for the Poet Laureate to write original verse for special occasions such as royal birthdays, anniversaries and events. Now however, the position has taken on a more honorary nature and there is no obligation for the poet to produce work for such occasions. In its current form the Poet Laureate holds their position for ten years with a stipend of 5,750 pounds and may choose if and when to write.
The Poet Laureate is chosen by the Monarch following advice from the Prime Minister. In Duffy’s case Prime Minister Tony Blair recommended her along with a list of other candidates to Queen Elizabeth II who made the final decision. It took ten years on the short list for Duffy to finally be appointed to the role. She was originally passed over

Turns out, Kung Fu Panda was funny from start to finish with good animation, great voice acting, and the requisite spiritual/moral/life lessons that can apply to children and adults alike.
Kung Fu Panda tells the story of Po (Jack Black), a young panda trapped in his father’s noodle restaurant. Though his father has high hopes for his son’s food service future, Po has aspirations to be a great Kung Fu master. Po knows all the legends by heart and can imitate some of the moves…those that work well with his overweight, bulky frame that is.

i dont know whats about giving white colour theme for the Villian of the movie. In both these movies, like Tai Lung and Lord Chen, are both of white colour, and Chen surely overtakes in performance (sometimes i forget that i'm seeing/writing-about an animation movie).
So, overall, a very worthy movie to watch it in 3D. And believe me, you wont feel that extra specs in your face as burden while watching the movie.
Well! I agree that it is one awesome movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly. But, in my view, I feel 'Kung Fu Panda 1' is the BEST.
And I didn't not like the 3D effects, I felt it wud hav been better had I watched in 2d. Am not sure if this movie was planned for 3D release from the scratch. Looks like it is added later!
On the whole, it's must watch movie.

The 19-date excursion kicks off June 18th in Pittsburgh and extends into August visiting markets like Charleston, Morrison (with Mavis Staples), Spokane, Vancouver and Anchorage. The new outing follows up 2016's Day Breaks World Tour which stretched into 2017 and was joined by Valerie June on select dates.
Jones released her sixth studio album 'Day Breaks' on October 7th, 2016 via Blue Note Records. Her previous 2012 album 'Little Broken Hearts' peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold in Belgium, Canada and France. The following year, she also released a collaborative album with Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, titled 'Foreverly'. The nine-time Grammy winner has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide and was named as the top jazz artist of the 2000-2009 decade by Billboard.
Norah Jones came on the Jazz / Blues scene with the release of the album 'Live In 2007' released on April 25, 3200. The track 'The Long Way Home' quickly became a success and made Norah Jones one of the most popular artists at that moment. Thereafter, Norah Jones published the hugely beloved album 'Come Away with Me' which includes some of the most well-known tracks from the Norah Jones collection. 'Come Away with Me' includes the song 'Don't Know Why' which has been the most recognized for music lovers to experience during the shows.

Angel-voiced enchantress Norah Jones, today proclaimed as the best jazz lady of her generation, started her career taking the world by surprise. Come Away With Me was certified a diamond album in 2002, selling over 20 million copies and earned Jones five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist. The album remained on the Billboard charts for over a year and it was ranked 54th on the list of the 100 Best Albums of the decade by Rolling Stone – a feat that is even more stunning considering the lack of pop star hype surrounding her name and the fact that only one song on the album, beautiful “Don’t know why”, has received major airplay. Even though some attributed her success to a post-9/11 desire for soothing music, that seems to be stretching too far a very clear fact: no one else sounds like her.
Three more successful albums followed: Feels Like Home was released in 2004, Not Too Late, in 2007, the same year she made her film debut in My Blueberry Nights starring alongside Jude Law, and more recently, in 2009 came The Fall. All gained Platinum status after selling over a million copies in the US alone. Billboard magazine named her the top Jazz artist of the 2000-2009 decade.

We all know how important friends are. There are friends we go for coffee with, friends we shop with and friends we head to the gym with. But despite having a pal for every occasion, having a best friend is a huge bonus in life. Marilyn Barnicke Belleghem, a registered marriage and family therapist, offers some insight into what makes the bond between best friends so special -- and so important.
A best friend is someone you don't have to fill in the blanks with. They already know all the inner details of your life. "It's like picking up a book and knowing exactly where you left off," Belleghem says. You can cut to the chase and get right to the meat of any discussion because all the background information has already been stored away.
One of our most basic fears is being alone, Belleghem explains. Whether your best friend is around the corner or in another time zone, just knowing she is there provides comfort. "It gives you a sense of being connected and not just free-floating in space," she says. So if you find yourself feeling isolated, whether physically or emotionally, pick up the phone and call your closest pal. Both of you will feel better for it.
You have yet to shower or even brush your hair and your best friend calls. She's upset and wants you to come over right away. What do you do? You get in the car without even changing

In the meantime, I am intrigued by the new Apple "Music Store" featuring $.99 song downloads and legally permissible copying/burning to computers, iPods, and CDs. I'm curious how long the $.99 price will actually last. I understand that artists think of their songs as babies and they don't want to pick favorites, but songs are not created equal. The economist in me sees that some songs are worth more than others, and people will pay accordingly. If REM ever releases another good song people might be willing to pay more than $.99 for it. Maybe as much as $2.99 or something. But, if the song stinks, you might be willing to buy it, but not even at $.99.
I suspect the $.99 price is an intro deal to encourage people to buy their music instead of "stealing" it. If companies initially priced songs differentially, my guess is it would alienate the people they're trying to entice into legal downloads. However, the price can't persist. Only nutty fans or compulsives will want all the songs by an artist from every single album. Rather than get $0.00 for these songs, companies will prefer to take something between $0.00 and $.99.
I wonder if the companies couldn't use existing sales data (they certainly should be able to use the new download data) to estimate a true market price for songs a la the stock market. My

After three sweet releases of soothing tones in songs so summery it’s like dipping your toes in a warm country pond, Norah Jones locates her inner darkness on The Fall.
Inspired in some part by her breakup with long-term beau and bassist Lee Alexander, The Fall [Angel Records] casts the Norah we once knew into a strung out, deliciously dark world of torrid drumming, sultry Wurlitzer (often played by keyboard wizard James Poyser), angelic space sounds, and the strange, nightmarish guitars of Marc Ribot and Smokey Hormel, creating an aura of sonic hallucination and mental dislocation. Norah’s always gorgeous vocals and darker subject matter are encapsulated anew in a kind of beat-driven, electric swamp music. It’s like Louisiana by way of England: New Orleans-era Daniel Lanois productions meet Dusty Springfield and a postmodern Massive Attack.
But Norah Jones hasn’t completely forgotten her old fans while cultivating new ones. “December,” “Man of the Hour,” and “You’ve Ruined Me” will appease those who still prefer their Norah sweet and simple.
Demos for The Fall began at Jones’ Manhattan home studio in May 2008, with engineer Tom Schick manning her custom Neve console (with 1073 modules), Otari 2-inch 24-track MTR- 90, and a sumptuous collection of vintage tube mics (Neumann M 49, U 47, and Telefunken ELA M 250).

Joe Boyd, who produced the McGarrigles’ first two albums, assembled the material for the third disc in addition to serving as producer for the whole set. Tell My Sister is now available for pre-order in the Nonesuch Store, along with an exclusive, limited-edition commemorative poster.
The release coincides with a two-night tribute to Kate McGarrigle—who died of sarcoma last year—May 12 and 13 at New York City’s Town Hall. Curated by Joe Boyd, the concerts will feature performances by Kate’s children, Martha and Rufus Wainwright, and her sister Anna, as well as Emmylou Harris, Antony Hegarty, Norah Jones, and Teddy Thompson, among others. Profits from the concerts will go toward creating the Kate McGarrigle Sarcoma Research Fund.
Raised in an artistic family in St. Sauveur, Quebec, Kate moved to New York in 1969 to pursue a singing career while Anna studied art in Montreal. Both wrote many songs during this period, including Anna’s “Heart Like a Wheel,” which eventually appeared on their debut album (and was made famous by Linda Ronstadt in 1974), and Kate’s “The Work Song,” which Maria Muldaur recorded in 1973.

Her low-key track is accompanied by the sound of the piano that is also being played by the singer. Drummer Brian Blade, bassist Christopher Thomas, organist Pete Remm, and trumpeter Dave Guy also contributed to "It Was You."
In June, Jones released "My Heart Is Full." The track served as her collaboration with Thomas Bartlett. As of late, the singer has not yet talked about her forthcoming album, but the fact that she unveiled two songs suggests that she will be releasing a full compilation in the coming months.
Her 2016 album Day Breaks featured the songs "Burn," "Tragedy," "Flipside," "It's A Wonderful Time For Love," "And Then There Was You," "Don't Be Denied," "Day Breaks," "Peace," "Once I Had A Laugh," "Sleeping Wild," "Carry On," and "Fleurette Africaine."
Following the album's release, Jones talked about Day Breaks and said that it is a continued evolution and not a throwback album. Day Breaks was likened to Jones' debut album, and it features nine originals and six covers.
"The goal was to do everything live, get really good takes. When you have great musicians there's no reason to overdub. That strips the soul out of the music," said Jones.

I find it interesting how just hearing a voice can have a profound emotional affect. I guess it's similar to how music can have a similar affect. I imagine someone must have done studies on why music can have emotional influence on people, although off-hand I'm not familiar with any.
The whole voice thing reminds me of a time years ago when I was a teenager and I was watching some TV program on PBS where they were interviewing different people.

Sera Cahoone’s new album Deer Creek Canyon has enough steel guitar to make it country; aside from that, it’s also a really pure and beautiful element of gentle songwriting and sweet vocals.
The title track “Deer Creek Canyon” has an upbeat yet still gentle strum pattern that gives it a wonderful country music vibe. The imagery in the first verse puts listeners in mind of the wide open American west. “I know you’re right… might just take a little time.” It’s about navigating life and relationships with a sort of upbeat solemnity. It feels right.
One of my favorite aspects of this album is that it switches between what I’d call “honest to goodness country music” and a nearly-morbid stripped down acoustic style. One of the really good country-flavored tunes is “Nervous Wreck,” the title itself a reflection of a colloquial phrase. “I’ll be alright but I’m a nervous wreck.” It sounds like the hill country, complete with a well-played banjo and some hand claps. It’s a really fun tune and confesses the uncertainty that many people feel.
“And Still We Move” slows things down, but keeps the twangy steel guitar. You might feel like you’re at a high school dance, but it’s a country school. In all seriousness,

Vice President Annette Lu (呂秀蓮) has apparently backtracked on her recent comments yesterday, acknowledging that the Aboriginal people were the first people in Taiwan after activists announced plans for a 3,000-person strong protest scheduled for today on Ketagalan Blvd.
The uproar began after Lu made comments earlier this month saying that Taiwan's Aborigines were not the nation's first inhabitants, and that victims of Tropical Storm Mindulle living in mountainous areas should move to Central America. The statements drew protests from Aboriginal communities and representatives.
Since then, the communities have repeatedly asked Lu to apologize for her remarks and acknowledge that the Aboriginal peoples were the first native people of Taiwan.
Lu has steadfastly refused to apologize, although Chen has asked the Aboriginal community to forgive Lu for her "unintended" words.
In an interview which will be aired tonight at 8pm on the public television station PTS, Lu reiterated her claim that her words were not directed at or intended to harm the Aboriginal people of Taiwan, and thus she has no reason to apologize.
Her refusal has led Aboriginal lawmakers to publicly call into question the commitment of the Chen administration to promoting Aboriginal causes.
Lu did however, seem to be trying to play down the controversy yesterday afternoon by deviating from her steadfast insistence that she was justified in claiming that Taiwan's indigenous people were not the first people to

…and the legend of STEMA ….
Wine Cellar Stema Starosel appeared on the wine map of Bulgaria at the end of 2011.
The village of Starosel is where the ancient Thracians erected a temple with dredged wine sharpens more than 2,000 years ago.
In 2009 three partners started the reconstruction of the former public oven in the village, located in the center and turned it into a wine cellar. The work on repairing and rebuilding was slow because the oven has been out of business and abandoned for many years. It would have been easier to knock it off completely, but it would have wiped out the history of the building with the chimney and the stork nest.
As a result of the effort the business partners received a completely renovated wine-making building and a small restaurant, plus a beautiful courtyard surrounded by the green of the bend of the Pyasachnik River, in which many objects are related to wine making and the lifestyle connected with it.

Vice President Annette Lu (呂秀蓮) has apparently backtracked on her recent comments yesterday, acknowledging that the Aboriginal people were the first people in Taiwan after activists announced plans for a 3,000-person strong protest scheduled for today on Ketagalan Blvd.
The uproar began after Lu made comments earlier this month saying that Taiwan's Aborigines were not the nation's first inhabitants, and that victims of Tropical Storm Mindulle living in mountainous areas should move to Central America. The statements drew protests from Aboriginal communities and representatives.
Since then, the communities have repeatedly asked Lu to apologize for her remarks and acknowledge that the Aboriginal peoples were the first native people of Taiwan.
Lu has steadfastly refused to apologize, although Chen has asked the Aboriginal community to forgive Lu for her "unintended" words.
In an interview which will be aired tonight at 8pm on the public television station PTS, Lu reiterated her claim that her words were not directed at or intended to harm the Aboriginal people of Taiwan, and thus she has no reason to apologize.
Her refusal has led Aboriginal lawmakers to publicly call into question the commitment of the Chen administration to promoting Aboriginal causes.
Lu did however, seem to be trying to play down the controversy yesterday afternoon by deviating from her steadfast insistence that she was justified in claiming that Taiwan's indigenous people were not the first people to

Wine Cellar Stema Starosel appeared on the wine map of Bulgaria at the end of 2011.
The village of Starosel is where the ancient Thracians erected a temple with dredged wine sharpens more than 2,000 years ago.
In 2009 three partners started the reconstruction of the former public oven in the village, located in the center and turned it into a wine cellar. The work on repairing and rebuilding was slow because the oven has been out of business and abandoned for many years. It would have been easier to knock it off completely, but it would have wiped out the history of the building with the chimney and the stork nest.
As a result of the effort the business partners received a completely renovated wine-making building and a small restaurant, plus a beautiful courtyard surrounded by the green of the bend of the Pyasachnik River, in which many objects are related to wine making and the lifestyle connected with it.

This clone originated in Yarrawonga Victoria. The SAB member Marsha (who was previously known by the username “Yowie” led PD to the Fields collection, where the mother plant of this clone grew. The clone is easily recognized by the pair of spines, that makes it very different from other clones that belong to this species. However, similar plants can be found all across Australia (and the world), so it´s not really sure if it is actually a clone or just represents a local type. I know similar (and almost identical) Pachanois, especially from Ecuador and it may be very well possible that they are not genetically identical to the Yowie clone. If you encounter similar plants, you can just test it by trying to breed it with a verified Yowie.

Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for authorship analysis. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic $n$-grams, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, PV-DM, PV-DBOW, word2vec representations, and other baselines.

The new game mode, dubbed “Capital Supremacy,” will double-down on Clone Wars fantasy over two unique phases. "The first will see two teams of 20, plus 12 AI soldiers on each side, vie for control of five separate command posts spread across Geonosis’ sprawling surface; once a team has taken a majority of those posts, they can then progress to the second phase, which tasks them with boarding the opposition’s capital ship before trying to take it out by setting timed explosive charges."You read more about the new updates here.

The clone is easily recognized by the pair of spines, that makes it very different from other clones that belong to this species. However, similar plants can be found all across Australia (and the world), so it´s not really sure if it is actually a clone or just represents a local type. I know similar (and almost identical) Pachanois, especially from Ecuador and it may be very well possible that they are not genetically identical to the Yowie clone.

In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for authorship analysis. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic $n$-grams, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, PV-DM, PV-DBOW, word2vec representations, and other baselines.

Depending on your system specs softmpu might not be a choice at all as you need a 386+ system to use it. You can always experiment with it and then decide what to do.
Thank you for your answers. Since I'd like to have the sound as original/authentic as possible, I will definitely need to get an ISA MPU-card. Will the breakout-box (IPC-T) become obsolete then or do I still need it for proper functionality?

I especially like the conclusion that he arrives at in the end, that it was too bad that he couldn't have done more, but his actions produced a much, much better result than if he had done nothing at all. Good job.
My take on the Gojyo-Hakkai relationship comes mostly from the part early on in the Kami-sama arc when Goku and Hakkai are in the desert dreamscape inside the gourd. Hakkai is so clearly in loco parentis, and when he changes back from his youkai form, Goku is hugging him and saying he likes the regular Hakkai better. And in fact, he seems fascinated by Hakkai from the first - by the fact that he can fight more effectively than you'd guess, and that he has such pretty eyes. So I was thinking that this horrific scene would weigh pretty heavily on him, but that he'd be stretching himself to understand as much as he could. And Sanzo has given little indications that he really can be a very effective teacher, when he calms down.

Dragon Ball Z has such loyal fans that any game with the Dragon Ball Z moniker automatically sells well, no matter how bad. This is what licensed games are all about: making money on the strength of the brand instead of the strength of the game.
Then along came Dragon Ball Z: Budokai (which basically means "tournament") for the Playstation 2. It sold exceptionally well, even for DBZ, so Atari decided to update the graphics and release it on the Nintendo GameCube, where it went on to sell over a million copies and become Player's Choice.
The GameCube version is the preferred release, as the developer Dimps took the opportunity to implement cel-shading, making the game look more like the anime than the Playstation 2 version. I will be playing the GameCube version.

Mr. Sanzo: We exist specifically to address what we see as a void in the marketplace, and that is to provide comprehensive IT solutions to outpatient-specialized health care organizations. When we say, “specialized,” we do not mean specialty care, such as orthopedics. We address health care providers whose practices follow a complex workflow. These healthcare professionals are not well served by generic IT solutions. Instead, they require a solution that is perfectly fitted to that practice, that healthcare setting and the needs of that vertical. We came to this strategy in our early days. We were totally focused on providing that end-to-end solution for outpatient wound care centers. By providing that perfectly fitted solution, we captured over 80 percent of the penetrated market and maintained a retention rate in the high 90 percent. When we decided to expand into other market segments, it was natural for us to limit our interest in clinical verticals that, like the outpatient wound care market, were highly specialized in their workflow.
We identified a number of possible specialized markets to consider. Those that we have chosen to invest in, include occupational medicine, urgent care, hospital employee health, workplace health (which is when employers take responsibility for the care of their employees) and therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech and language pathology.) Each of these clinical markets share the common characteristics of being predominately outpatient based and requiring a complex workflow that must be supported by specialized IT solutions.

Definitely not as powerful IMO. Before Super, SSJ4 might have been considered on par with super saiyan red, but blue? Nah.
Ever since they obtained godly ki, Goku's and Vegeta's entire SSJ system changed, so it's hard to say.
If you're talking about before they achieved that, then no; SSJ4 is a powerful transformation, but they were much weaker at the start of Super than they were in GT.
SSJ4's with GT power levels would probably fare pretty well even without GK, like Golden Frieza did.
SSJ4 GT Goku would one shot any God from Super. In DBS, Beerus stated he used 10% of his power on enraged SSJ2 Vegeta. I think Beerus was using 10% the whole time but only NEEDED it against Vegeta, as opposed to Goku where it was a complete stomp. I would put enraged SSJ2 Vegeta at 3/4 of Beerus's 10%, while SSJ3 Goku would be at 1/4 of Beerus's 10%. Akira stated Beerus would be a 10 and God Goku would be a 6, meaning God Goku would be equal to Beerus at 60%. So for Goku to go from 2.5% of Beerus's full power to 60% he would need a multiplier of 24x SSJ3. That means that MSSJ GT Goku is stronger than God Goku.

Deities in "Dragon Ball Super" are quite different than deities from the real world. Whis and Beerus like to visit Earth and partake in the feasts. They are quite comical in a weird way that you can't find them holy. And what's more, is that they train two powerful mortals just so they can beat the heck out of the God Of Destruction. What's even more bizarre about this is that it seems like Goku is actually waltzing his way to become a deity. How can he perfect Ultra Instinct in a short amount of time when Gods can't even use the form properly?
So far, there are only two mortals that seem to have this form; one confirmed and one speculated.
Goku is confirmed to have the form but is only limited as to when he can use it. Jiren, on the other hand, is not confirmed to have this form but seems that he has the characteristics of a UI user. What's more interesting is they are both mortals. How can mortals achieve and master Ultra Instinct more easily than the Gods of Destruction?
The first reason might be because mortals can find themselves in desperate situations during a fight. Beerus can never have that thrill. Goku feels when he's fighting an opponent more powerful than him because Beerus is already so powerful.

Despite no longer being a god, Goku is still able to hold his own against Beerus due to his absorption of the godly powers into his body and adapting them for himself.

Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the layers of tissue (pleura) that line the outside of the lungs and walls of the chest (thoracic) cavity. Too much fluid in the pleural space can make breathing hard or painful.
Extra fluid may be drained from the pleural space by thoracentesis. In some cases, a tube is placed in the chest to drain the extra fluid and typically stays in place for several days.
A minimally invasive surgery technique known as thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), performed under general anesthesia, can manage recurring or hard-to-drain pleural effusion. Doctors can also use this procedure to diagnose pleural effusion if less invasive tests have been unsuccessful.
To treat pleural effusion that is uncontrollable or recurs due to cancer despite drainage, a tunneled pleural catheter, which allows repeated drainage as needed at home, may be inserted. Another option is to instill a scarring or sclerosing agent, a type of drug that deliberately induces scarring, into the pleural cavity through a tube (thoracostomy), either in the operating room or at bedside, to fuse the lung lining and chest wall, obliterating the space where fluid recollected.
If pleural effusion is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed. If pleural effusion is caused by a heart condition, other medications will be prescribed.
If untreated, pleural effusion can lead to serious health problems, such as a chronically collapsed lung (trapped lung).

The lung is covered with 2 sheets of tissue called the pleura. These normally produce a small amount of fluid which lubricate the lungs and helps us to breathe. When cancer spreads to the pleura it causes too much fluid to be made. This collection of fluid is called a pleural effusion.
A pleural effusion stops the lungs expanding properly and this makes it more difficult for people to breathe. A doctor can put a tube called a chest drain into the space between the 2 pleura (called the pleural space). This drains off the extra fluid, helping a person to breathe more easily. But the fluid can build up again.
Doctors can try and prevent this from happening by putting sterile talc into the pleural space. This is called pleurodesis . This helps the pleura stick together and so there is no space for the fluid to collect.
Another way to treat a pleural effusion is to put a small plastic tube called an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) under the skin into the pleural space. A connection on the end of this tube means that a district nurse or carer can attach a bottle onto the connection to drain off the fluid when needed.

Approximately 75% of all mesotheliomas diagnosed are pleural mesotheliomas. Pleural mesothelioma is most commonly unilateral (on one side of the chest), and occurs most often in men age 60-80 with a history of asbestos exposure, often decades prior to diagnosis.
When pleural mesothelioma begins, it appears as a series of small white nodules which become diffuse, or widespread on the pleural surface. Gradually, these nodules begin to grow together and thicken, forming a “rind” that encases the lung and extends into the fissures or grooves of the pleura and the diaphragm. The tumor spreads by direct invasion of surrounding tissue, inwardly compressing the lung, and outwardly invading the chest wall and ribs.
The early symptoms of pleural mesothelioma are not, as a rule, specific enough to cause alarm, and in most cases are attributed to increasing age or overwork. Because of this, it may be several months from the onset of generalized symptoms until the first acute symptom, pleural effusion, occurs. At that time, progressive shortness of breath caused by the effusion, and chest pain caused by chest wall invasion may be in evidence. More general symptoms include dry cough, fatigue, night sweats and weight loss.

The fluid itself can be seen at the bottom of the lung or lungs, hiding the normal lung structure. If heart failure is present, the x-ray shadow of the heart will be enlarged. An ultrasound scan may disclose a small effusion that caused no abnormal findings during chest examination. A computed tomography scan is very helpful if the lungs themselves are diseased.
In order to learn what has caused the effusion, a needle or catheter is often used to obtain a fluid sample, which is examined for cells and its chemical make-up. This procedure, called a thoracentesis, is the way to determine whether an effusion is a transudate or exudate, giving a clue as to the underlying cause. In some cases--for instance when cancer or bacterial infection is present--the specific cause can be determined and the correct treatment planned. Culturing a fluid sample can identify the bacteria that cause tuberculosis or other forms of pleural infection. The next diagnostic step is to take a tissue sample, or pleural biopsy, and examine it under a microscope. If the effusion is caused by lung disease, placing a viewing tube (bronchoscope) through the large air passages will allow the examiner to see the abnormal appearance of the lungs.

Pleural effusion happens when too much fluid collects between the chest cavity and the lungs. Depending on the cause, the fluid can be transudate (a watery fluid), exudate (a protein-rich fluid), lymphatic (a milky fluid), pus or blood. Pleural effusion is sometimes called fluid in the chest, pleural fluid or fluid around the lungs.
Pleural effusion can be caused by certain medications such as Vasotec. Vasotec is found in a group of medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are prescribed to patients suffering from hypertension or congestive heart failure. ACE inhibitors signal the kidneys to produce a protein called renin. Angiotensin production responds to the increase of renin in the body. These proteins trigger the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone. Aldosterone is a hormone that causes kidneys to retain sodium, which leads to water retention. Water retention triggers health problems such as pleural effusion.
Vasotec and pleural effusion share some of the same side effects and symptoms. The most common symptoms of pleural effusion as a side effect of Vasotec are chest pain and shortness of breath.

There are a number of factors that may cause this condition and pleurisy recovery time may vary, depending on the underlying conditions.
Your pleura consist of a double-layer moist membrane that covers your lungs and lines your chest cavity. Inflammation of this membrane is called pleurisy. The pleural membranes have a space between the two layers, which is filled with a thin fluid that helps them glide gently against each other.
When the pleura are inflamed, every breath, sneeze, or cough causes the roughened surfaces to rub against each other, causing pain. In some cases, excess fluid seeps into the pleural space, leading to pleural effusion. Excess fluid accumulation puts pressure against the lungs and reduces their ability to expand, causing shortness of breath. In some patients, infection of the excessive fluid in the pleura also occurs.
Pleurisy recovery time depends on the cause. Pleurisy that is associated with pleurodynia usually comes and goes over a few days, but in rare cases, the chest pain can occur over several weeks. Patients with rheumatic fever or bacterial pneumonia experience pleurisy that typically goes away with antibiotic treatment.

This condition can cause fluid buildup in the lungs which results in chest pain, cough, shortness of breath and fever. Why is a pleural effusion dangerous? A healthy body will produce something called pleural fluid in order to lubricate the lining of the lungs. This lubrication is necessary for healthy lungs, but too much of that fluid can actually "drown" the lungs.
There are two major types of pleural effusions. The first is a transudative effusion. This lung fluid leak is caused by pressure or low protein in the blood vessels. Those who suffer from congestive heart failure may experience this form of effusion. The other is exudative effusion, and it is caused by blocked blood vessels. These blood vessels can become blocked because of inflammation, an injury or an adverse reaction to a drug.

By incorporating an ultrasonic delivery catheter into a chest tube, the invention improves the efficiency, speed, and outcomes associated with the drainage of pleural effusions.
A chest tube is required for drainage of excess of fluid accumulation around the lungs inside the chest wall (pleural effusion). The excess fluids can be caused by injury, infection, heart failure, or other diseases. The most common pleural effusions are hemothorax (blood), empyema (pus), and malignancy.
Treatment for loculated pleural effusions (fixed, isolated pockets) is typically thoracentesis - drainage of the pleural space via puncture through the skin with a percutaneous catheter or a surgical chest tube. Doctors can also administer intrapleural fibrinolytic agents to disrupt the clot formation, thus causing the clot to dissolve and drain more easily. If these treatments fail, the risk of epyema increases, particularly when blood remains resulting in a retained hemothorax. The final therapeutic option is an invasive surgical procedure, Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS).
The use of fibrinolytic agents and thoracentesis is not without controversy. Specifically, if the chest tube and fibrinolytic agents are unsuccessful, then surgical intervention will be delayed. A delay of treatment can significantly impact the outcome of the patient. Additionally, fibrinolytic agents have an increased risk of hemorrhage.

They say you can die from pneumonia, but what do they mean by that? Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics, but sometimes not all the bacteria is killed off by the antibiotics and the pneumonia can return.
Pneumonia also causes inflammation in the lungs. If the inflammation remains, your body will fight back by developing what is called pleural effusion. Pleural effusion occurs when inflammation causes fluid to accumulate between the lungs and the lung linings. If the pleural effusion is not treated and remains, it will indeed thicken and form nodules or plaques. This thickening is called "pleural thickening".
What, Exactly Is Pleural Thickening?
The lining of the lungs, called the pleura or pleural membranes, consist of thin membranes that cover the lungs and provide protection and support. Some diseases such as bacterial pneumonia can cause these membranes to thicken, often as a result of inflammation.
So pleural thickening is the thickening and hardening of the pleura or pleural fluids.
1. Diffuse pleural thickening extends over a large area and may restrict expansion of the lungs.
2. Pleural Plaques are localized areas of pleural thickening / calcification which do not usually interfer with breathing.
To diagnose the condition a doctor will use an imaging test such as an MRI or a CT scan, and may also take a fine needle biopsy of the lung tissue. Pleural thickening is considered to be a life threatening condition.

They can be caused by several mechanisms including increased permeability of the pleural membrane, increased pulmonary capillary pressure, decreased negative intrapleural pressure, decreased oncotic pressure, and obstructed lymphatic flow.
A transudative pleural effusion occurs when the balance of hydrostatic forces influencing the formation and absorption of pleural fluid is altered to favour pleural fluid accumulation. The permeability of the capillaries to proteins is normal. (Common causes - left ventricular failure (LVF), liver cirrhosis, hypoalbuminaemia and peritoneal dialysis).
In contrast, an exudative pleural effusion develops when the pleural surface and/or the local capillary permeability are altered. (Common causes - malignancy and parapneumonic effusions).
The differential diagnosis of an effusion is wide, and may include pulmonary, pleural or extrapulmonary disease. Please contact local Respiratory team early to guide aspiration and further systematic investigation and management (see flow diagram below).

In this article, the authors described pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the rare cases of black pleural effusion. The importance of this review arises from the need to provide physicians with a guide to suspect, diagnose, and treat the rare unfamiliar serious cases of pleural effusion. Black pleural effusion may hide different critical diseases with different strategies for diagnosis and treatment.
We would like to thank the authors for their great work to clarify the important clinical aspects of black pleural effusion. In addition, we would like to provide some critical points that could not reduce the significance of this review article; however, it may support its aim and conclusion. On searching PubMed only, the authors found nine case reports, three abstracts, and 1 review; however, the authors did not mention the search items and the date of their search. When we searched other medical search engines for keywords of (black pleural effusion) in all fields of the published articles, we found 16 case reports and 3 meeting abstracts, but the authors did not include in their article,,, thus the authors should target other search engines to determine more published cases of black pleural effusion. We found three more cases of black pleural effusion published in the year 2016 and 2017.

We present three pediatric patients presenting predominantly with recurrent hemoptysis and/or chest pain who were ultimately diagnosed with mediastinal teratoma containing pancreatic tissue. All three patients were initially suspected to have tuberculosis or empyema, and underwent relevant treatment, but without improvement. Patient 1 had left hilar enlargement, and subsequently an enlarging calcified cavity within high-density consolidation was identified. Patient 2 initially presented with right-sided pulmonary consolidation and pleuritis, and subsequently developed right lower lobe calcification, pleural thickening, and irregular soft tissue in the right inferior mediastinum. Patient 3 was initially found to have right lobe consolidation accompanied by a massive right-sided pleural effusion with extremely elevated inflammatory markers in serum and pleural effusion.

For many years, asbestos was used in insulation, in car brakes, in ships, in refractory materials and many other items. After 1970s its use declined dramatically. This is due to the fact that science has shown that exposure to asbestos can cause serious health problems.
How can someone be exposed to asbestos?
Usually the exposure to asbestos is related to one’s occupation. Asbestos is found in several construction materials. So, people who work using these materials may be exposed to asbestos. These can be plumbers, electricians, people who install insulation and several others. Moreover, one can indirectly be exposed to asbestos through contact with the clothes of someone else who is directly exposed as those of previous occupations. For example, this can happen when an employee brings his clothes home for washing. Moreover, one can be exposed to low levels of asbestos found in nature.
What health problems can occur due to exposure to asbestos?
Asbestosis – essentially scarring of lungs – fibrosis, which eventually causes shortness of breath.
Cancer – This includes lung cancer and mesothelioma which is a rare form of cancer involving the tissue around the lungs.

There is always a small amount of fluid in this space. However, having too much fluid in the pleural space can prevent your lungs from fully expanding and make it hard to breathe.
The fluid buildup in PPE is caused by pneumonia.
What’s the difference between parapneumonic effusion and empyema?
PPE is a buildup of fluid in the pleural cavity. Empyema is a buildup of pus — a thick yellow-white liquid made up of bacteria and dead white blood cells. It’s also caused by pneumonia.
You can develop empyema if PPE isn’t treated quickly enough. Between 5 and 10 percent of people with PPE get empyema.
Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. The fluid may be cloudy or clear, and it doesn’t contain bacteria. PPE will get better when you take antibiotics to treat pneumonia.
Complicated parapneumonic effusions. Bacteria have traveled from the lungs into the pleural space, causing a buildup of fluid and white blood cells. The fluid is cloudy. It will need to be drained.
Empyema thoracis. Thick, whitish-yellow pus builds up in the pleural space. This can happen if pneumonia isn’t treated quickly enough.
Because these are also symptoms of pneumonia, the doctor may need to do a chest X-ray or ultrasound to find out for sure if you have PPE.

Even after exposure to asbestos has ceased, symptoms of asbestos-related disease may continue to progress. If you have been exposed to asbestos and are a smoker, your chances of developing lung cancer are greatly increased.
If you believe that you are suffering from exposure to asbestos then it's important to get a medical diagnosis confirming the condition. Asbestosis predisposes sufferers to cancer (lung cancer, mesothelioma) therefore it's also important to get frequent chest and lung testing to detect adverse developments.
A chest x-ray may be used to detect lung and pleural disease caused by exposure to asbestos. X-rays often show pleural changes and other lung abnormalities (pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening and pleural effusions) in people who have been exposed to asbestos.

The pleura lines the chest cavity and is the layer of tissue that borders the lungs. These layers of tissue that make up the pleura rub together when a person breathes in and out. This causes no discomfort when the pleural layers are healthy, but if they develop an infection or become inflamed, the condition can be quite miserable.
Pleurisy is also called pleuritis and can develop for a variety of reasons. Oftentimes, pleurisy occurs as the result of an infection. This can be a viral infection like influenza or a bacterial infection like pneumonia.
Bronchitis can also cause pleurisy as can tuberculosis and certain immune disorders. Pleurisy can also develop when a person suffers from a chest wound, blunt trauma to the chest, or fractured ribs. Tumors and cancer in the chest cavity or lungs could also potentially cause pleurisy.
The most common symptom of pleurisy is chest pain. This chest pain can vary in type and in severity. Sometimes, a person may experience severe and sharp chest pain that worsens when a person breathes. Coughing and sneezing can also elicit sharp pain when a person is suffering from pleurisy.
Some people may also experience shortness of breath. Most of the time, the shortness of breath is caused by the person either consciously or unconsciously trying to minimize the size of their breaths to avoid the pain that it causes.

A univariate analysis was performed，and logistic regression analysis was used to determine statistical significance. Results There were 46 patients in the PPE group and 230 in the NPPE group. The univariate analysis indicated that differences in age，gender，white blood cell count，platelet count，and serum alanine aminotransferase were not statistically significant（P > 0.05）between the two groups. The differences in hyponatremia，hypoproteinemia，serum procalcitonin levels，and CURB-65 scores were statistically significant（P < 0.05）.

Once this fluid is removed the individual can normally breathe better and the fluid is sent off for examination. On many occasions a doctor is unable to tell from the pleural fluid removed from the lung whether or not the fluid contains cancerous cells. On those occasions, it is necessary for the physicians to perform an open biopsy upon the lung tissue in order to extract a sample from the pleural tissue covering the lung and have that sent off for examination. Pathologists with special training who are familiar with special staining techniques can then determine if the type of cancer producing the fluid on the lung is in fact mesothelioma or some other form of cancer.

Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the layers of tissue (pleura) that line the outside of the lungs and walls of the chest (thoracic) cavity. Too much fluid in the pleural space can make breathing hard or painful.
Extra fluid may be drained from the pleural space by thoracentesis. In some cases, a tube is placed in the chest to drain the extra fluid and typically stays in place for several days.
A minimally invasive surgery technique known as thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), performed under general anesthesia, can manage recurring or hard-to-drain pleural effusion. Doctors can also use this procedure to diagnose pleural effusion if less invasive tests have been unsuccessful.
To treat pleural effusion that is uncontrollable or recurs due to cancer despite drainage, a tunneled pleural catheter, which allows repeated drainage as needed at home, may be inserted. Another option is to instill a scarring or sclerosing agent, a type of drug that deliberately induces scarring, into the pleural cavity through a tube (thoracostomy), either in the operating room or at bedside, to fuse the lung lining and chest wall, obliterating the space where fluid recollected.
If pleural effusion is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed. If pleural effusion is caused by a heart condition, other medications will be prescribed.

The lung is covered with 2 sheets of tissue called the pleura. These normally produce a small amount of fluid which lubricate the lungs and helps us to breathe. When cancer spreads to the pleura it causes too much fluid to be made. This collection of fluid is called a pleural effusion.
A pleural effusion stops the lungs expanding properly and this makes it more difficult for people to breathe. A doctor can put a tube called a chest drain into the space between the 2 pleura (called the pleural space). This drains off the extra fluid, helping a person to breathe more easily. But the fluid can build up again.
Doctors can try and prevent this from happening by putting sterile talc into the pleural space. This is called pleurodesis . This helps the pleura stick together and so there is no space for the fluid to collect.
Another way to treat a pleural effusion is to put a small plastic tube called an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) under the skin into the pleural space. A connection on the end of this tube means that a district nurse or carer can attach a bottle onto the connection to drain off the fluid when needed.

Approximately 75% of all mesotheliomas diagnosed are pleural mesotheliomas. Pleural mesothelioma is most commonly unilateral (on one side of the chest), and occurs most often in men age 60-80 with a history of asbestos exposure, often decades prior to diagnosis.
When pleural mesothelioma begins, it appears as a series of small white nodules which become diffuse, or widespread on the pleural surface. Gradually, these nodules begin to grow together and thicken, forming a “rind” that encases the lung and extends into the fissures or grooves of the pleura and the diaphragm. The tumor spreads by direct invasion of surrounding tissue, inwardly compressing the lung, and outwardly invading the chest wall and ribs.
The early symptoms of pleural mesothelioma are not, as a rule, specific enough to cause alarm, and in most cases are attributed to increasing age or overwork. Because of this, it may be several months from the onset of generalized symptoms until the first acute symptom, pleural effusion, occurs. At that time, progressive shortness of breath caused by the effusion, and chest pain caused by chest wall invasion may be in evidence. More general symptoms include dry cough, fatigue, night sweats and weight loss.

The fluid itself can be seen at the bottom of the lung or lungs, hiding the normal lung structure. If heart failure is present, the x-ray shadow of the heart will be enlarged. An ultrasound scan may disclose a small effusion that caused no abnormal findings during chest examination. A computed tomography scan is very helpful if the lungs themselves are diseased.
In order to learn what has caused the effusion, a needle or catheter is often used to obtain a fluid sample, which is examined for cells and its chemical make-up. This procedure, called a thoracentesis, is the way to determine whether an effusion is a transudate or exudate, giving a clue as to the underlying cause. In some cases--for instance when cancer or bacterial infection is present--the specific cause can be determined and the correct treatment planned. Culturing a fluid sample can identify the bacteria that cause tuberculosis or other forms of pleural infection. The next diagnostic step is to take a tissue sample, or pleural biopsy, and examine it under a microscope. If the effusion is caused by lung disease, placing a viewing tube (bronchoscope) through the large air passages will allow the examiner to see the abnormal appearance of the lungs.

The small amount of fluid serves as lubrication to help ease breathing. It allows the lungs to expand and contract more easily. Pleural effusion happens when too much fluid collects between the chest cavity and the lungs. Depending on the cause, the fluid can be transudate (a watery fluid), exudate (a protein-rich fluid), lymphatic (a milky fluid), pus or blood. Pleural effusion is sometimes called fluid in the chest, pleural fluid or fluid around the lungs.
Pleural effusion can be caused by certain medications such as Vasotec. Vasotec is found in a group of medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are prescribed to patients suffering from hypertension or congestive heart failure. ACE inhibitors signal the kidneys to produce a protein called renin. Angiotensin production responds to the increase of renin in the body. These proteins trigger the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone. Aldosterone is a hormone that causes kidneys to retain sodium, which leads to water retention. Water retention triggers health problems such as pleural effusion.
Vasotec and pleural effusion share some of the same side effects and symptoms. The most common symptoms of pleural effusion as a side effect of Vasotec are chest pain and shortness of breath. Breathing may become more difficult when lying down. Some people suffering from drug-induced pleural effusion experience continuous chest pain. Other people only experience chest pain when breathing

The lungs and chest cavity are covered by thin, moist membranes called the pleura. Inflammation of these membranes or pleurisy may occur when it is irritated, causing chest pain during breathing. There are a number of factors that may cause this condition and pleurisy recovery time may vary, depending on the underlying conditions.
Your pleura consist of a double-layer moist membrane that covers your lungs and lines your chest cavity. Inflammation of this membrane is called pleurisy. The pleural membranes have a space between the two layers, which is filled with a thin fluid that helps them glide gently against each other.
When the pleura are inflamed, every breath, sneeze, or cough causes the roughened surfaces to rub against each other, causing pain. In some cases, excess fluid seeps into the pleural space, leading to pleural effusion. Excess fluid accumulation puts pressure against the lungs and reduces their ability to expand, causing shortness of breath. In some patients, infection of the excessive fluid in the pleura also occurs.
Pleurisy recovery time depends on the cause. Pleurisy that is associated with pleurodynia usually comes and goes over a few days, but in rare cases, the chest pain can occur over several weeks. Patients with rheumatic fever or bacterial pneumonia experience pleurisy that typically goes away with antibiotic treatment.

This condition can cause fluid buildup in the lungs which results in chest pain, cough, shortness of breath and fever. Why is a pleural effusion dangerous? A healthy body will produce something called pleural fluid in order to lubricate the lining of the lungs. This lubrication is necessary for healthy lungs, but too much of that fluid can actually "drown" the lungs.
There are two major types of pleural effusions. The first is a transudative effusion. This lung fluid leak is caused by pressure or low protein in the blood vessels. Those who suffer from congestive heart failure may experience this form of effusion. The other is exudative effusion, and it is caused by blocked blood vessels. These blood vessels can become blocked because of inflammation, an injury or an adverse reaction to a drug.
How do I know if I have an effusion?
If you experience chest pain, persisting cough or irregular breathing patterns then it may be time you saw your doctor. Be thorough in your explanation of the symptoms that you are suffering from, so that your doctor has the best chance of a correct diagnosis.

Pleurisy and pleural effusion are generally only as serious as the underlying disease. Seek medical attention immediately if you haven’t already.
Each lung is surrounded by the double-layered pleura. Normally these membranes are in constant contact with each other as the lung moves in and out in the act of breathing. There is a small space between these two layers that allows this movement. But when the layers become inflamed their surfaces rub together disturbingly with every breath, sneeze, and cough. This condition is known as pleurisy.
Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid seeps into the pleural space. The added fluid puts tremendous pressure on the lungs, reducing their mobility and causing shortness of breath. This excess fluid can, in some cases of pleural effusion, become infected, causing a condition known as empyema.

By incorporating an ultrasonic delivery catheter into a chest tube, the invention improves the efficiency, speed, and outcomes associated with the drainage of pleural effusions.
A chest tube is required for drainage of excess of fluid accumulation around the lungs inside the chest wall (pleural effusion). The excess fluids can be caused by injury, infection, heart failure, or other diseases. The most common pleural effusions are hemothorax (blood), empyema (pus), and malignancy.
Treatment for loculated pleural effusions (fixed, isolated pockets) is typically thoracentesis - drainage of the pleural space via puncture through the skin with a percutaneous catheter or a surgical chest tube. Doctors can also administer intrapleural fibrinolytic agents to disrupt the clot formation, thus causing the clot to dissolve and drain more easily. If these treatments fail, the risk of epyema increases, particularly when blood remains resulting in a retained hemothorax. The final therapeutic option is an invasive surgical procedure, Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS).
The use of fibrinolytic agents and thoracentesis is not without controversy. Specifically, if the chest tube and fibrinolytic agents are unsuccessful, then surgical intervention will be delayed. A delay of treatment can significantly impact the outcome of the patient. Additionally, fibrinolytic agents have an increased risk of hemorrhage.

They say you can die from pneumonia, but what do they mean by that? Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics, but sometimes not all the bacteria is killed off by the antibiotics and the pneumonia can return.
Pneumonia also causes inflammation in the lungs. If the inflammation remains, your body will fight back by developing what is called pleural effusion. Pleural effusion occurs when inflammation causes fluid to accumulate between the lungs and the lung linings. If the pleural effusion is not treated and remains, it will indeed thicken and form nodules or plaques. This thickening is called "pleural thickening".
What, Exactly Is Pleural Thickening?
The lining of the lungs, called the pleura or pleural membranes, consist of thin membranes that cover the lungs and provide protection and support. Some diseases such as bacterial pneumonia can cause these membranes to thicken, often as a result of inflammation.
So pleural thickening is the thickening and hardening of the pleura or pleural fluids.
1. Diffuse pleural thickening extends over a large area and may restrict expansion of the lungs.
2. Pleural Plaques are localized areas of pleural thickening / calcification which do not usually interfer with breathing.
To diagnose the condition a doctor will use an imaging test such as an MRI or a CT scan, and may also take a fine needle biopsy of the lung tissue. Pleural thickening is considered to be a life threatening condition.

They can be caused by several mechanisms including increased permeability of the pleural membrane, increased pulmonary capillary pressure, decreased negative intrapleural pressure, decreased oncotic pressure, and obstructed lymphatic flow.
A transudative pleural effusion occurs when the balance of hydrostatic forces influencing the formation and absorption of pleural fluid is altered to favour pleural fluid accumulation. The permeability of the capillaries to proteins is normal. (Common causes - left ventricular failure (LVF), liver cirrhosis, hypoalbuminaemia and peritoneal dialysis).
In contrast, an exudative pleural effusion develops when the pleural surface and/or the local capillary permeability are altered. (Common causes - malignancy and parapneumonic effusions).

Your doctor might be able diagnose pleurisy based on your symptoms and by performing a physical examination. They may also organise some blood tests, and an X-ray or scans of your chest to find out the cause of the pleurisy.
Treatment of pleurisy depends on what is causing it.
If it caused by a viral infection, non-prescription painkillers can be used to manage your symptoms.
If it is caused by a bacterial infection, it will be treated with antibiotics.
If the pleurisy is caused by a build up of fluid in the lungs, it may be necessary to have a procedure to remove the fluid.
The most common symptom of pleurisy is a sharp chest pain that feels worse with breathing.

You should visit your doctor if you have chest pain that does not improve or gets worse after three to five days.
However, if your chest pain is accompanied by a high temperature, coughing up phlegm or blood, or breathing difficulties, you should seek immediate medical attention.
Your doctor can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy.

Question: can pleurisy be caused by anxiety? I was diagnosed with Pneumonia with pleural effusions and pericarditis with pericardial effusions 3 months ago. I was hospitalised twice with regular follow up appointments until the condition resolved itself. 2 days after my last hospitalisation I went back to the emergency department with mild pleuritic pain and was discharged the next morning as the doctors were happy that there was no fluid present and the pain was probably due to a spasm of some kind. I want to know can Pleuritic pain be caused by anxiety?
anxiety may cause any symptom, particularly if the patient is very anxious about it. For example a young patient like you, who has been in so much trouble, may interpret minor symptoms as major ones and may unwantedly exaggerate.
Pleuritic pain can be caused by either lung or heart problems (pleura or pericardium irritation). Sometimes the pain may precede fluid accumulation. Actually when fluid accumulates the pain may get 'softer'. If your symptoms persist - and particularly if you feel shortness of breath - I would advise you to check again.
Till then you should be reassured as the doctors have examined you and found no concerning evidence.

Methodse A total of 276 patients with CAP were enrolled. Based on the presence of PPE，they were divided into a PPE group and a non-PPE（NPPE）group. Age，gender，vital signs，initial laboratory results，length of stay，28-day mortality，and CURB-65 score were collected. A univariate analysis was performed，and logistic regression analysis was used to determine statistical significance. Results There were 46 patients in the PPE group and 230 in the NPPE group. The univariate analysis indicated that differences in age，gender，white blood cell count，platelet count，and serum alanine aminotransferase were not statistically significant（P > 0.05）between the two groups. The differences in hyponatremia，hypoproteinemia，serum procalcitonin levels，and CURB-65 scores were statistically significant（P < 0.05）. The logistic regression analysis revealed that hyponatremia，hypoproteinemia，and serum procalcitonin level were independent risk factors. The patients in the PPE group were more likely to be admitted（22.1% vs 7.5%，P < 0.05）and had longer hospital stays（median 16 days vs 5 days，P < 0.05）than those in the NPPE group. However，there was no difference in 28-day mortality between PPE and NPPE groups（8.6% vs 8.3%，P > 0.05）. Conclusion CAP patients with PPE in the emergency department were more likely to be admitted and had longer hospital stays，Hyponatremia，hypoproteinemia，and serum procalcitonin were independent risk factors for pleural effusion. Therefore，to decrease morbidity，as well as economic burden，we should pay more attention and provide earlier treatment to patients with PPE.

Many times this cancer will spread to other nearby tissues and organs as well as other sites in the body as it develops. Many asbestos victims initially go to their doctors or end up in the hospital in the emergency room complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath symptoms sometimes mimic pneumonia. Upon examination and x-ray it is frequently found that they have a pleural effusion (fluid on the lung). Once this fluid is removed the individual can normally breathe better and the fluid is sent off for examination. On many occasions a doctor is unable to tell from the pleural fluid removed from the lung whether or not the fluid contains cancerous cells. On those occasions, it is necessary for the physicians to perform an open biopsy upon the lung tissue in order to extract a sample from the pleural tissue covering the lung and have that sent off for examination. Pathologists with special training who are familiar with special staining techniques can then determine if the type of cancer producing the fluid on the lung is in fact mesothelioma or some other form of cancer. A proper pathological diagnosis must be made before treatment options can be determined.

Retrieved Text: The Achilles tendon, or tendon calcaneus, is a large ropelike band of fibrous tissue in the back of the ankle that connects the powerful calf muscles to the heel bone (calcaneus). Sometimes called the heel cord, it is the largest tendon in the human body. When the calf muscles contract, the Achilles tendon is tightened, pulling the heel. This allows you to point your foot and stand on tiptoe. It is vital to such activities as walking, running, and jumping. A complete tear through the tendon, which usually occurs about 2 inches above the heel bone, is called an Achilles tendon rupture.
The Achilles tendon can grow weak and thin with age and lack of use. Then it becomes prone to injury or rupture. Achilles tendon rupture is more common in those with preexisting tendinitis of the Achilles tendon. Certain illnesses (such as arthritis and diabetes) and medications (such as corticosteroids and some antibiotics, including quinolones such as levofloxacin [Levaquin] and ciprofloxacin [Cipro]) can also increase the risk of rupture.
Rupture most commonly occurs in the middle-aged male athlete (the weekend warrior who is engaging in a pickup game of basketball, for example). Injury often occurs during recreational sports that require bursts of jumping, pivoting, and running. Most often these are tennis, racquetball, basketball, and badminton.

Overview Achilles tendon rupture is an injury that affects the back of your lower leg. It most commonly occurs in people playing recreational sports. The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture). The tendon can rupture completely or just partially. If you have an Achilles tendon rupture, you might feel a pop or snap, followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and lower leg that usually affects your ability to walk properly.

It often occurs from overuse of the tendon, but can be caused by poor technique or using the wrong equipment during exercise. Certain antibiotics can also make your tendons more susceptible to the condition.
Achilles tendonitis usually begins as a mild pain in your heel, which gets worse following exercise. Over time you may begin to experience pain and tenderness more frequently. Exercise will provide some light relief, but in the long term it usually exacerbates symptoms.
Other symptoms include tenderness and pain when pressure is applied to the sides of your Achilles tendon. If the condition is left untreated, your Achilles tendon may begin to thicken and develop nodules.
If any of these symptoms sound familiar, you should stop exercising and make an appointment to see your GP. They will be able to assess your condition and advise you on the best course of treatment.
What are the treatments for Achilles tendonitis?
If you are suffering from Achilles tendonitis, it’s important to rest, ice and elevate your foot.

Before we can discuss what you should do if you have or suspect that you have a tendon rupture, we first need to discuss what a tendon is.
Tendons are tough connective tissue bands or cords that connect muscle to bone. They are responsible for transmitting the forces generated by muscles to the bones that they are connected to. They consist of various types of collagen organised into fascicles. Theses fascicles are then organised into bundles, which are then surrounded by a membrane called the epitenon. This unit is then described as the tendon.

The arch of the foot is a collection of bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles that are constructed to allow your foot to bear the weight of your body safely. These tissues and bones of your arch are in constant motion as you walk and run, absorbing impacts that might otherwise injure you. The arch of your foot has its limits, however, and arch pain can be a sign that you?ve passed those limits and injured yourself. Pay close attention to any pain you are feeling in your foot. What may seem at first to be simple soreness from being on your feet all day could be a sign of a more serious stress injury or repeated motion injury. Arch pain could also be a result of a fall or impact injury, so be sure to seek proper treatment.
The doctor will take a brief history to determine how the injury occurred. If necessary, a thorough physical exam may be conducted to evaluate for any other injuries. Taking your workout shoes to the exam may also provide valuable information to the medical practitioner. Both feet will be physically and visually examined by the medical practitioner.

When the calf muscles contract, they pull on the Achilles Tendon, causing your foot to point down and helping you rise on your toes. Achilles pain occurs just above the back of the heel and often sufferers also experience tightness in the calf muscles. The Achilles Tendon in this area may be noticeably thickened and tender to the touch. Pain is present with walking, especially when pushing off on the toes.
Persistent strain on the Achilles tendons causes irritation and micro damage. In severe cases this strain may even cause the tendon to rupture! Chronic overuse (particularly in runners) may contribute to changes in the Achilles tendon as well, leading to degeneration and thickening of the tendon. Tight calf muscles also contribute to Achilles Tendonitis Tendinopathy. As we age, our tendons can degenerate, leading to weakness in the fibres of the tendon.
However, one of the most common cause of this condition is incorrect foot posture. As the feet roll inwards excessively (pronation), the lower leg is forced to rotate internally, putting a shearing force on the calf muscles. The calf muscles are connected to the Achilles tendon and with the Achilles being the ‘weakest link in the chain’ the Achilles tendon is being over-stretched, resulting in irritation and micro damage.
Wearing orthotics helps prevent faulty biomechanics. By wearing correct orthotics, the strain on the Achilles will be greatly

The Achilles tendon is the large tendon located in the back of the leg that connects the calf muscle to the heel. Enormous load goes through this tendon as it gives us the ability to toe off during walking, running and jumping activities.
Achilles tendon pain (Tendinopathy) is most common among middle-aged people and athletes.
What are the signs and symptoms of Achilles Tendon Pain?
Initially pain may only be felt during exercise, as injury worsens pain may also be present during normal daily activities.
Foot posture - a rigid high arched foot has reduced ankle dorsiflexion which increases compression load at Achilles tendon.
Foot posture - a pronated foot type has a smaller volume of tendon which reduces the capacity to take load.
Poor muscle flexibility (eg tight calf muscles); decreased joint range of motion (stiff ankle joint) which increases compression load at Achilles tendon.
Reactive diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, or genetic makeup affecting the integrity of collagen fibres.
Treatment for chronic Achilles tendinopathy depends on the location of injury and whether it is in the reactive or degenerative stage of injury.

Abnormalities of the Achilles tendon include inflammation (Achilles tendinitis), degeneration, rupture, and becoming embedded with cholesterol deposits (xanthomas).
The achilles tendon, tendo calcaneus attaches distally to the calcaneual tuberosity, and arrises superiorly from the triceps surae complex of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.
The Achilles tendon connects muscle to bone, like other tendons, and is located at the back of the lower leg. The Achilles tendon connects the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to the calcaneal tuberosity on the calcaneus (heel bone). The tendon begins near the middle of the calf, and receives muscle fibers on its inner surface, particularly from the soleus muscle, almost to its lower end. Gradually thinning below, it inserts into the middle part of the back of the calcaneus bone. The tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end so that its narrowest part is about 4 cm (1.6 in) above its insertion.
The tendon is covered by the fascia and skin, and stands out prominently behind the bone; the gap is filled up with areolar and adipose tissue. A bursa lies between the tendon and the upper part of the calcaneus. It is about 15 centimetres (6 in) long.	Along the side of the muscle, and superficial to it, is the small saphenous vein.

This is one of the most common ankle tendon injuries. It occurs frequently in sports-related injuries with it being common in basketball. This type of injury is predominant amongst adult males between the ages of 30-50. Tears most often occur around two inches from where it connects to the heel bone. Blood flow is limited to this area and affects the area’s healing ability.
If an Achilles tendon tear occurs, there may be a popping sound that occurs when the foot is flexed backwards at the time of the injury. This will be accompanied by severe pain in the back of the ankle and up the lower legs. This pain will occur immediately upon injury. Swelling may also occur. Depending on the severity of the rupture, movement may be limited when trying to extend the foot downward.
These factors may increase the probability of tearing along with leading to a tear apart from injury.
Tearing can range from minor to severe, depending on how much tearing has taken place. In other words, the tear can either be partial or complete. Minor tears can occur over time, which may lead to more severe damage. An acute tear, a singular instance of injury, may also occur. The tear may be interstitial, which means that it is limited to the same fibers of tendon. The severity of the tear is determined by the limitation of movement when trying to flex the foot. A complete tear will be felt and will limit mobility.

Just to make sure you understand the difference we will briefly discuss each of the different forms of Achilles tendon problems that can afflict runners.
Achilles Tendinopathy is a useless, but official-medic-sounding term meaning something is wrong, diseased, or “pathologic” with the Achilles. But because it doesn’t tell you what is really wrong with the tendon, it does not help you at all determine what you should do to fix it.
The earliest form of Achilles tendon trouble is Achilles Paratendinitis. This means you have inflammation surrounding the tendon, but no inflammation within the actual tendon itself. In cases of Achilles paratedinitis, there is inflammatory fluid accumulating between the Achilles tendon and the paratenon or the thin outer layer surrounding the tendon.
Achilles tendinitis is inflammation within the tendon itself.
Achilles tendonosis is degeneration of the collagen that makes up the tendon. It is caused by chronic inflammation and irritation of the substance of the tendon. As it progresses, the fibers of the tendon start to become disorganized. They become weaker and more prone to microscopic tears. Over time, the tearing of the Achilles tendon can progress and become weaker. It then becomes prone to rupture or complete tearing. In some cases, the Achilles tendon may rip away from its attachment at the back of the heel bone.

Retrieved Text: Achilles tendonitis is when the achilles tendon becomes inflamed or irritated. This inflammation is often the result of a lot of stress on your calf muscles and achilles tendon from either a sudden increase in intensity or frequency of exercise. Chronic overuse can contribute to micro-tears in the achilles tendon, leading to wear and tear over time that weakens the tendon and thickening of the tendon from scar tissue.
When treated promptly, achilles tendonitis is often short-lived. Left untreated, Achilles tendonitis can cause persistent pain or cause your tendon to rupture. The healing process causes scar tissue to form. Because scar tissue is not as elastic as the tendon, the scar tissue doesn’t allow the tendon to stretch normally, which can lead to a rupture of the tendon.
Fortunately, rest and over-the-counter medications to reduce your pain and inflammation may be all the treatment you need for Achilles tendonitis. In some cases, physical therapy may be needed. If you ignore symptoms, the result can be a rupture or tear of the tendon and surgery may be needed.

Retrieved Text: Achilles tendon ruptures are very common sports injuries. Many years ago, these were treated without surgery, but muscular weakness and a high risk of re-rupture were common problems. Over the past 10-15 years, the majority of orthopedists have advocated repair. Repair clearly decreases the risk of re-rupture, but muscular weakness remains an issue, and there are risks of infection, wound healing complications, and nerve damage.
In the past few years, the controversy as to whether surgical or nonsurgical treatment is preferred has resurfaced. Some recent studies suggest that when the same accelerated rehab program is used, the outcomes for surgery or nonoperative treatment are much more similar than in the “old days”. We used to immobilize patients longer in a boot or cast, whether or not we did surgery. Accelerated rehab somewhat decreases the difference in outcomes, but there is still a somewhat higher risk of re-rupture and more muscular weakness without surgery.
This article found that nonsurgical treatment of achilles tendon ruptures results in significantly more chronic muscular atrophy than surgery. In addition, without surgery, the tendon heals nearly 2cm longer (stretched). I’ve always been a strong proponent of surgical repair for achilles tendon rupture. The study I’ve cited here is just one data point, but in combination with the well established body of research and my own clinical experience, it strongly reinforces my recommendation for surgical repair of these injuries for the vast majority of my patients.

Achilles tendonitis is typically caused by repeated motion and stress to your foot. It is common in sports like running and hiking. Changes in your footwear and sudden stress to your calf muscle can also result in Achilles tendonitis. As the largest tendon in your city, Achilles Tendonitis connects your calf muscles to your heel bone, which allows you walk, run, jump, etc.
Your tendons are bands of tissue that connect bone to muscle, and tendonitis occurs when the tendon becomes inflamed. Tendonitis can develop in any tendon in your foot.
The pain that you experience due to Achilles tendonitis is typically a result of microtears. You might notice mild or severe ankle pain, or heel pain after periods of prolonged inactivity. You can also experience swelling in the area of the Achilles tendon, pain when you stretch the tendon or stand on your toes, or pain when you use your calf muscle. It is common for the pain to worsen throughout the day.
Early treatment of Achilles tendonitis is important to prevent rupture of the tendon. The R.I.C.E. method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) can help to reduce swelling and pain. You may need to reduce your activity levels to allow the microtears to heal, which can take two

Something in my gut told me to get a pregnancy test, but I didn't think I could get pregnant since my OB/GYN gave me something that wound up messing up my menstrual cycles and stopping them completely. I still remember taking all eight pregnancy tests just because I was in that much shock.
I didn't tell the father yet because I wanted to be sure before telling him, so I made an appointment. Even though I already know I was pregnant, I needed the doctor's confirmation. After the appointment I got in the car and texted the father because I knew he was at work. He asked if I would have an abortion but didn't force the decision, surprisingly. When I told my mother, she was completely supportive—which made me happy because I knew I was gonna be a single mother since the father lived in Kansas and had gotten back with his ex-girlfriend. The day before my sonogram I asked the father if he wanted to see the picture afterwords, but all he said was, “I'm so stressed out from this; I don't know how you’re

This question exasperated me because I felt compelled to educate the interrogator, but also feared that my engaging in conversation would lead to additional, and more invasive, questions.
This question always followed question No. 3 and was always asked by total strangers. What did they really want to know? The manner in which my daughters were conceived? Or how they were delivered (vaginally vs. C-section)? The answer to either is, "None of your business."

Who would guess the national Irish-American drinking day would really mess with my ability to have a nice party to celebrate the day of my birth with friends.
In the beginning, after Nathan left, going out to the town’s most popular Irish pub for my birthday was amazing. I pretended everyone was there to celebrate me. To make it even better, I’m an auburn, green eyed, pale skin, Irish girl. It’s my birthday, and we’re celebrating my heritage? Ok!

That was a birthday social sacrifice I didn’t realize I was making. I now see the truth. I now feel the holiday birthday struggle.

Holding up is to keep something from getting away or falling, to keep in high regard, to endure. You’re holding up quite well under the circumstances, I like to hear, as opposed to why do you have to keep hanging on? Hanging on is to hold tightly, to grasp, perhaps in desperation. Hanging on is waiting, persisting with some effort despite difficulties or setbacks. It is clutching at something and letting it lead you who-knows-where, maybe even allowing it to drag you backwards or under.

This was enormously popular and I will swear that a whole generation of children grew up quite ignorant of the proper words.
JANE: Here the traditional “Happy Birthday” song took a blow some years ago. This is the story as I heard it.
A number of chain restaurants were making quite a big thing out of birthday celebrations which would often include a free slice of cake for the lucky guest. In order to get this, however, the guest had to submit to the indignity of a large chuck of the wait-staff gathering to sing “Happy Birthday to You,” loudly and, in the best Harry Potter tradition, off-key.
This was ruled as “for profit” and a lawsuit was brought by the owners of the song, insisting they were entitled to compensation. So the restaurants wrote their own, usually horrible, songs. The one I really hated began with “Happy! Happy!” followed by loud, synchronized clapping. Probably the only good thing about this was that since it was chanted, rather than sung, it wasn’t as likely to be off key.
Even this seems to have died out, so those of us who aren’t celebrating birthdays don’t need to suffer.

She stays for some time in each country, seeking for an opportunity to understand the communities’ lives, to feel their spirit and to acquire new monastic experience. Sister Margarete told us that among all the destinations they considered for her trip, St. Elisabeth Convent was the only monastery that her spiritual mother had pointed out as a “must see”!

Sister Margarete had turned 15 when her family’s pursuit of life in Jesus Christ began to encounter difficulties in their Protestant community. Fewer and fewer people really understood what was happening at the religious service: did it matter whether the congregation recited a creed together? Was the bread and wine at Holy Communion the Body and Blood of Christ? Did it matter whether members of the congregation had been baptized? Gradually, Sister Margarete’s family realized that no Protestant community they could find would have a unified understanding of these questions.

In her essay Ginny Weasley, Why? published on The Harry Potter Lexicon in October 2003, author Water Witch presented a surprisingly astute evaluation of the importance of Ginny Weasley—surprising because, although the article was written after the publication of Order of the Phoenix, it predated Half-Blood Prince. Even though Rowling finally defines Ginny’s personality in Order of the Phoenix, there are few indicators, though they do exist, that she will become Harry’s sweetheart. Water Witch claims JKR continually misdirects our attention from Ginny in the earlier novels while suggesting Ginny’s significance from her very first scene, claiming that Ginny running after the train (PS6) is a “pseudo lover’s scene” taking place as it does in a train station, a traditional trysting place and alluding to where JKR’s parents met.
Rowling has developed Ginny’s character slowly through the books, giving her a personality that makes her a fit match for Harry. Below I trace how JKR has accomplished this, and conclude with some possibilities for developments related to Ginny in Book Seven.
Ginevra is both a Weasley and a Gryffindor: courageous, talented and mischievous. In the first three novels Rowling throws us some red herrings which suggest Ginny is a shrinking violet, a lovesick teenager or an easily duped victim. However, if we remember that Rowling admires mystery writer Dorothy L.

Well sorry, Edward and the rest of the Cullen's aren't related to Count Dracula.
But it was annoying saying you can't like Harry Potter and Twilight..uh they are just books.
Its been going on for years. Oh Harry ended up with Ginny instead of someone else.
3.All the Cursed Child hate.
No fans. Its not the eighth Harry Potter book its what happened next.
Ok Ron's a comical character. Well it is a stage play and he was a comical character in the films.
4. Wait what why are we called No-Maj and I thought it was Salem Witches Institute.
No-Maj is American English. Notice in the fourth book if the American school was Salem Witches Institute then what happened to the students? We saw Beauxbatons Students when the Dark Mark was cast after the Quidditch World Cup.
Mainly Ginny because of the so called change because she was just a background character in earlier books. Oh and Dumbledore was planning on Harry's death and should've told him about the Horcruxes after the diary. Oh yeah frighten a 12 year old.
I don't really mind that Harry ended up with Ginny. It is Ron/Hermione, that I won't ever understand. JK Rowling came to admit that she made a mistake there, and Ron and Hermione would need marriage counseling.
Oh and Dumbledore was planning on Harry's death and should've told him about the Horcruxes after the diary. Oh yeah frighten

"Good haul mate?" Ron made his way over from his own bed.
"Let's get downstairs, I smell breakfast." Both boys made their way down to the breakfast table where George, Aubrey, Percy, Penelope, Mr. Weasley, Ginny and Luke were already seated. The table had had to be extended until it nearly touched the walls on both ends in order to accommodate everyone.

"She hasn't made it down yet. Bill and Fleur went for a walk through the village and I'm not sure where Charlie is." She chatted idly while scurrying back and forth putting food on plates. Harry sat quietly as the noise level grew, everyone chatting excitedly and swapping details about their gifts. It was enough of a gift to him to simply enjoy the company of everyone he loved most.

ARE HIDDEN CAMERAS LEGAL WHERE YOU LIVE?
The very first thing you want to figure out is whether hidden cameras are legal where you live. If they’re not, then you’re probably going to want to stay away from buying and installing one.
Home security camera legality isn’t as cut and dry a topic as you might expect. While it’s legal to install a hidden camera in your house in the United States, regardless of what particular state you live in, there are some areas that are off limits. You can’t film anyone in “private areas.” These include bathrooms and guest bedrooms.
You’re liable for breaking the law if you don’t notify your nanny of your nanny cam in these states. Perhaps more importantly, any audio evidence you record without someone’s consent will likely be inadmissible in court.
Now that we know the legality of home security cameras, it’s time to look at whether you should consider a hidden camera or an exposed

If you want the charm and atmosphere of the Caribbean with all the comforts and amenities of travelling in the United States, vacations to Puerto Rico are the easiest way to find the best of both worlds. The first stop is San Juan, an intriguing mix of old Spanish buildings and American Cadillacs all splashed in Caribbean colour. Step away from the capital and you can find an open air natural history museum on Isla Mona, see the magnificent mountain reserves at the Bosque Estatal de Carite, and find a coastline littered with great diving spots, water sports facilities, and endless beaches where you can work on your tan. But if you want a vacation that harks back to when life truly moved at a glacial pace, visit the island of Culebra, where luxury hotels, golf country clubs, and most things touristy fade into oblivion, leaving behind a truly Puerto Rican lifestyle where simplicity is the name of the game.
Too many options is rarely a bad thing but the fact that Puerto Rico has something for everyone, no matter what you're in the mood for, makes planning a vacation here a bit of a daunting task. All inclusive vacation deals may be the best way to save on your trip, but the question is, what will you include?

I had originally thought of going to Puerto Rico in March during my birthday month but after realizing I had leftover time from work that I had to use or lose, I made the most out of my time off.
Puerto Rico was a my top choice out of all of the other places I had considered because I wanted to travel to a plan that is very warm, relatively cheap, and a place where I would be fine to travel solo to. Puerto Rico basically fit this criteria, though if I go back, I would prefer to go with a friend!
What did not surprise me about Puerto Rico is that the people were in general, extremely warm (as warm as the climate!). For instance, my first day I got a little lost on my way back from the beach and this elderly woman pulled me close to her so that I could share her umbrella. I am not so sure if people where I am from would consider doing this with a stranger!
One downside to Puerto Rico is that if you are a woman walking alone outside -in the daylight or not-you can expect to be catcalled. I learned this within minutes of stepping outside my front door. Another downside is that walking outside at

Soda – In the nearly two weeks on the island, only two restaurants had fountain soda. Nearly all of the rest had only cans. So plan or order accordingly if you are a big soda drinker.
Rain – Rain in Puerto Rico is inevitable. Make sure that your itinerary has some “fluff” to accommodate rain days. We were extremely lucky, with only one full day of rain.
“Cheap” is Relative – You will read reviews of restaurants noting their cheap or affordable menu. Be aware that this is not quite what it is back at home. An affordable dinner is sub $25 in Puerto Rico. Plan on paying at least $15-20 per person, if you want full service, even in the Luquillo Kiosks.
You are not being pulled over – Apparently it is the law in Puerto Rico, that all in-service emergency vehicles must have their flashing lights on, while in motion. This is a little odd to get used to, especially when there are blue lights right behind you.
Pay-at-the-Pump – I failed to see a single gas station that accepted credit cards at the pump. So plan on having to go inside to pay for your gas. It may be wise to get gas in busier/touristy areas if you do not speak Spanish.

The main point that is really hard to ignore is that 54% of the electorate agreed that the island’s current commonwealth arrangement is no longer a viable option. Can we all agree to that or will that still get spun?
Pierluisi did suggest that question two was not a clear mandate for statehood. The results were still muddy, and as I have argued before, that muddiness had to do with the very poor strategic decision by Puerto Rico’s governor-elect Alejandro García Padilla (pro-commonwealth Democrat) telling voters to leave the second ballot blank. Blank was not an option in this plebiscite, so the results don’t count. People can spin it all they want, saying that the plebiscite was just a ploy by the pro-statehood party to portray a result that is not reflective of the majority of Puerto Ricans. But the fact remains: all this talk of statehood and all this national attention that Puerto Rico is getting about statehood would have gone away if García Padilla and other pro-commonwealth leaders had just told their supporters to choose options like independence or associated free state. They didn’t, and now the U.S. media is crafting a narrative that puts statehood at the front of the agenda.

The anti-democratic tendencies of the Senate are well known: Each citizen of a small state is considered more important than each citizen of a large state. It’s a deliberate feature of the Constitution, created to persuade smaller states to join the union. Over time, though, the racial edge to the Senate’s structure has become much sharper — for two big reasons.
More populous states, whose power is diminished by the Senate’s structure, tend to be more racially diverse. States with fewer people have a greater share of white residents. Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., have no senators and are both heavily nonwhite.
It’s time to fix this inequity and to make Washington and Puerto Rico the 51st and 52nd states, with full representation in the Senate and the House. A few years ago, this idea would have seemed radical (or at least it would have outside of Washington and Puerto Rico, where it’s long been popular.) But it is now starting to get more attention, and it deserves to. Those four million American citizens deserve to be treated as American citizens.
I know that some Republicans will claim that adding two states is just a ploy to help the Democratic Party. But if the people of Washington and Puerto Rico want to be represented by Democrats, they should have that right.

As our fellow Americans in the Carolinas face the devastation of Hurricane Florence, we are reminded that this week marks one year since Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, and when Irma and Maria devastated the Virgin Islands.
In Puerto Rico, Maria came ashore in my hometown, Yabucoa, as a Category 4 storm. Sustained winds, exceeding 150 miles per hour, ravaged bridges, roads and destroyed more than 87,000 homes – with another 385,000 being seriously damaged. Physical damages are expected to exceed $90 billion.
The entire territory – all 3.4 million American citizens – lost power. Thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of residents would not regain electricity for nine months – marking the longest blackout in American history.
It will probably remain forever unknown the exact number of Puerto Ricans who lost their lives from Maria. Earlier this month, the Government of Puerto Rico finally acknowledged that Maria killed nearly 3,000 Puerto Ricans – after months of insisting that the official death count was 64.
Sadly, many of these lives could have been saved if the Trump Administration had fully marshalled the resources of the federal government, but sadly, that never happened.
In fact, just last week, Donald Trump shamefully tweeted comments calling into question the death toll in Puerto Rico and belittling the suffering that occurred there.
That is unacceptable. When disaster strikes, the President has a solemn responsibility to be the President for all Americans – whether they live in Texas, Florida, or the territories

In September 2017, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, one of the strongest storms to directly strike the island in more than a century.
In the weeks following the storm, Enterprise employees acted quickly – coming together to ensure the business could get customers where they needed to go, even while their own lives were afflicted.
In this story, Eduardo A., HR Manager in Puerto Rico, provides a firsthand account of his experiences after the storm and the resilience and dedication of employees who went above and beyond.
On the morning of Sept. 18, the department heads in our administrative office met to discuss our readiness plan in preparation for Hurricane Maria. Having just endured Hurricane Irma, we felt confident in our plans; however, nothing could ever have prepared us for what was to come in the following days.
High winds and torrential rains began on Sept. 19 and by early morning the next day, Hurricane Maria made landfall. The Category 4 storm hit the island with sustained winds of 175 mph and three feet of rain and impacted literally everyone who lives here.
In only one day, everyone in Puerto Rico lost power, water and communications – pushing everyone into a state of shock and disbelief. What had once been a lush green island was now completely brown and buried in debris and water.
By the afternoon of Sept. 20, the winds slowed enough to start assessing the damage of homes.

Retrieved Text: SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Expensive jet fuel and a soft American economy are threatening to sink Caribbean tourism as airline ticket prices soar and flights are sharply reduced, choking the flow of the vacationers that many tiny islands depend upon.
Tourism is the economic cornerstone of the Caribbean, which drew more than 15 million visitors last year to colonial cities and carefree beaches.
"Billions of dollars of investment are being exposed and thousands of jobs are being exposed," said Allen Chastanet, chairman of the Caribbean Tourism Organization.
Airlines are cutting back across the world as passengers balk at paying fares that have risen along with fuel costs. The Caribbean is particularly vulnerable because one foundering airline, American, controls much of the market — carrying more than 60 percent of passengers traveling through Puerto Rico last year.
American now expects to cut daily flights out of Puerto Rico's capital from 93 to 51 in September. Some flights will be cut to Santo Domingo, Antigua, St. Maarten, Aruba and Samana in the Dominican Republic, spokeswoman Minnette Velez said.
Fewer flights to Puerto Rico also could also jeopardize the island's cruise ship industry, since it would be harder for passengers to reach the island to board. Ten cruise ships used Puerto Rico as their home port last year.
Rather than raise ticket prices so high that they're beyond the reach of most customers, American has decided to cut flights and reduce capacity, Velez said. "Traveling would be completely inaccessible if we increase fares as oil prices rise," she said.
Other carriers are making similar moves.

There is a debate raging in square dance groups on Facebook (and presumably elsewhere) these days about the square dance dress code. On one side, there are the people who think it is an infringement of personal freedom to be told to wear anything in particular (other than some sort of clothing), and on the other, there are people who feel that the traditional costumes are part of the activity and, therefore, dancers should wear them. There are also people in the middle, since some people like to have a dress code of some sort (e.g. “long sleeves for men, skirts for women” or “dress nicely” or “no shorts”) and some people like to have dress codes for certain events but not others.

The main exception to this rule is if you plan on being inside an air conditioned building that is NOT overly crowded. Another cosplayer I met who was cosplaying as Death the Kid from Soul Eater at that convention was mostly hanging out in a less crowded part of the convention and highly recommended against doing a photoshoot in the desert in the middle of summer in a Death the Kid cosplay.
Another recommendation I have is to avoid wearing shorts, thin clothing, and other summer weather clothing at conventions taking place during winter or fall. The original shirt I had for my cosplay costume for Liz Thompson from Soul Eater was made from and old pair of stretchy pajama pants. As ingenious as this shirt was, I was freezing cold outside. And it was worse when I wore the same shirt with shorts for my cosplay costume for Patty Thompson, Liz's twin sister from Soul Eater.

Throughout history, movie theaters have evolved to attract new movie-goers. In the 1910s through the 1940s, movie "palaces" were ornately decorated theaters designed to provide patrons with an atmosphere mimicking an outdoor courtyard, complete with facades, fauna, and projectors called Brenograph that projected clouds and stars onto the ceiling.
Even though more modern cinemas don't look anything like they did a century ago, theater owners still strive to give movie-goers a unique and immersive experience, whether it's with the snacks and food, 3D, or stadium seating. Dolby Laboratories is one company that is aiming to take theater audio and visuals to places it has never been before, and the team over at RocketJump Film School got to take a tour of Dolby Headquarters based in San Fransisco to learn more about its premium cinema concept, Dolby Cinema.
In a time when more and more people are choosing to watch movies at home on TVs, computers, and smartphones, it seems as though Dolby's battle is largely uphill. Theater attendance is down, box office sales are down, movie theater chain shares are down—how do you get people to drive to a theater and pay for movie tickets when they've already got popcorn, Netflix, and a 72-inch 4K TV at home?
Popular chains have already introduced better options to attract customers, including better food, alcoholic beverages, and leather recliners that can be reserved ahead of time. But perhaps one of the most effective, or at least spectacular

It may be the best movie I’ve seen in years, certainly one of them. I can’t think of anything more tense or gripping that’s for sure. My hand kept clenching the seat and I almost grabbed the hand of my friend sitting next to me. (It would be a perfect date movie for that reason).
The story is simple. Its 2 astronauts in space and a test missile gets launched by Russia and it ends up hitting debris that comes shooting out at the explorer shuttle of the Americans. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney must then figure out how to get home when literally lost in space.
That’s all I can say. Anything else would be a spoiler but there were many times I thought ‘no way. That isn’t going to happen’ and then it did. So, I never let my guard down for long. It was amazing. I felt adrenalin for about 2 hours after. Still feeling it a little now.
The special effects are astonishing. How did they do it? They say that they used no zero gravity like they did in Apollo 13. They used green screen and a series of small wires. It’s hard to believe it feels so real. That’s why you have to see it on the IMAX

Also, you can rest assured my friends, I do have confirmation that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire which stars Jennifer Lawrence is indeed showing in the Boeing IMAX Theater so here goes.
The last set of stats is pretty much what you will also find at the Southcenter Mall IMAX, Alderwood Mall IMAX, and any other "IMAX" theater that is in a mall location. If you live in one of those areas, save yourself some cash for popcorn or candy and see the movie on a non "IMAX" screen. You really won't miss anything.
It is also very important for you to know that key portions of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire have been shot with IMAX cameras. Josh Hutcherson, who reprises his role as Peeta Mellark in the sequel, revealed in an an interview with MTV that the arena sequences will all be shown in IMAX format and have been filmed using IMAX cameras.
"All the stuff in the arena is going to be IMAX," Hutcherson explained, "So when you go see it in IMAX, you'll see the regular movie when we're in the Districts and in the Capitol. When you see us go up in the pod in the games, it will open up into IMAX.

Some of these techniques and innovations have been successful in making a visit to the cinema even more enjoyable. But some attempts at creating a better experience hasn’t worked all that well. Right now two of the biggest enhancements are IMAX and 3D. Both will make a bigger dent in your wallet but both can be loads of fun when executed well. So for this week’s Throwdown you get to decide which offers you the better moviegoing experience. Is it IMAX or is it 3D. As always you vote, you decide, and the winner takes all.
Whether you like it or whether you don’t, you have to admit that 3D technology has come a long way. Years ago it found its way into the movie theaters with pretty mixed results. The technology has seen several incantations over the years but it seems to have finally figured things out. The first movie to open my eyes to the technology’s possibilities was James Cameron’s blockbuster “Avatar”. Narratively speaking I thought “Avatar” was an overrated mess, technically it was an amazing accomplishment. Since then many movies have tapped into (or should I say cashed into) the 3D craze. Unfortunately subpar results have outweighed good ones. Studios have taken to tacking on 3D in post production instead of shooting their films with 3D in mind. The results have been lackluster at best. On the flipside there have been some films that have

He came back and said there was a 3D lens leaning against the projector lens or something to that effect so he moved it and did something else too and said it should be fine now. So I went back and didn't noticed any change at all. Anyway so the movie wasn't as dark as I thought it would be so that's good. It wasn't as clear or as sharp as my TV and didn't see the same level of detail either. Most theaters I've been to are along these lines so I don't really have a clue as to what a theater is supposed to look like. I know home projectors might be better because you're in control where in a theater you're not. There just doesn't seem to be anyone overlooking theaters these days so they can get away with anything and the general public doesn't know any better...me included but then they probably don't care either.

PLFs have been around for years, with higher quality presentation and a larger screen giving theaters the opportunity to charge customers higher prices for tickets. In my experience, whether or not I buy a ticket for a PLF version of a movie usually depends on the combination of the theater chain (are its PLF theaters equipped with upgraded seats and a noticeably better sound system?) and the individual movie itself (is it really worth it to pay extra to see this movie in this format?).
Soon we may have to add THX Ultimate Cinema to the list of moviegoing options.

The world’s first exposure to it will be at the Regency Westwood Village Theater in Los Angeles and will launch in the spring/summer of 2019, but theater owners will be able to buy the system and set their own pricing for their individual markets.

Because I had an annual pass, I was late to cancelling than many of my friends, family members and moviegoers across the country. Many canceled in August after MoviePass changed the program from a movie a day to three a month.
An annual pass holders were still entitled to see one movie a day, but when I tried on countless occasions to see a movie and there were none available, I went for the refund.
MoviePass did something for me and many others. It renewed a love of the movies — at a steep discount.
But it was destined to fail.
“The (MoviePass) model was financially unsustainable,” said Jim Fosina, CEO of Fosina Marketing Group, based in Danbury, Connecticut.
Although MoviePass continues to deteriorate, two subscription models are succeeding: AMC Stubs A-List and Sinemia.

Hubble 3D and Born to Be Wild 3D are playing daily at the Great Clips Theater. Hubble 3D focuses on the depths of space by using the images captured by the Hubble Telescope.

Myself, I want to check out an HFR screening of this film, if only because I’ve heard such bad reactions from critics and the Twitterverse about it (they say the moving images are just too clear and too smooth, almost like watching video instead of film), I fear this may be the last chance to see it (or future movies!) in this format. Also, because reactions have been so split, I definitely want to check it out for myself to see how I feel about it before it potentially goes away.

I went to the IMAX version of Contagion at the downtown AMC theatre in Toronto. After two minutes in the theatre, I realized their main issue that needs fixing: IMAX comes in so many shapes and sizes and has a hard time explaining to consumers what they will get.
The most popular (and funny) recent description of IMAX confusion comes from NBC show Parks and Recreation‘s Aziz Ansari, who raged against IMAX a few months ago and demanded his $5 IMAX surcharge back, after he felt he didn’t really get an IMAX experience.
In brand terms, IMAX is struggling with its brand architecture.
IMAX thinks its positioning is “better picture, better sound, better screens” but people who have known the brand since the start think it’s “REALLY big screens with better pictures and sound”. IMAX marketing messages have not caught up with the business realities that have forced them to insert IMAX experience into regular theatres. To make matters worse, major improvements in picture, sound quality, 3D enhancements and tactile experiences in “normal” movies and theatres have made the IMAX “difference” negligible in those multiplex situations, leading to disappointment.
IMAX would benefit from renaming, or at least clarifying the difference between, the multiple types of IMAX theatre available. They try to explain on their website but it’s very confusing.

Now the House of Mouse and the big big screen company have renewed their deal to last through 2017, and the roster of films included in the deal shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Unsurprisingly, it includes Star Wars: Rogue One and Star Wars: Episode VIII, and Marvel's upcoming Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Thor: Ragnarok. But those aren't the only Disney films that will get IMAX releases over the next couple years. More below!
The deal also includes Pixar Anomation's sequels Finding Dory and also Toy Story 4. However, the latter will only have a limited IMAX release on June 16th 2017, and that may be because it's sandwiched by Fantastic Four arriving on June 9th and Wonder Woman on June 23rd, both releases which are ripe for IMAX. Other films in the deal include Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, The Jungle Book, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and The Finest Hours. There's likely more Disney films under this deal, but these are the big ones. There's plenty of IMAX fun to come!
Cool, but those fake IMAX screens ruin the brand.
I don't think so. An IMAX branding pretty much means one thing: "This is the biggest screen with the best sound system in this theater."

What's the difference between the RPX and Imax theatres at Regal? I have not been to a RPX yet. Kind of wondering if one would come to the Minnesota locations.
Can you have both Imax and RPX at one theatre?
Regal's RPX/AMC's ETX/ Cinemark's XD/etc etc are proprietary parallels to the digital IMAX experience. It enables the circuits to offer some sort of Premium format, with the accompanying surcharge, without having the pay for IMAX Licensing fees.

Throughout history, movie theaters have evolved to attract new movie-goers. In the 1910s through the 1940s, movie "palaces" were ornately decorated theaters designed to provide patrons with an atmosphere mimicking an outdoor courtyard, complete with facades, fauna, and projectors called Brenograph that projected clouds and stars onto the ceiling.
Even though more modern cinemas don't look anything like they did a century ago, theater owners still strive to give movie-goers a unique and immersive experience, whether it's with the snacks and food, 3D, or stadium seating. Dolby Laboratories is one company that is aiming to take theater audio and visuals to places it has never been before, and the team over at RocketJump Film School got to take a tour of Dolby Headquarters based in San Fransisco to learn more about its premium cinema concept, Dolby Cinema.
In a time when more and more people are choosing to watch movies at home on TVs, computers, and smartphones, it seems as though Dolby's battle is largely uphill. Theater attendance is down, box office sales are down, movie theater chain shares are down—how do you get people to drive to a theater and pay for movie tickets when they've already got popcorn, Netflix, and a 72-inch 4K TV at home?
Popular chains have already introduced better options to attract customers, including better food, alcoholic beverages, and leather recliners that can be reserved ahead of time. But perhaps one of the most effective, or at least spectacular

It may be the best movie I’ve seen in years, certainly one of them. I can’t think of anything more tense or gripping that’s for sure. My hand kept clenching the seat and I almost grabbed the hand of my friend sitting next to me. (It would be a perfect date movie for that reason).
The story is simple. Its 2 astronauts in space and a test missile gets launched by Russia and it ends up hitting debris that comes shooting out at the explorer shuttle of the Americans. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney must then figure out how to get home when literally lost in space.

The first movie to open my eyes to the technology’s possibilities was James Cameron’s blockbuster “Avatar”. Narratively speaking I thought “Avatar” was an overrated mess, technically it was an amazing accomplishment. Since then many movies have tapped into (or should I say cashed into) the 3D craze.

In my experience, whether or not I buy a ticket for a PLF version of a movie usually depends on the combination of the theater chain (are its PLF theaters equipped with upgraded seats and a noticeably better sound system?) and the individual movie itself (is it really worth it to pay extra to see this movie in this format?).

I went to the IMAX version of Contagion at the downtown AMC theatre in Toronto. After two minutes in the theatre, I realized their main issue that needs fixing: IMAX comes in so many shapes and sizes and has a hard time explaining to consumers what they will get.
The most popular (and funny) recent description of IMAX confusion comes from NBC show Parks and Recreation‘s Aziz Ansari, who raged against IMAX a few months ago and demanded his $5 IMAX surcharge back, after he felt he didn’t really get an IMAX experience.
In brand terms, IMAX is struggling with its brand architecture.
IMAX thinks its positioning is “better picture, better sound, better screens” but people who have known the brand since the start think it’s “REALLY big screens with better pictures and sound”. IMAX marketing messages have not caught up with the business realities that have forced them to insert IMAX experience into regular theatres. To make matters worse, major improvements in picture, sound quality, 3D enhancements and tactile experiences in “normal” movies and theatres have made the IMAX “difference” negligible in those multiplex situations, leading to disappointment.
IMAX would benefit from renaming, or at least clarifying the difference between, the multiple types of IMAX theatre available. They try to explain on their website but it’s very confusing.

Now the House of Mouse and the big big screen company have renewed their deal to last through 2017, and the roster of films included in the deal shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Unsurprisingly, it includes Star Wars: Rogue One and Star Wars: Episode VIII, and Marvel's upcoming Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Thor: Ragnarok. But those aren't the only Disney films that will get IMAX releases over the next couple years. More below!
The deal also includes Pixar Anomation's sequels Finding Dory and also Toy Story 4. However, the latter will only have a limited IMAX release on June 16th 2017, and that may be because it's sandwiched by Fantastic Four arriving on June 9th and Wonder Woman on June 23rd, both releases which are ripe for IMAX. Other films in the deal include Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, The Jungle Book, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and The Finest Hours. There's likely more Disney films under this deal, but these are the big ones. There's plenty of IMAX fun to come!

His first non-Howard Stern guest spot must have made an impression with someone because TMZ is reporting that Artie is currently in talks with the people responsible for “The Dan Patrick” show, to develop a radio program in a similar format. The show will reportedly be co-hosted by DiPaolo and simulcast on DirecTV and FSR.
In listening between the lines of the Fox Radio guest spot and recent Howard Stern Show comments, its sounds like Artie is ready to re-join the Stern Show, but is not welcome back. When asked about re-joining the show, Artie commented “I was on the greatest show of all time for about 9 years … and I put them in a very awkward situation to say the least, so, what am i gonna do?” That sounds like a closed door to me.
Stern often comments about how he could not take another incident like the one with Artie’s attempted suicide in December of 2010. Howard was deeply affected by Artie’s pain and says he will not put himself in that position to be hurt again.
I’m sure we will hear all about it on Monday when the Stern Show returns from a two-week 4th of July vacation… unless it’s a three-week 4th of July vacation.

This is a spooOOOooky adaptation of the Merry Widow, in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail book. I’ve basically updated the formula, swapped in Italicus and Chartreuse for Benedictine and absinthe and - most importantly - given it a cool colour effect and a vaguely undeady name.
Method: Shake the first three ingredients with ice, strain into the shot glass and float the cream on top.
Every year at around this time I try to create some kind of cocktail based on everyone's favourite autumn coffee drink: the Pumpkin Spiced Latte. This is 2018's version - a shot version of the drink, with extra cream on top.

Natasha Case knows that building a good ice cream sandwich is as much a science as it is an art.
In fact, her ice cream company Coolhaus—which she founded in 2009 with her now-wife, Freya Estreller—was born out of a career in architecture.
Today, Coolhaus has a booming retail business, as well as trucks and scoop shops in L.A. and Dallas, proffering towering "sammies" and peerless pint flavors like Buttered French Toast.
HANA ASBRINK: Please tell us a bit about yourself, and what you do.
NATASHA CASE: I’m an L.A. native, former architect turned "farchitect" (food and architecture). I play the saxophone and speak Italian. I love basketball, golf, and tennis. I’m the CEO and co-founder of Coolhaus ice cream, where I head up innovation, brand, creative, and marketing. I love what I do—truly, it’s a dream and I’m thankful every day. It’s just so damn fun. I have an amazing wife, Freya Estreller. We founded Coolhaus together. She's my biggest advocate and critic, and truly makes me my best self. She now runs ops at Tea Drops and is a fellow founder of Future Gin. We have a two year-old son, Remy, who is so full of life and is our inspiration to build our empires!

Being a total Harry Potter nerd, I had to immediately visit Freeze San Diego and get this stuff into my belly. Jake made me go to the DMV with him and I felt this was just the right treat to reward me for going to a place I don’t even like going to on my own. Ha.
Freeze San Diego makes their ice cream with nitrogen so it’s kind of like having fresh made to order ice cream since it’s made in small batches for you after you order it.
True to it’s name, this ice cream is PURE black (made with charcoal!) and full of magical flavors. It’s a bit like “butterscotch lite” since it’s a mix of butterscotch and vanilla. The gold flecks just make it looks magical and pretty while adding a little texture to the ice cream. I loved the striking black color which turns your tongue black. I liked the contrast of purple cone, too. Really delicious.
Since I liked the Black Magic ice cream so much, we went again and tried The Mermaid. This time I got the black waffle cone for the contrasting colors! The Mermaid is sea salt vanilla ice cream with pecan cookie crumbles mixed in (think Pecan Sandies). They add a bunch of pretty sprinkles

I was introduced to "The Hummer" by the mixologist himself at the Detroit Yacht Club. Back in the day (15 years ago) when my husband was working red-capet events for Audi he managed a regatta in Detroit. It was at that event that I met Jerome Adams, inventor of "The Hummer." The drink is famous at the club, so I had to try it. As I was pretty much going "ga ga" over the drink Jerome asked me if I wanted to learn how to make it. Wow. Amazing. What a gift. I will now pass along the recipe exactly as I received it from Jerome.
1. Fill 1/2 of the blender with ice cubes.
2. Fill the top half with vanilla ice cream.
2. With equal amount of Kahula and rum in each hand pour until the liquid reaches 1/2 way up the blender.
3. Blend until you have the most delicious adult milk shake you've ever tasted. (Adjust with ice cubes, ice cream as necessary to get ideal consistency).
Found you at Tastequery. I love this recipe. I am willing to dive into the RUm and the ice cream.
Ha ha! Especially on a hot day!

Tonight I was trying a new recipe out of Stephen Raichland's Beer-Can Chicken: and 74 Other Recipes for Off-Beat Cooking on the Grill, Rosemary Tuna Fish Sticks. The marinating had to be done for 20-30 minutes, but I tend to forget there's a great deal of work that needs to be done to prepare said marinade. Plus, I served it with my signature grilled veggies, which takes a good chunk of time on its own. So here I am at a quarter to seven, sweating the fact that the zucchini still needs to be cut up, and the grill isn't even on yet.
While I still think threading the tuna with rosemary twigs is a bit of overkill, I was thrilled with the outcome. The medium-rare chunks of tuna were meaty, popping with the zest of lemon juice and minced garlic. I made up Raichland's Mediterranean salsa for a topping (tomatoes, black olives, capers, garlic, red wine vinegar and olive oil); what a great match with the tuna.
I'll tell you what else was a great match: Santa Duc Côtes du Rhone. For an Old World wine, this was all fruit forward, displaying ripe raspberry and cherry on the nose. Smooth, soft feel, fairly light bodied with low tannins, and an acidity that was strong enough to come up against the lemon juice and garlic

Among them, my adventures with language learning and ice cream consumption bring the biggest smile to my face.
Over the months, I have only posted a limited number of photos of the kids for privacy reasons, but I did ask their mother if I could share the following snapshots I took after our visit to El Bertin. They are just too cute not to share! Both boys asked for the "Schoggi" flavor, which they ended up sharing with me - desperate to stop the melting ice cream from dripping onto their hands, arms, and clothing.
I tried the Black Chocolate with Chili, which was more like delicious black chocolate with a tingling sensation. I've also tried zimt (cinnamon), yogurt, and coconut - all yummy!
We had dinner in Schaffhausen at the Thai restaurant Lemongrass on Saturday evening. Just about every person walking past was eating ice cream and I was wondering what's going on! Now I see the ice cream shop you're talking about is just down the road from the restaurant we were at so they must have all been coming from there! Next time maybe we'll go just for ice cream - no space after dinner!!

Being a total Harry Potter nerd, I had to immediately visit Freeze San Diego and get this stuff into my belly. Jake made me go to the DMV with him and I felt this was just the right treat to reward me for going to a place I don’t even like going to on my own. Ha.
Freeze San Diego makes their ice cream with nitrogen so it’s kind of like having fresh made to order ice cream since it’s made in small batches for you after you order it.
True to it’s name, this ice cream is PURE black (made with charcoal!) and full of magical flavors. It’s a bit like “butterscotch lite” since it’s a mix of butterscotch and vanilla. The gold flecks just make it looks magical and pretty while adding a little texture to the ice cream. I loved the striking black color which turns your tongue black. I liked the contrast of purple cone, too. Really delicious.
Since I liked the Black Magic ice cream so much, we went again and tried The Mermaid. This time I got the black waffle cone for the contrasting colors! The Mermaid is sea salt vanilla ice cream with pecan cookie crumbles mixed in (think Pecan Sandies). They add a bunch of pretty sprinkles

I was introduced to "The Hummer" by the mixologist himself at the Detroit Yacht Club. Back in the day (15 years ago) when my husband was working red-capet events for Audi he managed a regatta in Detroit. It was at that event that I met Jerome Adams, inventor of "The Hummer." The drink is famous at the club, so I had to try it. As I was pretty much going "ga ga" over the drink Jerome asked me if I wanted to learn how to make it. Wow. Amazing. What a gift. I will now pass along the recipe exactly as I received it from Jerome.
1. Fill 1/2 of the blender with ice cubes.
2. Fill the top half with vanilla ice cream.
2. With equal amount of Kahula and rum in each hand pour until the liquid reaches 1/2 way up the blender.
3. Blend until you have the most delicious adult milk shake you've ever tasted. (Adjust with ice cubes, ice cream as necessary to get ideal consistency).
Found you at Tastequery. I love this recipe. I am willing to dive into the RUm and the ice cream.

Tonight I was trying a new recipe out of Stephen Raichland's Beer-Can Chicken: and 74 Other Recipes for Off-Beat Cooking on the Grill, Rosemary Tuna Fish Sticks. The marinating had to be done for 20-30 minutes, but I tend to forget there's a great deal of work that needs to be done to prepare said marinade. Plus, I served it with my signature grilled veggies, which takes a good chunk of time on its own. So here I am at a quarter to seven, sweating the fact that the zucchini still needs to be cut up, and the grill isn't even on yet.
While I still think threading the tuna with rosemary twigs is a bit of overkill, I was thrilled with the outcome. The medium-rare chunks of tuna were meaty, popping with the zest of lemon juice and minced garlic. I made up Raichland's Mediterranean salsa for a topping (tomatoes, black olives, capers, garlic, red wine vinegar and olive oil); what a great match with the tuna.
I'll tell you what else was a great match: Santa Duc Côtes du Rhone. For an Old World wine, this was all fruit forward, displaying ripe raspberry and cherry on the nose. Smooth, soft feel, fairly light bodied with low tannins, and an acidity that was strong enough to come up against the lemon juice and garlic

I have taught the history of church music to every freshman student at the singing school for the past 35 years. Every summer I introduce song writers, tell their stories, and sing a line or two of some of their most famous songs. In the past all our students were able to sing the first line or two of the most famous songs from memory without having to look up the songs in a hymnal. That is our heritage.
In the summer of 2005 things suddenly change. When it came time to sing a line or two of the most famous hymns and gospel songs I witnessed a change in audience participation. The adult members of the class sang along with me, but the teens did not. It soon became painfully obvious that today’s teens can no longer sing a line or two of class hymns from memory.
Why? You can see a clear reason for this new situation by considering the following series of events.
We have a long-standing custom at the singing school of hosting a daily singing at 10 AM where the teachers lead the songs. Songs for that singing are carefully selected to encourage our students to sing all styles of songs. We blend classic hymns with gospel songs, southern gospel, spirituals, and songs of praise and worship. We then allow the students to vote for their favorite songs from that list of selections.

As I drove home I realized the phenomenal rarity of the whole thing. The final words of the hymn said, “And through eternity I’ll sing on.” The hymn writer expressed a desire that few people consider: that the tempo of heaven is the tempo of a new song (Rev. 14:3). The idea of perpetual, eternal singing sounds dreadful unless you congregate in the melody of Jesus often and frequently.
I have often said that the congregation is God’s choir. Jesus is our song leader. We often don’t see Jesus leading us, which is why many dread the singing of church life and if they do show appreciation it’s generally manifested in a passive sort of way–they sing, we listen.
But Jesus wants more. He wants to lead us into green pastures, which is less a metaphor for gentle feelings and more a description of peace after warfare. So, sing! Sing children! Sing old man and maiden! Sing for joy for your God sings over you (Zep. 3:17). Sing to war! Jesus has and will lead us to victory.

When do you need a right to sing a song?
I was talking with a group a while ago who decided at the last minute to set up at a pow wow. They had a pretty good time. While they were there, the Head Dancer (who was a Gourd Dancer) asked if they "had the right" to sing Gourd Dance songs and if so, could they sing a few as an exhibition for him. The Lead singer explained that of the singers that were present, they could only sing about a set of Gourd Dance songs.
I was asked if singers really needed permission to sing Gourd Dance songs when you are called upon to do so. They were taken by surprise because they never expected anyone in that area to make such a request. My reply to these guys was similar to what I got from others when I passed it along. As I was taught, as a singer you have a responsibility to the people. And if you know the songs, i.e. taught by some reliable resources, then you should oblige. When it comes to the Gourd Dance alone...this is a totally different story.
Upon discussing this further with other singers, we agreed that the family songs (especially the word songs) may require a bit of "extra attention".

I loved to listen to songs. In the good old days, we used to keep song books with lyrics of songs. Before karaoke, many of us would know how to strum some basic chords and sing along. We would figure out the chords and just strum the rhythm by just following our ear and feel. Now with karaoke, we have the background music, the lyrics appearing at the right time to prompt you and you can even adjust the key to suit your voice. Those days we have to arrange the chords to a different key. With this technology, singing is much easier now. But it is not as easy as it appears to be. Some people sound better than others and it still needs some effort to sound good. In this post I will share my tips on karaoke singing.

In my talk, Why do scientists sing about science, I focused on science songs that aren’t meant to educate. Songs like the PCR song, Bad Project and Get Data are aimed at people who are already very familiar with life in a research lab. They’re meant to entertain other scientists.

Many people have heard this myth in the past; this can cause them to want to shun canned or frozen varieties. Avoiding these options, especially during the winter months in the Midwest, can significantly limit options and variety. Exploring the similarities and differences between fresh, canned, and frozen fruits and vegetables can help when deciding which choice is best for you and your family.
According to the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Services MyPlate nutrition guide, fruits and vegetables should make up the largest proportion of foods consumed each day. By filling half your plate with fruits and veggies at mealtimes, you maximize nutrient and fiber intake while filling up on these good-for-you foods. A recent study analyzed the nutritional value of all forms of fruits and vegetables and found that fresh, canned and frozen produce all contribute to a healthy diet. With this being said, all forms have positives and negatives associated with them.
If you can’t find your favorite veggies in low- or no-sodium varieties, try draining and rinsing the product before cooking it in fresh water. This can reduce the sodium by 9 percent to 23 percent, depending on the vegetable. When purchasing canned fruits, look for options that are packed in water or juice. Try to avoid fruits packed in syrup. Be sure to consume canned produce immediately after opening

We are very fortunate to have a food system that makes canned and frozen produce options available year round, at a very affordable price, and has the ability to last a really long time. But best of all, studies have proven that these options are healthy!
Canned, frozen or fresh vegetable; which is best?
According to Alice H. Lichtenstein, DSc, director of Tufts’ HNRCA Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory, "For the most part, frozen vegetables and fruits are processed close to the point of harvesting, and ... have the same level of nutrients as fresh." Lichtenstein also states that because of this short time between harvesting and processing, some frozen vegetables may even be more nutritious than fresh: "Fresh fruits and vegetables — more so than frozen or canned — can vary in quality, depending on when they were picked relative to when they are available to purchase and the conditions under which they were transported and stored, the length of storage time and the conditions under which they are displayed."
This means that nutrients in fresh produce diminish during lengthy transportation times and when improperly stored and handled. So in some instances, frozen/canned produce can be healthier options over fresh since their nutrients have been protected

The term "fresh" produce is misleading, because it has lost a lot of its nutritional value by the time it shows up at your local supermarket.
Canned food is America’s most available and affordable source of excellent nutrition.
According to nutrition expert Dr. Victor Zeines (DDS and MS in Nutrition), from the documentary Food Matters, "...your food really, in the best of times, is traveling between 1,500 and 2,000 miles before you get it and is at least a week old... How much nutrition value are you getting from food that is at least five days old? ...If you are lucky you are getting maybe 40% of what you need."
Canned fruits and vegetables are picked at the peak of ripeness and canned within hours. This not only delivers long-term food quality and shelf-life, but locks in food nutrients at their peak without the need to add preservatives. Steel cans are a total barrier against light, which deteriorates food from its natural vitality. In fact, many canned products actually contribute more health-promoting nutrients than cooked fresh or frozen foods.
The best way to preserve all of the nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables is through the iron-clad technology of metal containers.

And the most common misconception between shoppers when choosing food is that frozen is a long-shelf life item that has very little nutrient content and poor taste – however, this is not always the case. When fruits and vegetables are harvested, they begin to ripen as soon as they are picked. So by the time that they are delivered and appear on supermarket shelves they’ve already been ripening and degrading – not to mention the time they spend sitting on those shelves. So the produce that you purchase may already be a few days old from the time it was harvested.
This degradation is due to a process called ‘respiration’, which is when plants absorb oxygen that breaks down carbohydrates in the plant and converts it into carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. This reaction is fine when the fruit or vegetable is still intact on its tree and is actively receiving nutrients to replace these carbohydrates. Once picked, the produce has no way of replacing its stores, and as a result its reserves become depleted and the produce eventually loses moisture, is reduced in quality and is susceptible to bacterial spoilage.
Frozen produce’s degradation is largely reduced by its processing and storage at low temperatures that prevent the growth of microorganisms,

Preserved produce is often cheaper and more readily available. Sure, it’s great to stick with what’s in season. But I dare you to make it through winter without a single recipe that calls for tomatoes. (Stews and pasta sauce, anyone?) The canned stuff only costs a buck or two, and it’s guaranteed tastier than the wan and mealy fresh version.
It can be nutritionally equivalent, or even superior, to fresh. Some of the vitamins and minerals in produce start to degrade soon after harvesting, explains Diane Barrett, a food scientist at the University of California-Davis who has studied the nutritional differences between processed and fresh. By the time a stalk of broccoli makes it from the farm to the supermarket to your refrigerator, it has already lost some of its nutritional value. “Fruits and vegetables are frozen within hours of harvest, so that actually allows you to retain those nutrients,” says Barrett, who receives industry funding.
Cooking also degrades certain nutrients, vitamin C in particular. Since vegetables such as broccoli and spinach are blanched (boiled briefly) before freezing, you might think they’d end up with less vitamin C than their fresh counterparts. Barrett’s analyses, however, have found little difference—likely because the fresh produce already has lost some vitamin C sitting on the shelf. Plus, blanching may

The 5+ a-day campaign, which was started in 1994, recommends a minimum of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day. However, studies have shown that there are issues relating to the socio-economic groups intake of fruit and vegetables. Less wealthy people have tended to consume less fruit and vegetables.
“In fact, research has indicated that fresh, frozen and canned [fruit and vegetables] are nutritionally comparable.” Fresh items are perceived as the healthiest options, however, frozen and even some canned products may contain similar or sometimes higher levels of nutrients, depending on the vegetable or fruit.

1.) Myth: Fresh fruits and vegetables are healthier than frozen or canned.
Fact: Frozen fruits and vegetables are as nutritious as fresh, but canned options are normally not. While canned fruits and vegetables tend to lose a lot of nutrients during the preservation process, some canned foods, such as spinach and pumpkin, actually have higher amounts of vitamin A than their fresher counterparts. With that being said, canned fruits and vegetables have a tendency to be higher in sodium and added sugar. Regarding frozen fruits and vegetables, they may be even more healthful than some of the fresh produce sold in supermarkets. Fruits and vegetables chosen for freezing tend to be processed at their peak ripeness. The “flash-freezing” process locks the vegetables in a relatively nutrient-rich state, where-as some fresh produce may spend days or even weeks being transported from the farm or orchard to the supermarket.
Tips: When fruits and vegetables are in season, buy them fresh and ripe, but when they not in season, buy them frozen. Choose packages marked with a USDA “U.S. Fancy” shield, which designates produce of the best size, shape and color. You still may want to eat frozen fruits and vegetables soon after purchase as over many months, nutrients in the frozen state do degrade eventually.

Canning technology has made huge improvements over the last 10 years. Packaged vegetables now give fresh food a run for its money, especially when it comes to price, prep time, and food waste. Canned and frozen vegetables are usually harvested at peak flavor and nutrition, whereas fresh produce is typically picked pre-maturely and travels 5-10 days before we consume it.
Some vegetables are actually better canned than frozen or fresh. Canned tomatoes, for example, are preserved using heat which releases lycopene—a carotenoid that has been linked to prostate and breast cancer prevention (Eating Well).
Why Does Takeout Kit Use Freeze-Dried Vegetables?
Freeze-dried vegetables are simply frozen vegetables with water extracted during the freeze drying process. This prevents food from spoiling, while still maintaining most of its flavor, color, texture, and nutritional value. When you cook your Takeout Kit, you will rehydrate the vegetables to make them whole again. This results in vegetables that are more convenient for cooking without sacrificing valuable nutrition. Most researchers agree that the amount of nutrients lost from freeze-drying is miniscule (Columbia University).
How Does Takeout Kit Choose Between Canned or Freeze Dried Vegetables?
We are extremely picky about our ingredients and prefer organic products whenever possible.
Taste and consistency are large factors. For example, in our Thai Crab Curry kit we tested 5 brands of organic canned green beans and were dissatisfied with the canned taste. When we swapped in freeze dried green beans it was obvious that green beans taste better outside of a can.
Mushrooms are the complete opposite.

This can reduce the sodium by 9 percent to 23 percent, depending on the vegetable. When purchasing canned fruits, look for options that are packed in water or juice. Try to avoid fruits packed in syrup. Be sure to consume canned produce immediately after opening for maximum flavor and nutritional value. Never store leftover fruits or veggies in the cans they were packed in.
Produce begins to lose nutrients and quality as soon as it’s picked and can lose between 10 percent to 50 percent of less stable nutrients during the shipping and holding process.
​For both canned and frozen vegetables and fruits, keep in mind that they are picked at their peak of ripeness. This is often not the case for produce that is intended to be consumed in its fresh form.

Autumn is a time to shift from the seed fruit that we eat in the summer to all the nutrition-rich goodies, like the grapes and persimmons we get in the fall. These fresh foods are not only tasty, but can help you feel better, get healthier and may protect against heart disease and stroke.
Fall brings its own color wheel of seasonal fruits and vegetables. Deep colors like oranges, reds, and purples are especially prominent in the cooler months. However, it’s important to strive for variety with your fall favorites. Don’t just have a green salad; add all different colors into the salad. More colors usually means there is good nutritional value in your meal.
Fruits and vegetables with color contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and phytochemicals that have different disease-fighting elements. These compounds may be important in reducing the risk of many conditions, including cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association recommends at least 4-5 servings per day of fruits and vegetables based on a 2000-calorie diet as part of a healthy lifestyle that can lower your risk for these diseases.

A new study published in the Journal of Nutrition and Food Sciences, May 2012, found that not only are most canned foods less expensive than their fresh, frozen and dried counterparts, but many also offer a more convenient way to get much-needed nutrients. For example, when purchase price, waste and preparation time are considered, canned tomatoes cost 60 percent less than fresh tomatoes to get the same amount of fiber.
The study, commissioned by the Canned Food Alliance (CFA), looked at the total cost of commonly used canned food and compared it to fresh, frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, beans and tuna. The research factored in not only actual grocery dollars spent, but also the value of the time required to prepare the food (cleaning, chopping, cooking, etc.) and the cost of the waste (pits, stems, cobs, seeds, etc.). Building on that information, the study authors analyzed the cost-per-nutrient of several key nutrients including protein, fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium and folate.
Canned foods contain the same important nutrients as fresh, frozen and dried varieties do,” says lead study author Dr. Cathy Kapica, adjunct professor of nutrition at Tufts University and science advisor to the CFA.

Are Dried or Canned Beans Healthier?
All beans are packed full of fiber, protein, nutrients and antioxidants.
That’s true of fresh beans, dried beans, frozen beans and canned beans.
So… Yes, canned beans are as nutritious as dried beans!
The thing to watch for in almost all canned goods, including beans, is added salt. Salt is a preservative and is added during the canning process in order to increase shelf life and make canned goods last for very long times. So, when buying canned beans (and other canned vegetables and soups) try reaching for the reduced salt or low sodium varieties.
Canned beans are a timesaver over dried beans, especially if you are not a planner and don’t think ahead. Canned beans can be eaten right out of the can. Whereas dried beans must be soaked, typically overnight, in advance of being ready to cook. Only then are they ready to boil or simmer until soft.
Many beans are also offered frozen, which are also just as nutritious but do need to be thawed before use, making them also take slightly longer to get on the table. Also, frozen beans will not last as long as canned or dried beans because moisture will eventually cause freezer burn on

Here are some of the processing options available regarding root crops.
Frozen asparagus: Asparagus spears are frozen whole by rapid freezing techniques to ensure maximum preservation of colour and texture. A blanching treatment is required prior to freezing. The frozen product is ready for use in soups and baked products.
Pickled asparagus is preserved by the addition of salt and acid. Asparagus are usually pickled as whole spears, alone or with the addition of other minor ingredients. Spices can also be used. The spices are usually in concentrated extract form and may include ginger, pimento, black pepper, chillies, cloves and coriander. Pickled asparagus may be pasteurised to further extend the storage life of the product.

Even our Formula 7 principle of “get 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day” does this. However, there’s a catch here: they’re not exactly equal, and it’s important to know why.
While fruits and veggies are both wonderful for our diets, they do different things in the body. Veggies definitely take the cake when it comes to nutrition and health… and that’s why you want to eat them both but focus on more veggies than fruits.
These micronutrients are important for healthy function of the nervous system, muscles, bones, eyes, immune system, and more. And since people tend to eat the same foods again and again (in fact, we recommend it), it’s better to keep that veggie intake high so you get that full spectrum of nutrients.
Plus, some of the nutrients that we closely associate with certain fruits can be found in higher amounts in vegetables. Vitamin C is a good example of this. Most people associate oranges with vitamin C, and they’re right—but you might not know broccoli has a little more vitamin C than oranges, and all bell peppers have way more!
Basically, veggies help you get more bang for your buck in the nutrient per calorie department, which is super for your overall health!

One of the biggest concerns when it comes to frozen vegetables is the nutritional content. Sure, we love the convenience of pre-washed, pre-cut vegetables but are we still getting the same nutrient-rich food if it was previously frozen?
According to registered dietitian Andrea Morganstein, you’re better off buying your veggies frozen. “Don’t feel guilty that you are not buying fresh as frozen fruits and vegetables are picked and frozen at their nutritional peak. By the time fresh produce actually gets to your table, nutrients are lost due to the transit time.” This means the longer that celery has been sitting on the shelf, exposed to light and air, the less nutritious it is.
Frozen food companies flash freeze to preserve quality and flavor. And it seems freezing can preserve their nutrients too. After picking the veggies at the peak of their ripeness, flash freezing locks the food in a nutrient-rich state.
Fresh produce is usually picked before it is ripe and then shipped to the supermarkets. And, unfortunately, this prevents the veggies from fully developing their nutrient content.
Also, if the produce isn’t in season, there’s a high chance transporting it took longer than usual. Long shipping times expose produce to mold and fungi as well as degrade the nutrients and minerals.
Their final recommendation? Just don’t store frozen produce for longer than 6 months as nutrients begin to break down significantly around this time.
So when your produce travels from the farm to your fork, it’s okay if it hits the freezer in between.

Contrary to some opinions, canned foods can present a viable alternative to fresh and frozen foods regarding nutrient content. Nutrient levels in foods can vary quite dramatically; factors such as source, processing and storage methods contribute to these variations. Whilst fresh food is widely considered to be the most nutritious, this is not always the case. From the point of harvest to consumption; degradation, spoilage and nutrient losses in fresh foods can be significant, due to factors such as air, light, heat and moisture. Animal produce such as meat is susceptible to spoilage, also vegetables and fruit begin to lose their cellular life and deteriorate, leading to reduced quality. Therefore, storage and processing methods ultimately influence the resulting nutrient content in the foods that we and our pets consume.
As you can see, how fresh foods are utilised, whilst retaining maximum nutrient content can prove difficult. Freezing is the most commonly employed processing method to preserve foods, yes even freezing is technically a processing method and carries variable but minimal nutrient loss. Processing methods are widely talked about when discussing depleted nutrient content in the foods we feed our pets; with fresh, raw feeding considered by many to be the ideal.

Frozen vegetables are also a good stand by to have and are just as good as fresh.
When shopping, avoid vegetables preserved in brine (contains added salt) or butter sauce and, where available, choose foods labelled ‘no added salt’, ‘low salt’ or ‘reduced salt’ varieties.

Close to the end of the ceremony the priest will then pass back the gold coins and the box they came in to the groom. At this point the groom pours the gold coins into his brides hands and places the box on top. This represents the grooms trust in his brides ability to take care of the finances and their family.

May was to be reserved for the veneration of the Virgin Mary, and August was thought to invite bad luck and sickness.
Sunday marriages (with the exception of the months mentioned above) are believed to be luckiest. In the Veneto region of Italy, the groom walks to the bride's house and, together, he walks with the bride and the whole wedding party to church. On the way, town residents would watch the group walk by and present the bride with many challenges. For example, they put a broom on the ground and if she bride noticed it and picked it up to put it away she was considered a good housekeeper. Then, she might come across a crying child, the couple is supposed to quiet him and make him smile; this would mean that they will be good parents. Coming across a beggar, means giving generously and is equaled to having a good heart.
The bride arrives to the wedding mass last. In the meantime, the groom waits in front of the church as his best men tease him about the bride, "Did you tell her that you're getting married today?" and "I don't think she'll come"! Her lateness, depending on the

It is possible to purchase the most beautiful invitations and all the extras without breaking the bank. It should be fun to find the right wedding invitations and should not be one of the stressful aspects of wedding planning. When the budget is an issue, the bride and groom should consider purchasing their wedding invitations through an online retailer. This can save time and money that can be put towards other parts of wedding planning. The most important consideration for the bride and groom is incorporating their wedding theme and tone into the wedding invitations.
Often, the bride and groom are inviting distant relatives and even their parent’s friends. This means that there may be no other contact with the guests besides the wedding invitations. That makes it imperative that the invitations convey the overall tone of the wedding whether it is formal or casual or has a special theme involved. This will ensure that all of the guests are properly prepared and dressed for the occasion. This means choosing wedding invitations that showcase this atmosphere without worrying about the cost.
Along with the wedding invitations, the couple is likely going to include a reply card. The reply card is just as important as the invitation itself. The bride and groom need to include a reply card that includes a line for the guests’ names, whether they will be attending the wedding, how many people will be attending, and their

This one really depends on how you handle alcohol, what kind of wedding it is and who’s wedding it is – but generally, make sure you don’t get drunk. Sure, it’s okay to get a little tipsy – but you don’t want to be that messy drunk ruining everyone’s night with your drunken behaviour – or ruining your professional image if it’s the wedding where your co-workers are also attending.

Signature cocktails have become a standard part of most wedding receptions. They are often very pretty drinks, created to match the wedding colors or themes. That’s all well and good, but what grooms like is to add their own twist to the wedding refreshments. Enter the martini bar, the brandy station, or the micro-brew bar. Personalized mugs would be great groomsmen gifts to tie in with this wedding addition. If the groom is a fitness fanatic, his take on the refreshment station could be a juice bar serving up fresh squeezed fruit juices with shots of wheat grass and protein powder. As long as it suits the groom’s tastes, it will be a great fit for the wedding.
The groom’s cake is a long-standing Southern tradition that has spread like wildfire to the rest of the country. It is often designed by the bride as a surprise for her fiance, although there is no reason that the groom could not have some input into his cake. Traditionally the groom’s cake is chocolate, and the outside is sculpted and frosted to look like his favorite dog, car, or hobby. Sports, food, professions, and fraternities are other popular themes for groom’s cakes.
Not every groom is into dancing, and some guys have their own ideas about what makes for great entertainment at a wedding reception.

Introduce yourself to the guests and tell them your relationship to the bride.
Offer a short memory or two of the bride in her youth.
Mention both the bride and the groom in the toast. While most of the toast is directed towards the bride, you should remember to offer congratulations to both of them.
Write how you speak. This is not the time to be following proper essay or report writing guidelines. You want the words to sound natural when you say them aloud.
Even though you want to write your full toast out, do not bring the entire copy to the wedding reception. Instead, write down a few key points that will help you remember each topic.
Take a few sips of water before standing to speak. You do not want to have cottonmouth or a cough while talking.
Smile while you are giving the toast. The wedding is a happy occasion.
Look at the guests, but remember to glance at the bride, too. Look at the bride and groom if addressing them personally.

There are so many cute ideas out there and I have found a few more that I couldn’t wait to share with you. A simple idea is to send a card. You can make it fun by giving them a Mad Libs or a crossword puzzle to fill in!
A great DIY idea is to take a ring box and put the scrabble letter “B” inside with the word bridesmaid behind it. Too cute!
Another fun idea is to have a towel with the phrase “Will you be my…” hanging on a “bridesmaid” hanger. Not only is this a cute idea but they can also use the hanger on the day of the wedding for their bridesmaid dresses!
A handkerchief or a bag filled with a piece of jewelry with the words “Will you be my bridesmaid?” are also great ways to ask your girls.

The bride and the groom kneel down and pray, asking their ancestors’ permission to be married and their blessing on their household-to-be. However, if a diamond engagement ring is the course you’ve decided to take (whether your the one giving or receiving) then there’s nonetheless one thing that I can’t seem to make sense of.
Typically, these positions are filled by shut mates of the bride and groom; being requested to serve in these capacities is seen as an ideal honour. The bridegroom’s household, having paid money for chest and cash for door, causes the bride to get into the automotive.
Marriage ceremony Night – at the wedding evening a number of games are played, speeches are held (the first normally from the father of the bride), typically a wedding newspaper is handed out. As part of this as well, the couple will drink sake, a traditional rice wine.
In some cases, the marriage ring seems to be “incomplete”; it is only when the 2 halves, engagement and wedding, are assembled that the ring seems entire. Another ceremony named Berbedak follows Menghantar, right here the shut members of both the households would bless the prospective bride and the groom.
Right now, broom-leaping is most frequently present in African-American weddings, the tradition rooted within the days of slavery when marriage between enslaved women and men wasn’t legally sanctioned. Rings with a larger diamond set in the middle and smaller diamonds on the aspect fit under this class.

- <b>What hobbies and interests do they have?</b> Choose gifts that will enhance the enjoyment of their interests. For example, some couples love bowling together. Search for a gift that's related to this sport such as matching personalized bowling hats.
- <b>What type of food do they both love?</b> If they love Italian food, then a gift certificate to a romantic Italian restaurant would be appropriate. Another idea is to put together or purchase an Italian food gift basket for a romantic picnic. If they're the type of couple that loves barbecued foods, a gift basket full of barbecue sauces, recipes and spices would be a welcomed wedding present.

The first wedding bells ring when a friend of yours (maybe a former classmate, cousin, or one of your parents’ friends’ kids) meets a special person who wants to share a common future together. Your friend invites you to their wedding party, and you immediately have a million questions. What to wear? What to give as a wedding present? What words of wisdom to say if you have no experience of family life? You go to the party, wipe tears of happiness from your eyes, throw some rice over the smiling couple, and enjoy every bit of the day.

Your university friends, your younger cousins, cousins of your boyfriend or girlfriend, colleagues… You need to attend every wedding, as it’s a national tradition, and not going when invited is rude. After experiencing a number of weddings, you know every scenario and the novelty begins to wear off.

Using mobile phones, the wedding entourage and guests can now become photographers, videographers, and commentators in their own right. And it’s more likely that other people who were not present during the wedding itself will view the ceremony through the guests’ lens, rather than through official channels. This gives us all the more reason to rein in the runaway posts during the big day.
Here are some ground rules for guests’ tech usage on the wedding day itself.
1. Ask the bride and groom if it’s ok to take photos during the wedding.
This seems to be an afterthought for most people, since they’re thinking they’re using their own camera phones. But whose wedding is it anyway? It’s likely that the bride and groom would prefer that the professional photographers they hired do their work properly, unhampered by guests who are blocking the photographers’ view.
For some bride and groom, it’s okay for guests to take photos during the wedding reception only, but not the wedding ceremony. Some would want that only official photographers take photos during the ceremony and reception. It would be best to ask permission first from the bride and groom.
Okay, so many guests would take photos of the wedding anyway. Make sure not to block the view of the official photographers, or even the view of the other wedding guests.

Couples either tend to work together in order to plan their special day or sometimes the bride can be so organised that their Groom simply needs to turn up to various appointments such as cake tasting or visiting wedding venues.
Did know that traditionally, the Groom is responsible for a number of tasks during the wedding planning stage and even paying for some of the wedding details!
Traditionally a Groom is expected to organise and pay for the wedding transportation. This includes how the Bride will arrive at the wedding along with her wedding party, getting the Groomsmen to the venue beforehand and even the possibility of transporting wedding guests between multiple venues, such as the Church and reception venue.
Choosing and purchasing the wedding rings is another important task on a Groom’s to do list. This is, however becoming more redundant as savvy Brides want to get involved with choosing their own wedding ring. If you are set on doing things traditionally, it might be worth discussing what your bride wants, taking her to the jewellers and getting your fingers sized together to prevent any disasters when exchanging rings at your wedding ceremony. Some couples also opt to buy each other their wedding rings which can make a lovely gesture.
One of the main tasks a Groom has when planning a wedding is to choose what he and his best man/groomsmen will wear. It is important to discuss wedding colour

Some might consider these trivial matters but if you're one of the poor souls dreading the moment you're handed the microphone in front of a room full of expectant faces then fear no more. Here's a complete breakdown of the correct form and order of speakers and also which wedding toasts each speaker gives.
And if you're not a natural public speaker then check out our tips on how to deliver your wedding speech.
Wedding toasts are actually the final part of a wedding speech when the speaker will ask everyone to drink to the health of a certain person or people who are important on the big day for various reasons.
Thanks - Everyone for attending and the groom's parents for their help in organising the wedding.
Toast - "To absent friends."
Extras - As the first speaker the bride’s father, who traditionally is considered the host of the wedding, will welcome all the guests. Welcome the groom to his family and speak about the bride.
Thanks - The wedding party; bridesmaids groomsmen, ushers, pageboys, best man, mothers of the bride and groom.
Toast - "To the bridesmaids."
Extras - During the thank you’s the groom will present gifts to each member for the bridal party on behalf of himself and his new bride. It is also modern tradition

In fact, destination weddings are increasingly becoming popular these days where the couple chooses to wed in a different country. If you have been invited to attend a wedding that will be held in a location far away from where you live, it should be clear what the costs would be and who pays for what.
For instance, some couples may intend to shoulder all the expenses that their guests will incur, including plane tickets and hotel accommodation just to have them there. However, this may not always be the case. Budget could be an issue and guests might need to pay for their own travel expenses should they want to attend the wedding.
Respond to RSVP– The letters RSVP are often printed on wedding invitations. These letters are an acronym for the French expression “répondez s’il vous plaît” which simply means “please, respond”. Below the letters RSVP, there should be a telephone number, a mobile number, or an e-mail address where you can get in touch with the organizer of the event. Clearly, the soon-to-be wedded couple is expecting your personal response whether you will attend or will not be able to attend their wedding.
Therefore, it’s very important to send word whether you will be present or not on the wedding day. Why is it necessary to send notice immediately? They need to know the exact number of guests expected to be there so that the necessary arrangements can be made. So

Wedding leis are special leis that symbolize the love that the couple has for each other, the love of everyone who is there to witness the event and the spirit of aloha that presides over the ceremony.
The wedding lei of the groom is often made of maile leaves. While the maile lei is most common for the groom, there are also ti-leaf wedding leis that are made in the maile lei style for grooms. Sometimes, these leaves will be interwoven with flowers such as the tuberose, a small white, fragrant blossom. The bride often wears a lei of Hawaiian wedding flowers such as tuberose, white ginger or orchids. Sometimes, a Hawaiian wedding lei is made up of two or three types of flowers all woven together in several strands to create a lush floral look.
Often, the bride also wears a floral headpiece. These may be made from local greenery and haku flowers to create a fragrant lei. Some couples will present their mothers with lei as well to show their love and respect for them. When the wedding ceremony is small, everyone may get a lei to show their support and love for the couple.
A common practice is for there to be special wedding leis for key members of the bride and groom’s families. Exchanging leis with everyone in the family welcomes them and makes them feel like an integral part of

Now I’m writing this post for three reasons.
One, to help out a very good friend of mine who recently asked for some advice about this.
Two, for anyone else who is looking for clear-cut plain English instructions on doing this without losing their marbles.
Before I start, here’s a quick rant about what AMP actually is, and why it’s important for bloggers and especially owners of news blogs to have this set up properly.
AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, and it’s a concept that Google has been pushing out for some time now in their continued efforts to make mobile friendly search top priority.
To make it very simple for anyone to understand AMP, it was designed to make web pages load almost instantly when searched for and viewed on mobile devices.
What visitors will actually see is a completely deconstructed version of a web page, without styling or much in the way of design.
This is, of course, to allow for fast loading, where just the content and featured image is visible.
If you run a news blog, or if you have a blog full stop, it’s imperative that you have AMP set up correctly, especially if you want to play by Google’s rules in the future and ensure your content has priority in mobile search.

However, due to the way in which this update was administered, such a log-out was not possible. The desktop session just hanged, when an attempt was made to log it out.

Now I’m writing this post for three reasons.
One, to help out a very good friend of mine who recently asked for some advice about this.
Two, for anyone else who is looking for clear-cut plain English instructions on doing this without losing their marbles.
Before I start, here’s a quick rant about what AMP actually is, and why it’s important for bloggers and especially owners of news blogs to have this set up properly.
AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, and it’s a concept that Google has been pushing out for some time now in their continued efforts to make mobile friendly search top priority.
To make it very simple for anyone to understand AMP, it was designed to make web pages load almost instantly when searched for and viewed on mobile devices.
What visitors will actually see is a completely deconstructed version of a web page, without styling or much in the way of design.
This is, of course, to allow for fast loading, where just the content and featured image is visible.
If you run a news blog, or if you have a blog full stop, it’s imperative that you have AMP set up correctly, especially if you want to play by Google’s rules in the future and ensure your content has priority in mobile search.
Now from what I’ve read elsewhere

My intention for this online space is for it to be a place where musings on the art of living come into existence, gathering ideas and resources that help to create a super healthy and satisfying life. My interests in mindfulness, personal growth, yoga, dance, kids, healthy food, teaching, and dreaming big, will certainly shine through. Beautiful photos, powerful quotes, awesome videos, and funny jokes will also make an appearance … whatever I can find to inspire and motivate myself and then be able to serve others.

This causes concern for users because the phone number that are associated with snapchat, usually are associated with other social media like facebook and twitter. To prevent abuse of our phone number, we can change the phone number on snapchat.
To change the phone number on snapchat for iPhone users, you need to activate SMS. Go to Settings -> Messages -> Send as SMS -> swap to ON.
Once you login on your Snapchat account, tap on the gear icon or settings on the top right corner. On the ‘My Account’ section, tap on “Mobile Number”. Follow the instruction to insert your phone number. Once you finished, tap on verify and you will see a pop-up, Select whether Send via SMS or call to give you verification code.
Enter the verification code that you recieve, and then tap on “Continue” to finish.
Every time you lost or change your phone number and then you try to log in to your Snapchat account with different phone number, Snapchat will ask you to verify your phone number, if the old phone number is lost, you can change it by doing this.

Further, there is a subsystem of KDE, which is known as its ‘PIM’ system, which stands for “Personal Information Management”. The KDE PIM system relies on a user-space server, called “Akonadi”.
Just today, the package manager pushed through an Update to the KDE-PIM system, including a major reworking of Akonadi.
This number of updated packages, will often require a general reboot of the system. But because this update only affected the Desktop Session, it should have been possible only to do a log-out, and then to log back in. No part of the Apache Web-server depends on KDE, so that the Apache server should have been able to keep running, and to keep serving out my Web-site.
However, due to the way in which this update was administered, such a log-out was not possible. The desktop session just hanged, when an attempt was made to log it out. A complete reboot was nevertheless required. Therefore, even though all the new components seem installed correctly, this update was botched.
As a result, my Site and my Blog were inaccessible from approximately 20h05 until 20h20.
Simultaneously, my Linux laptop named ‘Klystron’ received a Kernel-Update to version 4.4.0-46, which apparently succeeded.

I have four cats. Three are male and one is a female. Two males are fixed and one male and the female are not. They have grown up together.
For a short period the two males were separated from the unfixed male and female. I have brought them back together. It's been a month now and they all are peeing right outside the litter box and they occasionally poop outside the litter box.
I clean the cat box regularly and I’ve sprayed vinegar and other agents to delete the odor but no matter what I do, they continue to pee right outside the cat box. Does any one know why?
They have previously never done this. The female is the mother to the unfixed male and the female and one of the fixed males are siblings.
My thoughts: I'm sorry to hear your cats are having troubles. I'm assuming all cats have been health checked. If one or more cats is sick and triggered the domino effect, you'll need to address the health issue.
That said, cats are very territorial, and they need to work out the hierarchy. Sometimes when cats are separated for a time, it's necessary to do a "reset." Keep them in separate areas of the house and then reintroduce them slowly.
If these were my cats, I'd try splitting them up into two groups for a time, and following this cat-to-cat introduction process.

This is where your cat will use the box for pooping, but when it comes to peeing, they have decided that a nice corner, or a plastic bag left out on the floor, or a potted plant are better than that nice clean box of sand you put out for them. If your cat has been neutered or spayed, and he or she is still peeing on the floor and around the house, then this is the page for you! First, it is important to understand why your cat is peeing. It is usually not anything you are doing, it is related to his instincts and also his experience as a kitten.
First and foremost, anytime your cat exhibits different behavior than normal, it is always wise to see a vet to find out if there is a physiological reason why. One of the biggest reasons why cats start to pee around the house is urinary tract infections (UTI). Symptoms of a UTI are bloody or pinkish urine, squatting around the house with very little coming out, frequent peeing, and peeing in places besides the cat box. Your cat can have a UTI but not exhibit these symptoms, so it is best to take him in to rule out any health problems. If your cat is squatting to pee frequently and nothing is coming out at all, you need

Well, these could be medical or behavioral issues. Like you said, something is going on and if your vet says she's fine I would seek a second opinion.
If the peeing outside the box has started recently, something has changed. Either you changed litter, the litter isn't clean enough, you moved the litter box, or she has had some negative experience with the box (I once had a cat who heard a loud thunderclap while he was in the box, and he peed outside the box for weeks!) If it is not behavioral, it could be medical. Have a urinalysis done. Your cat may need to be on a special diet for urinary tract issues. Only a veterinary urinalysis can tell you for sure. The pulling out of fur - if it occurs around the cat's rear, it may be the cat is in pain from a urinary blockage. Or it could be a food allergy. Make sure your cat's food has no corn, wheat or rice in it. All can cause skin irritation. Try a food like Wellness or something grain free. But don't change food until you consult your vet about the urinary blockage. Sometimes vets don't catch it the first time around.

The first thing you should do straight away if your Cat has all of a sudden stopped using the litter box is to pay a visit to the Vets. You want to make sure your Cat is medically okay and healthy.
Cats may suffer from UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) which could be the reason why your Cat is peeing everywhere.
What are the causes that stress your Cat out?
Cats are very routine animals and they love routine so as soon as there is a change in their routine this can cause them stress.
Changes in their environment can cause them stress such as new furniture or you have redecorated your house.
You need to show your Cat more love and affection by taking time out and just sitting with him and stroking him.
If you have introduced a new routine such as feeding him a different time then it’s best you stick to his schedule.
Of course this all takes patience, time and understanding but if you keep at it you will have a happy Cat and a house that does not smell like Cat urine!

One of my cats experienced inappropriate litter box issues while my husband and I rented a three-story townhouse in Maryland. The litter boxes were in the “perfect” location, an unused room on the bottom floor. Well, perfect for us, not for her. Clio left us messages that she’d rather not go all the way downstairs to use the litter box. After ruling out any medical issues, we put a litter box in our walk-in closet upstairs — problem solved!
It is an unfortunate fact that failure to use the litter box, or “inappropriate urination” trouble, is one of the most common reasons a cat is taken to an animal shelter.
So what’s the first thing to do if your cat is peeing outside the box? Take your cat to the veterinarian for a checkup to ensure there is nothing medically wrong.
Then, if your cat gets a clean bill of health, scratch your head and think about what might have changed in your life, home, family, or routine. Cats like routine, and inappropriate litter box habits often show they are not adjusting to change.

Teaching your cat how to modify or change its behavior can help to ensure that you have a healthy and happy relationship with your pet. Here are some basic cat training tips to help you get started.
Usually, it isn’t too hard to train your cat how to use the litter box. By nature, cats tend to be clean and are naturally inclined to bury their own waste.
Set a clean, uncovered litter box within a confined area inside your home like a closed room and then place your cat in the litter box. If your cat ends up going outside of the litter box, put the waste inside of it. Usually, within a couple of days of being placed in the litter box, your cat will start using the box on a regular basis.
If your cat is still not using the litter box, make sure it is clean and try a different type of litter. If this doesn’t work, we recommend Cat Spraying No More – how to stop your cat peeing outside the litter box for good.
Here are some tips to help modify your cat’s behaviour if it isn’t doing something you don’t like. The first thing you need to do is try to understand why your cat is behaving the way it is. For example, if your cat is clawing at the furniture, keep in mind it that is a survival instinct.

This isn’t always limited to peeing, as some may do so while they poop as well. While it may not seem like a big issue when it’s done in the yard, walking and peeing at the same time can become a seriously messy problem for those with an indoor dog litter box.
First you need to consider why a dog does this. Often, the movement of walking helps them to completely empty their bladder or improve bowel movement. In some medical cases, this can be a symptom of incontinence, particularly common in senior or sick dogs. When sickness or old age is the cause, this can be a very different situation and should be addressed properly.
The first thing you need to look into is how much space your dog needs. Often, a dog will only take two to three steps before their bladder is empty. Depending on their size and leg length, you will want to find a litter box that can accommodate enough movement to avoid any accidents outside of the potty area. It is best to allow at least six to ten inches surplus in length and width to allow for movement, especially any circling and sniffing that need to be done.
As a precaution, you need to consider the placement of your dog’s litter box. The best locations are areas that are tiled, such as a bathroom, where cleaning up any mess will be

If your cat has blood in her urine it’s time to make an appointment with the veterinarian. The causes for a cat peeing blood run the gamut. A cat peeing blood could be something mild and passing or it might be caused by something life-threatening. Let’s find out what blood in cat pee looks like, its major causes, and what you can do to prevent, cure or manage the condition causing this alarming symptom!
First, what’s normal when it comes to cat pee?

The average, healthy, indoor cat will urinate twice a day. His urine will range in color from pale yellow to a deep golden color. It’s somewhat smelly. If he is intact it may be more pungent, but if he’s neutered, it should be an acidic scent that is not overwhelming. Scooping the box in the morning and in the evening is an effective way to monitor his health.
What’s not normal when it comes to cat pee?
Causes for concern in your cat’s health often crop up in the litter box first. Again, knowing what’s a baseline “normal” for your cat is crucial to early detection of medical issues.

Life would be so much easier if we could just ask our pets what's on their minds, instead of making educated guesses. Maybe you have a diva on your hands; your cat simply wants to be the next big reality star on Animal Planet's "My Cat From Hell" show.
If your cat has suddenly stopped using the litter box, have her checked out by the vet. If your kitty has developed a urinary tract problem such as kidney or bladder stones, or an infection, she may be in pain. Since the pain worsens when she strains to urinate, she learns to associate the pain with the litter box. If you have a tomcat, the chances of a urethral blockage are higher than if you had a female since the males are more prone to blockages. Your kitty may be peeing in a very obvious place, such as your bed, because she wants to be sure you see it and understand she's got a problem. It's her way of saying "a little help here, please."
If the problem cannot be blamed on an infection or blockage, it could be an emotional problem. Though some may say it's anthropomorphism to ascribe human emotions to animals, it's only possible to explain what's going on in your pussycat's head by using words to describe emotions such as fear or anger. It's not a leap to look at a cat who is standing on his toes with his hair sticking out and understand he's upset.

I recommend that you take him in to see your veterinarian. Increased aggression and urinating outside the litter box can be signs of an underlying medical issue. These can include a urinary tract infection, injury, arthritis, pain, or they can be a behavioral issue.
Your veterinarian can examine him for any underlying medical issues. If there is a medical issue then usually treating the issue will resolve the aggression and urinating issue. If it is a behavioral issue then he may need a treatment plan that includes behavioral modification. Your veterinarian can recommend the treatment that will be best for him.

As more and more cats live exclusively indoors (where they’re safest) more and more are also using the litter box. One of the best things about a litter box is that it allows you to be more aware of your cat’s urine habits. You may notice, for example, that you’re cleaning the box more often.
If there is more urine in the litter box, it can sometimes be a bit difficult to tell if a cat is peeing larger volumes or just more often; however, it’s important to differentiate increased frequency from increased volume, since they indicate completely different potential problems and point to different locations in the urinary system. There are conditions that cause increased frequency of small amounts of urine, conditions that result in large volumes of urine and conditions that cause increased attempts to urinate. You may need to keep a close eye on your cat to know for sure.
It will also be important to know what is normal for your cat so that changes will be noticeable. One study, reported by DVM 360, indicated that cats produced an average of 28 ml/kg of urine every 24 hours. That equals about one half cup of urine a day for the average 10 pound cat. In general, what goes in must come out. Although minute water losses include tear flow, saliva flow and fluids contained in stools, the majority of water leaves the body of animals as urine.

Why is your cat not using the litterbox?
Your cat’s unpredictable bathroom behavior does make sense … to your cat.

Some cat owners experience no litter box problems … but add another cat or person into the household, a move or any change in routine and your cat’s bathroom manners may falter.
Sometimes they seem to falter for no reason at all.
One problem occurs when cats just miss the litter box.
Either they are pooping just over the edge of the box, or squatting right next to the box and urinating.
Perhaps your cat is not going anywhere near the litter box.
He or she may have found an alternate location to do his business, which suits your cat just fine, or it could be urinating all over the house.
With litter box problems, sometimes the problem is not so much the cat as it is the box. If your cat dislikes the litter box (or the litter), for whatever reason, your cat won’t use it.

However, I know people who use a mechanical litter sorting machine, and say it works just fine.
I bring this up because your Friday Art Cat is having some issues. She raises her behind to urinate just over the edge of the box, and there has been some inappropriate marking on a mat in the human bathroom.
“You should have a covered box,” you say. Nope. No good. The enclosed structure encourages litter box stalking ,and subsequent peeing outside of the box because we’re too afraid to go in for fear of attack.
“You should have one more box than you have cats,” you say. Check. I have the correct count. I know every time I clean them. That’s not the issue.
“Maybe there’s a physical reason your cat is having difficulties.” Possible. The Art Cat takes a joint supplement with her food for hip arthritis. Therefore, it may be uncomfortable for her to take the proper stance. It doesn’t help that she also has a cantankerous nature which she unfairly hurls at her fellow felines, adding to everyone’s elimination tensions.

A couple said their cat was just starting to go outside the box. After a physical exam came back normal, I asked the couple a bunch of questions.
As it turns out, they kept the litter box in the basement and when I asked about any sudden noises such as a furnace or sump pump starting up, a light bulb went on.
They lived in a condo and often, when a new neighbor's washing machine went into the spin cycle, it would "dance" around the floor making a racket that could be heard in their own basement.
Perhaps on one or more occasions, the cat was scared away from the litter box.
I suggested that, because of that experience, the cat probably considered using the litter box to be a scary thing. So they moved the litter box upstairs and the problem ended.

Because of the many options available to them, most of our furry friends will have no problem finding a more preferable location to do their business if something isn’t quite right about their litter box. This ‘new and improved’ location is commonly a bed, a couch, or a carpet – and this is the point where a ‘normal’ feline behaviour can often be interpreted as ‘abnormal’ and often intolerable for many owners. Unfortunately, many medical problems can cause increased urination, impaired ability to urinate, pain on urination, etc. and these problems can manifest in the exact same way. Therefore it is imperative that we don’t assume it’s a matter of preference until the vet has ruled out all potential underlying medical conditions first.

There’s no doubt about it – cats are finicky creatures. They like things a certain way, and that includes the area where they do their business. I spoke with Liz Bales, feline veterinarian known as “the Catvocate” about this and she offered the following four “pro tips” cat parents need to do to keep their cats using their litter box.
1. Keep a clean litter box.
A cat’s litter box should be scooped out at least daily, and possibly more often for multi-cat families. In addition to daily cleaning, changing the litter at least once a month and washing the litter box itself will help to keep it smelling fresh and encourage your cat to use it faithfully. Note, when doing your monthly box wash out, don’t use citrus-scented cleaners or your cat may be repelled by the smell and boycott the box!
2. Find a litter they like and stick to it.
As I’ve shared with you before, World’s Best Cat Litter is the only thing we use at my house. Dr. Bales and I agree that among the many benefits of this natural and light-weight litter, it’s long lasting so one bag will last one cat for 30 days!

​The good news is that taking care of your plumbing is not difficult. Here’s how you can do that.
The first thing that needs to be done is moderate what gets thrown into your plumbing system. The septic tank cannot dispose of all wastes. Food matter, tissue papers, tampons, diapers and hair should not be thrown into the plumbing system. Not only do they have the potential to clog your plumbing system, but they also prevent your septic tank from breaking down waste.
Ensure that your drains have a mesh to prevent hair from going through. Keep a dustbin in your bathroom so that trash can be emptied in it.
It is of uttermost importance that you do not pour an excess of cleaner liquids down your plumbing system. Cleaner liquids are corrosive in nature and likely to wear your pipes after an overuse. Additionally, cleaner liquids will kill the good amount of bacteria and enzymes that are in your septic tank. Bacteria and enzymes are critical to process the wastes in your septic tank.

Here’s a checklist of what should happen during the septic tank pumping at your Prince William VA home.
Note the liquid level of the tank in relation to the tank’s outlet pipe. If the liquid level is above or below your outlet pipe, you have a problem. A liquid level is below the outlet pipe means there is probably a leak in your tank. A liquid level above the outlet pipe may indicate a problem with the pipe to the drainfield or the drainfield itself.
Pump the tank from the manhole, because pumping from inspection ports may damage tees and baffles. However, if pumping must occur from inspection ports, be sure to pump from both ports in order to pump all areas of the tank.
Watch for backflow from the tank outlet pipe. Significant backflow indicates a drainfield system backup. A small amount of backflow can indicate a sag in the pipe to the drainfield.
Pump the tank thoroughly; use a septage spoon and backflush to loosen the sludge in the corners of the tank.
Don’t “seed” the tank by leaving septage in it.
Don’t scrub or power wash the tank’s walls.

A basic septic tank system is made up of the septic tank itself, the drain field and the soil. Having said this, a more sophisticated tank, which can be constructed of plastic, fibreglass or concrete, can also feature a pump chamber and an overflow tank. If you are installing a septic tank and are looking at your options, you need to know what these features are.
Before we jump into explaining pump chambers and over flow tanks, let us first give you an understanding of what a septic tank does. In simple terms, wastewater enters the septic tank through the pipelines leading from your home. Once in the tank, the system begins to separate the waste by sinking the solids to the bottom forming the sludge layer and the lighter particles of waste rising to the top forming a level of scum.
This is the point at which the pump chamber comes into play. A pump chamber is installed after the septic tank and contains an effluent pump, control floats and a high water alarm. The main purpose of the pump chamber is to disperse the effluent when your site has a high water level or if the gradients for drainage are unfavourable.

If neglected entirely, they can be very difficult to ignore once something does go wrong. Domestic treatment plants and septic tanks of all kinds need regular maintenance.
Before you can maintain your septic system, you'll need to know how it works! Here are the fundamentals for the most common types of systems, and some of the issues which can arise.
If a building has a gravity septic system to treat waste water, then all the main drainage pipes in it are connected to one main exit pipe. This exit pipe feeds waste water to the septic tank, usually located underground and not far from the building. Anything put down the drain goes to the septic tank.
Here, the waste water separates in to solid and liquid. Solids fall to the bottom of the tank to form the sludge layer, effluent sits in the middle, and any liquids lighter than water (such as oils) sit at the top forming the scum layer.
An outlet pipe makes sure that only the effluent flows out of the tank and into the soil in the drainage field. Typically, the outlet is connected to a distribution box, which ensures that the effluent is equally dispersed into the pipes in the drainage field. Finally, holes in the drainage field pipes allow the safe effluent to flow into the soil. These pipes are surrounded by a layer of

You can prevent frozen pipes within the home, by ensuring the temperature does not fall below freezing. Another important step is insulating pipes that are exposed to cold temperatures. The pipes will be able to freeze if the temperature surrounding the pipes drops below freezing.

Septic tanks are usually located about 7 ft from the house wall where the largest vent pipe on the roof of the house is. There is usually a cap on the ground next to the wall (which may or may not be buried in some cases), this cap is an opening where your septic company technician can run a drain opener through the pipes to clear any pipeline clogs (it is not a place to pump out a septic tank). The access to pump out a tank is on top of the tank and is usually sealed to be water tight.
The drainfield is usually near the tank, and in some instances it may be in a different area or elevated on the property (a “mound system”) where a pump in another separate tank pumps the water “up” to a higher elevation. Tthese “mounds” are required where regulations and specifications by the state health department apply.

Septic systems are designed to provide long-term, effective treatment of household waste when operated and maintained properly. However, most systems that fail prematurely are due to improper maintenance. Less serious problems are usually with plumbing (such as pipe blockages from tree roots growing into the pipe).

What are the advantages of new septic systems over the older septic systems?
There are a number of advantages to newer septic systems. One obvious advantage of a new system, properly installed and maintained, is peace of mind. Some older systems still in use are no longer permitted under current Health Department regulations. If in doubt contact your local county health department. Another major advantage of newer systems is the use of PVC lines and other modern plumbing techniques which greatly reduce the risk of system backups if the system is properly maintained. Installation of new systems generally means easier access for pump outs with lids initially placed at or above ground level. This eliminates the need to dig up the lawn. New systems have secondary treatment systems to further treat the water before it gets discharged. Older systems were frequently routed directly from the tank into a tile which discharged into a stream, ditch or creek. That practice is no longer allowed under Health Department regulations since it is detrimental to public health and the environment. Not everyone needs to have a new system installed. Your septic system can last many years if properly installed and maintained.

Periodic pumping of Pump Tanks / Vaults is needed to prevent sewage materials from being discharged into absorption areas.
Over years of operation, accumulated sewage solids begin taking up too much room in the tank, reducing the volume available for settling. When this happens, floating materials easily escape the tank and can clog delivery pipes and eventually the disposal field. This can cause a hydraulic back-up into the house or an overflow onto the ground surface. Regular septic tank pump-outs (every 2-3 years) should be done, as part of an over-all maintenance program.
Many pumping companies simply “PUMP & RUN”. This means their operators will use the most convenient opening (no matter what size), pump out the top layer of scum, gray water (effluent) and most of the sludge, then leave.

A basic septic tank system is made up of the septic tank itself, the drain field and the soil. Having said this, a more sophisticated tank, which can be constructed of plastic, fibreglass or concrete, can also feature a pump chamber and an overflow tank. If you are installing a septic tank and are looking at your options, you need to know what these features are.
Before we jump into explaining pump chambers and over flow tanks, let us first give you an understanding of what a septic tank does. In simple terms, wastewater enters the septic tank through the pipelines leading from your home. Once in the tank, the system begins to separate the waste by sinking the solids to the bottom forming the sludge layer and the lighter particles of waste rising to the top forming a level of scum.
This is the point at which the pump chamber comes into play. A pump chamber is installed after the septic tank and contains an effluent pump, control floats and a high water alarm. The main purpose of the pump chamber is to disperse the effluent when your site has a high water level or if the gradients for drainage are unfavourable. When the effluent in the pump tank rises to a level determined by a control float, the pump

If neglected entirely, they can be very difficult to ignore once something does go wrong. Domestic treatment plants and septic tanks of all kinds need regular maintenance.
Before you can maintain your septic system, you'll need to know how it works! Here are the fundamentals for the most common types of systems, and some of the issues which can arise.
If a building has a gravity septic system to treat waste water, then all the main drainage pipes in it are connected to one main exit pipe. This exit pipe feeds waste water to the septic tank, usually located underground and not far from the building. Anything put down the drain goes to the septic tank.
Here, the waste water separates in to solid and liquid. Solids fall to the bottom of the tank to form the sludge layer, effluent sits in the middle, and any liquids lighter than water (such as oils) sit at the top forming the scum layer.
An outlet pipe makes sure that only the effluent flows out of the tank and into the soil in the drainage field. Typically, the outlet is connected to a distribution box, which ensures that the effluent is equally dispersed into the pipes in the drainage field. Finally, holes in the drainage field pipes allow the safe effluent to flow into the soil. These pipes are surrounded by a layer of

Septic tanks are usually located about 7 ft from the house wall where the largest vent pipe on the roof of the house is. There is usually a cap on the ground next to the wall (which may or may not be buried in some cases), this cap is an opening where your septic company technician can run a drain opener through the pipes to clear any pipeline clogs (it is not a place to pump out a septic tank). The access to pump out a tank is on top of the tank and is usually sealed to be water tight.
The drainfield is usually near the tank, and in some instances it may be in a different area or elevated on the property (a “mound system”) where a pump in another separate tank pumps the water “up” to a higher elevation.

Some older systems still in use are no longer permitted under current Health Department regulations. If in doubt contact your local county health department. Another major advantage of newer systems is the use of PVC lines and other modern plumbing techniques which greatly reduce the risk of system backups if the system is properly maintained. Installation of new systems generally means easier access for pump outs with lids initially placed at or above ground level. This eliminates the need to dig up the lawn. New systems have secondary treatment systems to further treat the water before it gets discharged.

An attache at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, 1963-1965, and later the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, he offers an overview of U.S. relations with Iraq, the U.S. betrayal of the Kurds, and details how Saddam and the U.S. have both used each other and misread each other over the past three decades.
He is Deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdish Democratic Party and a member of its Politiburo. In 1970, when the Kurds negotiated a power-sharing agreement with Vice President Saddam Hussein, he was one of four Kurdish leaders who joined the Iraqi government. In this interview he talks about his personal encounters over the years with Saddam, the U.S. betrayal of the Kurds and the lingering questions about U.S. support for them now. He also explains his concerns if Saddam Hussein leaves power.

The appointments, announced in a decree from the royal court, further thrust a new generation of Saudi princes into the line of succession and mapped out the future of the throne for potentially decades to come.
The post of crown prince secures Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 55, as the most likely successor to the king. The prince, who is also the interior minister, is widely known internationally as Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism czar and was previously also deputy crown prince.
The prince becomes the first from among his generation to be elevated to such a high position — first in line to the throne. He has survived several assassination attempts, including one in 2009 by al-Qaida. He takes over the post of crown prince from Prince Muqrin.
The royal decree also announced that the king's son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been appointed deputy crown prince. He is believed to be around 30 years old and is also the country's defense minister. As deputy crown prince, he is essentially seen as being second in line to the throne.

The UK Pink Floyd Experience, a Pink Floyd tribute band, recently announced that it will not perform its three scheduled shows in Israel. This announcement follows the oh-so-usual approach by BDS-poster boy Roger Waters, former front man for the original Pink Floyd band, who urged the tribute band not to play in Israel.
Roger, as I pointed out to you, my concern was for my colleagues and the abuse and threats they were receiving as a result of your initial post. This remains the main reason for issuing the cancelation post. We do not support either side in this. We were simply hoping to bring music to the people.
So it is neither ideological conviction nor support for the Palestinian cause that prompted this cancelation. It was fear, brought on by a frontal assault of abuse and threats, an assault ordered by Roger Waters. Power makes a direct connection between this assault and the cancelation, leaving no room for doubt or a hijacking of the agenda: The cancelation was due to the threat of violence – brought on by Waters.

The show was simply amazing. I got great seats about 15 rows back from the stage, and very near the center, for my friend Erik and I. And, I was able to get a few really nice photos and videos with my Pixel 2.

Formed in Cambridge back in 1965, Pink Floyd has established itself as one of the greatest rock bands in the history of rock and roll. In its five decades, Pink Floyd, which got its name from a combination of the names of American blues musicians Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, has sold more than 200 million albums.
But how exactly did the band get its start? Here's everything you need to know about Pink Floyd.
The band that eventually became known as Pink Floyd started by performing covers of American R&B songs. When Syd Barrett joined the group in 1965 he began writing most of the band's songs and moved the group into the burgeoning psychedelic rock movement. Surreal lyrics and experimental electronic effects established the band as the British epicenter of psych rock.
After two albums, Barrett self-destructed due to mental instability aggravated by drug use. He was replaced by David Gilmour in 1968. The band continued to experiment, increasingly incorporating classical and jazz influences into their music.
Their innovative musical styles and flashy stage production in live performances established them as a commercially successful band with a unique sound, at the forefront of the rock opera genre with heir 1979 epic The Wall.
Between the mid-70s and mid-80s, Roger Waters increasingly asserted control over the band's sound and overall direction. In 1985, Waters left to pursue a solo career and declared that Pink Floyd was done. A subsequent court battle proved otherwise, as David Gilmour retained the right to use the band's name

“We were set on playing Detroit, and once we spoke with the guys from Musician Friends of Porter, we knew we wanted to partner with them for the show,” said Tom Beller, Echoes of Pink Floyd bassist.
Echoes of Pink Floyd has played around the midwest for years, but has not been back to Detroit since 2012. The show comes at a perfect time, as Pink Floyd recently announced the release of their first new album in over 20 years.
Musician Friends of Porter was established for the young son of local musician Brandon Creasman who passed away in 2010. Creasman’s son Porter is autistic, and music has been very therapeutic in his development.
“Porter’s mother and family do an amazing job raising him, taking care of him and making sure all his needs are met.

It features footage of a concert Gilmour performed at the Hammersmith Odeon in London during his 1984 European tour which started shortly after the release of his second solo album, About Face. He performs not only selections from his first two solo albums, but also includes performances of a couple Pink Floyd numbers (Run Like Hell and Comfortably Numb). In addition, Roy Harper performs guest vocals on Short and Sweet and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason performs on Comfortably Numb.
The concert is really, really low-tech compared to the large light shows Pink Floyd did. From what I understand, most of the venues Gilmour performed at were smaller "theater-like" places, unlike the big stadiums Floyd did. Nonetheless, the low-tech appearance does not distract from the music, all performed quite well, even the Pink Floyd numbers.
In addition to the concert footage, this VHS tape includes two music videos, one of Blue Light, the other of All Lovers Are Deranged. These are just plain silly. Gilmour looks really out of touch on these, especially with that 1980s attire. They also look like they were cheaply done.

After leaving the group Blood, Sweat and Tears, the legendary American guitarist Mike Stern took the jazz world by storm in 1981 as part of the Miles Davis comeback band, when he introduced a totally new and innovative style of guitar playing consisting of a unique blend of elements from bebop, blues and rock. The now 66 year old guitar icon - originally from Boston but a New Yorker for many decades - is considered one of his generation's greatest and most influential guitarists. Last year Mike Stern delivered a mind-blowing concert run with us at the National Museum paying tribute one of his greatest idols - Jimi Hendrix. This time around we are going to expand the concept to include a broader range of artists from the 1960s psychedelic rock, including Pink Floyd, The Doors, Cream, Jefferson Airplane and of course, Jimi Hendrix.
Joining Mike Stern on stage is compelling cast of musicians including Danish icon Niels Lan Doky on piano, French bass virtuoso Francois Moutin and, for the first time with us, identical twin brother, Louis Moutin, who is also a highly acclaimed drummer on the international jazz scene, not least in the USA and his native France.

“We try to be exactly right not just in how we sound, but even in our movements and gestures on stage,” Szczepanowski said.

Bao Bao played outside for about two hours, with her mother Mei Xiang watching carefully nearby. Before the playful panda cub could be allowed outside, zookeepers had to baby proof the outdoor areas so it was safe for her to explore.
The baby proofing included shaving trees and putting rings around them so the cub could not climb too high and get stuck or fall and get hurt. They also spread hay underneath the trees to help cushion the area incase Bao Bao would fall.

The zoo announced last Monday, Aug. 7., that their mama panda, Yang Yang, had given birth to one cub. But keepers soon became suspicious after hearing what sounded like the squeaks of not one, but two baby pandas coming from the breeding box.
Those suspicions were confirmed on Friday, Aug. 12, when Yang Yang was caught on camera cradling twin baby pandas, the zoo said in a news release on its website today.
Because the zoo believes in natural rearing, keepers had only been monitoring the pandas via camera, Dagmar Schratter, the zoo's director, explained in the news release.
"It had sounded as if there were two young animals squeaking, but the pictures only ever showed one," Schratter said. But on Friday "keepers could see two babies on the screen for the first time."

The cubs arrived about five hours apart Saturday (Aug. 22). Panda mom Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) gave birth to the first cub at 5:35 p.m. and a second at 10:07 p.m., the zoo said. If the cubs survive, they would be the 17-year-old panda's third and fourth surviving offspring.
Mei Xiang's first cub, Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. Her second cub, Bao Bao, turned 2 years old Sunday and still lives at the zoo, which is in Washington.
The new additions mean that for the first time, the zoo has five pandas in residence. In addition to Bao Bao, Mei Xiang and the new cubs, the zoo is also home to an adult male panda named Tian Tian. In the past, the zoo has never had more than three pandas at one time.
Zoo director Dennis Kelly said following the first cub's birth that he was "so happy, so pleased, so excited." The zoo's chief veterinarian Don Neiffer was also asked about the possibility of a second cub. In 2013, when Mei Xiang gave birth to Bao Bao, she also gave birth to a stillborn cub.

"In a sense there's no answer, but there is speculation that perhaps pandas' bodies just rehearse pregnancy all the time," Lisa Stevens, curator of primates and pandas at Smithsonian's National Zoo, told the news outlet.

Bai Yun arrived in San Diego in 1996, a year before the zoo began its multi-year breeding program with Bai Yun and another panda, Shi Shi.
The two pandas arrived as the species was on the verge of extinction and helped researchers learn a great deal about panda behavior, pregnancy, birth, and maternal care, according to the zoo.
Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature reclassified the giant panda as "vulnerable," instead of endangered.
"Bai Yun has been an amazing asset to our panda conservation program over the past two decades,” Kathy Hawk, senior keeper at the San Diego Zoo, said. "Since she’s been at the San Diego Zoo, we’ve learned a great deal about her and her species through her—including mother-infant relationships and overall panda biology. And for that we celebrate her."
The mother of six celebrated her birthday with envelopes and boxes packed with cake, hay, and other snacks - before lying down for a well-earned nap.
The San Diego Zoo's giant pandas are in San Diego on a research loan from the People's Republic of China as part of a long-term, panda conservancy program.
Scientists estimate there are about 2,000 giant pandas living in their native habitats, the majority of which are adults.

The male and female pair landed at Jakarta's international airport from Chengdu and will be quarantined at Taman Safari zoo outside the capital for about a month before the public can visit.

In honor of Red Panda Day, we put together our favorite photos of the bushy-tailed, tree-dwelling mammal.
With its bushy tail, little-old-man eyebrows, and rust-colored coat, the red panda is difficult to resist. While in some corners of the Internet every day seems like Red Panda Day, September 19 is the official date to celebrate this charismatic creature.
Native to China, Myanmar (Burma), and other parts of Asia, red pandas are tree-dwelling, housecat-size mammals whose numbers have declined in recent years due to habitat loss.
Many of the red pandas seen cavorting on YouTube videos are young ones engaged in play, says PJ Jones, animal care manager at the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, which is home to red pandas. "You will see some play behavior from older [red pandas], but not nearly as much as from the cubs."
As a whole, though, the red panda is "more of a lover than a fighter," she says. They mostly eat bamboo, but unlike the giant panda, red pandas will also consume eggs and the occasional small mammal.
Red pandas have a wrist bone that sticks out like a thumb and helps them grip shoots of bamboo. It's something they have in common with giant pandas and it's why the two species were initially both classified as pandas on the family tree, Jones says.
Now, scientists have grouped giant pandas with bears and red pandas remain the sole member of the panda family.

Those suspicions were confirmed on Friday, Aug. 12, when Yang Yang was caught on camera cradling twin baby pandas, the zoo said in a news release on its website today.
Because the zoo believes in natural rearing, keepers had only been monitoring the pandas via camera, Dagmar Schratter, the zoo's director, explained in the news release.

Mei Xiang's first cub, Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. Her second cub, Bao Bao, turned 2 years old Sunday and still lives at the zoo, which is in Washington.
The new additions mean that for the first time, the zoo has five pandas in residence. In addition to Bao Bao, Mei Xiang and the new cubs, the zoo is also home to an adult male panda named Tian Tian. In the past, the zoo has never had more than three pandas at one time.

The zoo's chief veterinarian Don Neiffer was also asked about the possibility of a second cub. In 2013, when Mei Xiang gave birth to Bao Bao, she also gave birth to a stillborn cub.

In 1977, some 400,000 visitors flocked to Tierpark Berlin to marvel at female panda Chi Chi, who was making a brief stopover in the capital of the German Democratic Republic. However, both Chi Chi and Happy soon moved onto other zoos after their appearances in Berlin.
On 5 November 1980, Berlin’s first panda couple Bao Bao and Tjen Tjen arrived in the western part of the city, as a gift from the Chinese leader Hua Guofeng to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Bao Bao lived to the ripe old age of 34, eventually passing away on 22 August 2012. At that time, he was the oldest male panda in the world and the last panda living in Berlin. In June 2017, thanks to the efforts of Chancellor Angela Merkel, panda pair Meng Meng and Jiao Qing arrived at Zoo Berlin, marking the return of giant pandas to Berlin.

Giant pandas are notoriously reluctant to mate in captivity. Following an artificial insemination from her mate, Xing Hui, 6-year-old Hao Hao gave birth to her first cub at the Pairi Daiza Wildlife Park, outside of Brussels.

Immediately after the cub was born, Hao Hao scooped it up in her mouth, cleaned the wee one and held it close to her body, according to zoo staff.
The giant panda is considered at risk of extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). As such, "the panda is a true miracle," zoo officials said in a joint statement with the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.

Finland and the People’s Republic of China signed a 15-year agreement on joint research on giant pandas last spring. The removal of Lumi and Pyry to Ahtari Zoo is part of the agreement.
The Finnish climate with its snowy winter is similar to that in the giant pandas’ natural habitat in the mountains in China.

The history of “panda diplomacy” can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). As according to Japanese royal yearbook, the Chinese emperor sent the Japanese ruler two “white bears” and 70 pieces of their fur in 685. The two “white bears” referred to were pandas.
In modern times, pandas have continued to play important diplomatic roles. From 1957 to 1982, China sent a total of 23 pandas to nine countries, all as gifts. Since 1982, China no longer “gives” pandas, instead we “lend” them to overseas zoos for joint research. Each panda lives overseas for 10 years in general, and wherever they give births, the newborns are considered Chinese “citizens”. The only exceptions are the Hongkong, Macau, and Taiwan. In 2008, the Chinese mainland sent Taiwan a pair of pandas called Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, whose names when combined mean “family reunion”.
As a cultural symbol of China, pandas have numerous fans worldwide, and some of them have become quite famous.

Yet despite these promising signs, the panda's pregnancy was a false alarm.
According to China's Southern Metropolis Daily, ultrasound scans determined that Yuan Yuan, who was artificially inseminated earlier this year, was not pregnant. Now the panda is being accused of faking the pregnancy as a way of getting her caretakers to shower her with better food and care.
"This phenomenon occurs in 10 to 20 percent of pandas," he said. "After the mother panda is inseminated, if her health isn't so good, the pregnancy will terminate, but she'll still behave as if she's pregnant."
According to a 2010 LiveScience report, scientists "don't know why pseudo-pregnancies happen, or if they have evolved for an evolutionary purpose."

Bai Yun arrived in San Diego in 1996, a year before the zoo began its multi-year breeding program with Bai Yun and another panda, Shi Shi.
The two pandas arrived as the species was on the verge of extinction and helped researchers learn a great deal about panda behavior, pregnancy, birth, and maternal care, according to the zoo.
Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature reclassified the giant panda as "vulnerable," instead of endangered.
"Bai Yun has been an amazing asset to our panda conservation program over the past two decades,” Kathy Hawk, senior keeper at the San Diego Zoo, said. "Since she’s been at the San Diego Zoo, we’ve learned a great deal about her and her species through her—including mother-infant relationships and overall panda biology. And for that we celebrate her."
The mother of six celebrated her birthday with envelopes and boxes packed with cake, hay, and other snacks - before lying down for a well-earned nap.

In honor of Red Panda Day, we put together our favorite photos of the bushy-tailed, tree-dwelling mammal.
With its bushy tail, little-old-man eyebrows, and rust-colored coat, the red panda is difficult to resist. While in some corners of the Internet every day seems like Red Panda Day, September 19 is the official date to celebrate this charismatic creature.
Native to China, Myanmar (Burma), and other parts of Asia, red pandas are tree-dwelling, housecat-size mammals whose numbers have declined in recent years due to habitat loss.
Many of the red pandas seen cavorting on YouTube videos are young ones engaged in play, says PJ Jones, animal care manager at the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, which is home to red pandas. "You will see some play behavior from older [red pandas], but not nearly as much as from the cubs."
As a whole, though, the red panda is "more of a lover than a fighter," she says. They mostly eat bamboo, but unlike the giant panda, red pandas will also consume eggs and the occasional small mammal.
Red pandas have a wrist bone that sticks out like a thumb and helps them grip shoots of bamboo. It's something they have in common with giant pandas and it's why the two species were initially both classified as pandas on the family tree, Jones says.
Now, scientists have grouped giant pandas with bears and red pandas remain the sole member of the panda family.

That’s what Matthew Metz did at D’Youville in early 2017. He knows that the key to managing change on campus is communications—and lots of it.
Metz is no stranger to motivating student engagement. He’s been at D'Youville in Buffalo, New York, since 2003—and is now the Assistant Vice President for Enrollment Management. Last year, as Director of Financial Aid, he oversaw the implementation and rollout of StudentForms, part of the CampusLogic student financial services platform.
When it came time to explain to 3,000 students how to create their new online FinAid accounts, he flipped on as many communications channels as possible—and introduced paperless financial aid as a cornerstone of the school’s “go-green” initiative. Email messaging, notices on the school website and student portal, an array of social media posts, and ground-based events were all part of his integrated rollout strategy.
Metz presented “How to Make Student Communications Stick” at NYSFAA last year, using many examples from that rollout and explaining The Rule of 7—the idea that students need to see a message at least seven times before they’ll take action. “Whether you have 3,000 or 30,000 students, this theory holds,” he says.
The calls-to-action on emails and social media link directly to a “Forms” page, encouraging all FAFSA-filing students to activate their accounts. This special landing page on the school’s financial aid website connects with D'Youville’s sustainability initiative by directly calling out this new, paperless process.

This application enables the student to apply for all sources of financial assistance awarded by the college as well as the Federal Pell Grant. Upon completion of the application procedures outlined below, the applicant will have applied for all sources of aid available through the Financial Aid Office. Applications should be submitted to the Federal Government by May 1 for students enrolling in August (fall semester) or November 1 for students enrolling in January (spring semester). Adhering to these deadlines will assure students of priority consideration and an answer concerning eligibility before the semester begins. However, applications are accepted throughout the academic year since financial aid is awarded to students until funds are depleted.
Financial aid is granted on the basis of need. A student’s financial need is the difference between the total cost of one academic year of study at the College and the total resources available to the student, based on information supplied on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The amount of aid awarded to a particular student is determined by the Financial Aid Office and depends on the student’s financial need and the availability of funds. The cost of education includes the direct costs of tuition, fees, books and supplies, and indirect costs including personal expenses, transportation, meals, and housing costs.
Students may appeal any decision under the SAP Policy. A student must complete the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form which one can obtain from the financial aid office

The Director of Financial Aid at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) knew her staff of 17 was in for trouble if she couldn’t figure out how best to handle the forecasted deluge of uncertainty, confusion, and upset students who would likely be asked to jump through more hoops—and/or potentially lose the financial aid they were counting on.
The transition to early FAFSA and PPY has created a perfect storm of unintended consequences that will last exactly one year—and potentially hit returning students the hardest.
It’s a one-time situation in which two aid years (2016‑17 and 2017‑18) will use income tax return information from 2015. A new Comment Code 399 is generated that requires schools to compare that two-year-old income data if it doesn’t jibe with information previously filed by the student. The Department of Education flags the application, but it’s up to the school to determine if the flag is valid, make the needed corrections, and adjust the amount of aid awarded to the student based on updated income information.
Financial Aid professionals agree that the idea behind early FAFSA is a good one—streamlining access to college by accepting aid applications as early as October, rather than January, and allowing applicants to use “prior-prior year” income tax returns to do so. The expectation is that early

“The families that are most likely to fall prey to the myths are the ones not looking for information about them,” says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FastWeb and FinAid websites about college aid.
1. Savings hurt opportunities for financial aid.
There’s only a slight penalty for savings.
The formula that colleges use as a guideline for setting awards calls for parents to contribute a maximum 5.64 percent of their assets per year toward the cost of college. (If the amount is in the student’s name, he or she is expected to contribute 20 percent.) And parents can shield a significant amount of savings from that calculation ? typically about $50,000 but with slightly higher allotments for older parents. If the older parent is 50, for example, the family can shield the first $52,900 of assets. If 55, it’s $60,200.

The government's Federal Student Aid site explains the main sources of financial aid for most students, almost all of it tied to information that students and families will provide by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa — an unfriendly, but unavoidable, part of college-going. Foresighted students will click on "repaying your loans" to get an idea of how life will look after graduation. Take special note of the loan-forgiveness program for people who go into public-service jobs.
OK, we hope that leaving an e-mail address at this site will not add spam to our in-box, but so be it. What we got by signing up at College Made Simple is a newsletter listing "9 new ways to beat the high cost of college." You may find these tips from college funding adviser Scott Weingold revealing. He includes some advice on how to legally game the Fafsa form just by understanding it better. For example, parents' retirement savings such as 401(k) funds shouldn't be reported. Lumping them in as part of your assets could cost you in financial aid.

That’s what Matthew Metz did at D’Youville in early 2017. He knows that the key to managing change on campus is communications—and lots of it.
Metz is no stranger to motivating student engagement. He’s been at D'Youville in Buffalo, New York, since 2003—and is now the Assistant Vice President for Enrollment Management. Last year, as Director of Financial Aid, he oversaw the implementation and rollout of StudentForms, part of the CampusLogic student financial services platform.
When it came time to explain to 3,000 students how to create their new online FinAid accounts, he flipped on as many communications channels as possible—and introduced paperless financial aid as a cornerstone of the school’s “go-green” initiative. Email messaging, notices on the school website and student portal, an array of social media posts, and ground-based events were all part of his integrated rollout strategy.
Metz presented “How to Make Student Communications Stick” at NYSFAA last year, using many examples from that rollout and explaining The Rule of 7—the idea that students need to see a message at least seven times before they’ll take action. “Whether you have 3,000 or 30,000 students, this theory holds,” he says.
The calls-to-action on emails and social media link directly to a “Forms” page, encouraging all FAFSA-filing students to activate their accounts. This special landing page on the school’s financial aid website connects with D'Youville’s sustainability initiative by directly calling out this new, paperless process.

The Director of Financial Aid at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) knew her staff of 17 was in for trouble if she couldn’t figure out how best to handle the forecasted deluge of uncertainty, confusion, and upset students who would likely be asked to jump through more hoops—and/or potentially lose the financial aid they were counting on.
The transition to early FAFSA and PPY has created a perfect storm of unintended consequences that will last exactly one year—and potentially hit returning students the hardest.
It’s a one-time situation in which two aid years (2016‑17 and 2017‑18) will use income tax return information from 2015. A new Comment Code 399 is generated that requires schools to compare that two-year-old income data if it doesn’t jibe with information previously filed by the student. The Department of Education flags the application, but it’s up to the school to determine if the flag is valid, make the needed corrections, and adjust the amount of aid awarded to the student based on updated income information.
Financial Aid professionals agree that the idea behind early FAFSA is a good one—streamlining access to college by accepting aid applications as early as October, rather than January, and allowing applicants to use “prior-prior year” income tax returns to do so. The expectation is that early

But, while those scholarships might be described as the easiest scholarships to enter, the time and work you might need to apply to find scholarships adds up — as do the odds against your winning any given “easy” scholarship.
Few studies have been conducted on your odds of winning a scholarship. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which is conducted every 3-4 years, showed that students at four-year colleges represent 71.5 percent of scholarship recipients in 2003-04 and 77.0 percent of scholarship recipients in 2007-08.
If you further restrict the data to just the students who were enrolled full-time at 4-year institutions, 12.1 percent of students, or about 1 in 8, received scholarships worth $2,223 on average in 2003-04 and 10.6 percent of students, or about 1 in 10, received scholarships worth $2,815 on average in 2007-08. Full-time students at four-year schools represented 63.2 percent of scholarship recipients in 2003-04 and 69.4 percent of scholarship recipients in 2007-08 (breakdown of this information is found at FinAid).

Families have to educate themselves about this complex world and stay on top of it. Their homework lasts from the beginning of the college selection process in the junior year of high school through at least the receipt of financial aid packages in the spring of senior year. Colleges don’t spell out everything they need to know, so it’s important to be able to ask informed questions and see past any false assumptions.
Those who avoid the pitfalls can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars. But if they’re not diligent, parents can set back their finances and even their retirement prospects.
“The families that are most likely to fall prey to the myths are the ones not looking for information about them,” says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FastWeb and FinAid websites about college aid.
1. Savings hurt opportunities for financial aid.
There’s only a slight penalty for savings.
The formula that colleges use as a guideline for setting awards calls for parents to contribute a maximum 5.64 percent of their assets per year toward the cost of college. (If the amount is in the student’s name, he or she is expected to contribute 20 percent.) And parents can shield a significant amount of savings from that calculation ? typically about $50,000 but with slightly higher allotments for older parents. If the older parent is 50, for example, the family can shield the first $52,900 of assets. If 55, it’s $60,200.

He is notable for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making, behavioral economics and hedonic psychology. With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors which arise from heuristics and biases (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory. In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book THINKING, FAST AND SLOW, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.
Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives --- and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

So it is good to know that we can actually start to understand the conscious and unconscious biases that help explain apparently irrational and even self-damaging decision-making. Look no further than Nobel Prizewinner for Economics, Daniel Kahneman, listed as the seventh most influential economist in the world by The Economist in 2015. Funny thing, Kahneman isn’t an economist. His work, with fellow psychologist, the late and great Amos Tversky, shattered the notion that people make rational judgements, even when objective information is available. Their research output goes a long way towards explaining the extraordinary decisions we make not only as consumers, but as voters, investors, policy makers and marketers.
For starters, he exposes the weakness of market research in informing marketing strategy. Consumers don’t think what they feel, don’t say what they think and don’t do what they say. They simply cannot give a reliable account of why they choose one product over another because they don’t understand their own hidden biases. Even our market researchers are unreliable witnesses.

In the early 1970s just such a revolution occurred when economics was rocked by two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose experiments scientifically questioned the truth of economics’ classic assumption that people behave hyper rationally. This questioning became a revolution that now is an entire branch of scientific inquiry: behavioral economics. As in all scientific pursuits, theories were developed, predictions were made, and the status quo established.
Kahneman and Tversky described the human brain, and resultant behavior, as psychologists. Yet there is also a view of behavior that is oriented in matter and not in human choices; biologists believe that matter is the ground for all phenomena. So consciousness and behavior arise as an epiphenomenon. That is, behavior is the result of the highly complex inter-workings of physical componentry, such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Now some of these neuroscientists are launching an economics revolution of their own, neuroeconomics, that seeks to combine insights from psychology, economics, and biology into a single discipline that studies human choice.

It is one of a group of heuristics (simple rules governing judgment or decision making) proposed by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the early 1970s. Heuristics are described as “judgmental shortcuts that generally get us where we need to go – and quickly – but at the cost of occasionally sending us off course.” Heuristics are useful because they use effort-reduction and simplification in decision making.
Tversky and Kahneman defined representativeness as “the degree to which [an event] (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated”. When people rely on representativeness to make judgments, they are likely to judge wrongly because the fact that something is more representative does not make it more likely. The representativeness heuristic is simply described as assessing similarity of objects and organizing them based around the category prototype (e.g. like goes with like and causes and effects should resemble each other. This heuristic is used because it is an easy computation. The problem is that people overestimate its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of an event. Thus it can result in neglect of relevant base rates and other cognitive biases.

Daniel Kahneman, a professor at Princeton who was the first psychologist to win the Nobel in economics (which he was awarded last year for studies he conducted with Amos Tversky), has attributed market manias partly to investors' ''illusion of control.'' Kahneman recently explained the basic weirdness of the dot-com bomb to The Financial Times: ''A high percentage of investors knew it was a bubble and still invested because they thought they could get out in time.'' Why did so few heed the alarms? According to Kahneman's ''prospect theory,'' most of us find losses roughly twice as painful as we find gains pleasurable. This radical precept subverts much of ''utility theory,'' the longstanding economic doctrine that says we weigh gain and loss rationally. When combined with the reality that some market winners display the same recklessness as some victorious gamblers -- a phenomenon that Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago, calls ''the house-money effect'' -- the market is often revealed to be downright loony. Indeed, the findings of ''behavioral finance'' in recent years have increasingly challenged the fundamental rationality assumed by defenders of ''efficient markets,'' those who believe Eugene Fama's famous dictum that prices ''fully reflect available information.''

Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that pertains to the structure and behavior of the aggregate economy (at the regional, national or global level), rather than specific industries or individual firms. Macroeconomists are concerned with the performance and inter-relationships between broad phenomena including economic growth, inflation and unemployment.
The amount of attention that is devoted to macroeconomics in the financial media and the financial services industry would suggest that it is of critical importance to investment performance.
Not so. While economic news and data may be critical to traders, it is much less relevant to long-term, business-focused investors. In the words of legendary money manager Peter Lynch: "I've always said if you spend 13 minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 10 minutes."

His disarmingly simple experiments have profoundly changed the way we think about thinking. While philosophers, economists, and social scientists had assumed for centuries that human beings are rational agents — reason was our Promethean gift — Kahneman, the late Amos Tversky, and others, including Shane Frederick (who developed the bat-and-ball question), demonstrated that we’re not nearly as rational as we like to believe.
The philosopher, it turns out, got it backward. A new study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology led by Richard West at James Madison University and Keith Stanovich at the University of Toronto suggests that, in many instances, smarter people are more vulnerable to these thinking errors. Although we assume that intelligence is a buffer against bias — that’s why those with higher S.A.T. scores think they are less prone to these universal thinking mistakes — it can actually be a subtle curse.
West also gave a puzzle that measured subjects’ vulnerability to something called “anchoring bias,” which Kahneman and Tversky had demonstrated in the nineteen-seventies. Subjects were first asked if the tallest redwood tree in the world was more than X feet, with X ranging from eighty-five to a thousand feet. Then the students were asked to estimate the height of the tallest redwood tree in the world. Students exposed to a small “anchor” — like eighty-five feet — guessed, on average, that the tallest tree

Experiments are not beyond questioning; on the other hand, there should always exist some mountain of evidence which suffices to convince you. It's not impossible for researchers to make mistakes. It's also not impossible for experimental subjects to be really genuinely and truly biased. It happens. On both sides, it happens. We're all only human here.
If you think to extend a hand of charity toward experimental subjects, casting them in a better light, you should also consider thinking charitably of scientists. They're not stupid, you know. If you can see an alternative interpretation, they can see it too. This is especially important to keep in mind when you read about a bias and one or two illustrative experiments in a blog post.

Trying to insert human foibles back into analysis of cold data is difficult. As Lewis explained in the coda to his book, the data folks (economists) and the human mind folks (psychologists) didn’t like each other. So collaboration was problematic at best.

In the following years, Redelmeier and Kahneman applied this crucial insight to uncomfortable medical procedures, like colonoscopies, which, when modified to end in a less painful manner, made patients more willing to undergo further examinations. Other scholars seized on their exceptional insights and the medical profession is still finding new applications to this day.

By many accounts, Daniel Kahneman is the father of his field, Behavioral Economics, which is a mix between behavioral psychology and traditional economics and has provided perhaps the most fascinating material in recent pop science literature. While this book is no exception in that regard, it is plagued by the same deficiencies that other Behavioral Economics books are plagued by, and so doesn’t quite accomplish the potential of the new science.
The premise behind Behavioral Economics is that people are irrational. Countering the standard of the ‘rational agent model’, in which it is assumed that people think and act rationally based on their own interests, behavioral economists have shown that people consistently make decisions that are uneconomical and often self-defeating. The conclusion is that people cannot possibly be rational and that something else is going on.
Daniel Kahneman’s thesis is that everyone possesses two systems of thought–the first is automatic, emotional, and intuitive (‘fast’ as he summarizes it); the second is deliberate, logical, and controlled (‘slow’). This dichotomy means that we have the capacity for both reasoning and emotional functions; it also means that we are prone to mistakes. Kahneman shows how the two systems of thought are engaged and what happens when the two mix. Kahneman argues that we define ourselves by our ‘System 2’ slow thinking, but in reality, we are largely governed by our ‘System 1’ fast thinking. This is where a number of cognitive biases and errors come in.

If you're not already familiar with the major results from this fascinating area, this introduction will help you to appreciate the value of formal decision-aiding tools. Errors and bias in judgment is the first reason that organizations choose the wrong projects.
The fact that people's intuitive decisions are often strongly and systematically biased has been firmly established over the past 30 years by literally hundreds of empirical studies. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman received this year's Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this area. The conclusion reached by Kahneman and his colleagues is that people use unconscious shortcuts, termed heuristics, to cope with complex decisions. "In general, these heuristics are useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systematic errors".
Understanding heuristics and the errors they cause is important because it helps us find ways to counteract them. For example, when judging distance people use a heuristic that equates clarity with proximity. The clearer an object, the closer we perceive it to be. Although this heuristic is usually correct, it allows smog to trick us into thinking that objects are more distant than they are. This distortion poses dangers for airlines, so pilots are trained to rely more on instruments than on what they think they see out the cockpit window.

AHS received a $16,000 grant from the Centro Attività Scolastiche Italiane (C.A.S.IT., Inc.), an organization affiliated with the Italian Consulate, to bring Italian back to the district.
Yesterday, AHS Italian teacher, Dr. Antoni Di Sanzo, visited with the Italian Consulate to promote the program and speak with the Consul General, Guiseppe Pastorelli. Dr. Di Sanzo was also interviewed by Rai Italia, an Italian television network doing a piece on Italian language learning in the United States.
Already, students in Italian 1 are able to communicate with basic proficiency in Italian, thanks to Dr. Di Sanzo's excellent teaching. Recently, students completed an essay in which they introduced members of their family, saying what their names were, how old they were, describing them, and saying things they like to do. In the below sample, a student described the family from the movie, "The Incredibles." Dr. Di Sanzo was impressed with the progress his students are making after only a few months of study.

The Pharisees considered themselves the gatekeepers of the law. They felt it was up to them to make sure people followed many, many laws. Why?

The esteemed 19th-century psychologist William James went so far as to assert that if a person does not express an emotion, he has not felt it at all. Although few scientists would agree with such a statement today, there is evidence that emotions involve more than just the brain. The face, in particular, appears to play a big role.
This February psychologists at the University of Cardiff in Wales found that people whose ability to frown is compromised by cosmetic botox injections are happier, on average, than people who can frown. The researchers administered an anxiety and depression questionnaire to 25 females, half of whom had received frown-inhibiting botox injections. The botox recipients reported feeling happier and less anxious in general; more important, they did not report feeling any more attractive, which suggests that the emotional effects were not driven by a psychological boost that could come from the treatment’s cosmetic nature.
“It would appear that the way we feel emotions isn’t just restricted to our brain—there are parts of our bodies that help and reinforce the feelings we’re having,” says Michael Lewis, a co-author of the study. “It’s like a feedback loop.” In a related study from March, scientists at the Technical University of Munich in Germany scanned botox recipients with fMRI machines while asking them to mimic angry faces.

Usually, when we don’t live our potential, it’s not because of what others have done or said. We tend to get in our own way.

Some brave brides are taking part in a drastic craze which involves a change of 'do in the middle of their big day, in between the ceremony and the reception.
The trend started when one brave bride called Kayla decided to cut her long blonde hair into sleek bob moments before her first dance.
Kayla got her hair chopped by her sister AJ and even her husband didn't know about the new look.
AJ told Refinery 29: "More than half my brides cut off their hair immediately after their wedding. If you're planning on cutting your hair after the wedding -- why not just do it at the wedding, and make it the coolest second-look reveal?"

It poured down rain while Kayla was having hair and make up done at Hair Fusion (of course), but had slowed to a sprinkle, then completely stopped, for her session. We started with an umbrella, but only needed it for a few minutes. Kayla looked absolutely beautiful and we were all so excited for the gorgeous skies we got from the rain. The clouds were hanging low over the mountains so the backgrounds were stunning up at the Lion’s Den. After we shot a little bit downtown, we went up to the Lion’s Den, then finished the session by the river. The dramatic sky and beautiful soft light (enhanced with some off camera flash of course) made for some unique portraits, which I am so excited about! Kayla was so much fun to photograph and a great sport. She had been working 7 days a week because of the busy holiday (4th of July) so she was very tired. However; she was up for everything – even getting into the river. The gorgeous green water was perfect with her adorable coral dress.

The first thing is as hair texture. What you don&apos;t want when braiding the hair is having the hair be too soft. Because if it&apos;s too soft, too silky, it&apos;s just gonna slip right out of the braid. If you decide to start with the hair wet that&apos;s great, that&apos;s gonna give a lot of hold already, you can put, as the hair&apos;s wet, you can just put a little product in before, or if your hair is dry as Monica&apos;s is and just in the middle of the day you wanna start your braid you can put a little hair spray. You can see how even that just made it a lot more controlled. Now the hair has a little more grip, so when I go through the hair is gonna kind of naturally stay in the braid. The next thing you wanna do is if you have really short pieces you can still get it in a braid, and the way to do that is when you have your sections, you can twist the section, just twist it, now it&apos;s just gonna give you a little more hold in there.

With her blue eyes and natural brown hair, Dakota is a colour chameleon who can pull off blonde, brunette and red.

But after our last argument,which did NOT come to punches, I promised God and myself that the next time we had a disagreement we would talk it out, not scream,use foul language,or hit. And this time I kept my promise.
However, we did argue about the age old subject of my adoption. Mommy A got upset because the law recognizes Mommy N as Amani’s legal grandmother because Im her legal daughter. Mommy A felt that was unfair that the law discounts her as my mother. I told her she would not have had to worry about that if she had raised me herself.
What really upset me was how Mommy A seemed ungrateful to Mommy N for adopting me. She keot saying hurtful things to her lije “You’re not Jennice’s mother” and ” I have the scars to prove that I am her mother”. I could see the hurt on Mommy N’s face and that’s what really upset me.
I launched into a tirade about Mommy A still holding on to guilt from not raising me. She countered with accusations that I am still holding a grudge against her for giving me up. She got very agitated and insisted she did not give me up,but I was taken away from her by the state. To me, that was neither here nor there. I just wanted Mommy A to stop trying to make Mommy

So that leaves you to wonder, are relaxers bad for your hair? Take it from me, someone who has had a relaxer since I was very young, relaxers are NOT bad for your hair. They can, however, be damaging and do extensive harm to your hair if they are used incorrectly. So, when your hair is properly being cared for and it is done correctly, a relaxer is not going to make it unhealthy.
A lot of women don't realize that relaxers contain very harsh chemicals, mainly sodium hydroxide, in them. This is why it says on just about (and I say "just about" because I can admit that I have not looked at every relaxer kit to know for sure) every relaxer package "for professional use only". We hairstylists have actually been trained on how to correctly apply them which is why I always tell women to never do their relaxers at home. Also, lots of women who tell me the relaxers damaged their hair also admit to me that they did their own relaxers. This is not a coincidence. When done correctly a relaxer should never burn unless you have a scalp condition and should not damage your hair.
Doing it themselves- I know it is very tempting to do your own relaxer, especially when you really don't have the money to get it professionally done and you

In 2014, 19-year-old Kayla Newman began making Vine videos as “Peaches Monroee.” While she was already known by peers for her sense of humor, her account wasn't made in the name of viral comedy skits — instead, Newman began uploading short clips from the passenger seat of her mother’s car in Chicago, documenting her daily musings. That June, she posted a video where she coined the phrase “Eyebrows On Fleek,” and to her surprise, it broke the internet. But while major corporate entities embraced and profited off off Newman's work, she remains uncredited and uncompensated for it.
The FADER caught up with Newman to chat about her upcoming brand’s progress, the rise of the phrase “fleek,” and her determination to break into the beauty world as an “originator” in culture.

“Justin’s dead.” Kayla was crying; I could hear her through my staticky cell phone. I was visiting my parents for dinner, so I stepped into the living room to talk to her. I said the rightest things I could about how sorry I was and how fucked up it was. I didn’t say that I was glad he was gone.

There’s not much in the way of justice in this world; neither crime had been reported, and if they had they would have been hard to prosecute.
Kayla had had a baby two months before Justin’s death. She was only 23 and overwhelmed, so she’d opted for adoption. She chose the family through a private service.

The first thing is as hair texture. What you don&apos;t want when braiding the hair is having the hair be too soft.

You can see how even that just made it a lot more controlled. Now the hair has a little more grip, so when I go through the hair is gonna kind of naturally stay in the braid. The next thing you wanna do is if you have really short pieces you can still get it in a braid, and the way to do that is when you have your sections, you can twist the section, just twist it, now it&apos;s just gonna give you a little more hold in there.

With her blue eyes and natural brown hair, Dakota is a colour chameleon who can pull off blonde, brunette and red. But it wasn&apos;t until she committed to a rich brown with bangs for her breakout role in Fifty Shades of Grey that she started exuding real star power.

They can, however, be damaging and do extensive harm to your hair if they are used incorrectly. So, when your hair is properly being cared for and it is done correctly, a relaxer is not going to make it unhealthy.
A lot of women don't realize that relaxers contain very harsh chemicals, mainly sodium hydroxide, in them. This is why it says on just about (and I say "just about" because I can admit that I have not looked at every relaxer kit to know for sure) every relaxer package "for professional use only". We hairstylists have actually been trained on how to correctly apply them which is why I always tell women to never do their relaxers at home. Also, lots of women who tell me the relaxers damaged their hair also admit to me that they did their own relaxers. This is not a coincidence. When done correctly a relaxer should never burn unless you have a scalp condition and should not damage your hair.

It was time for that stock up we do every year. Unfortunately, I was much too tired to stock up like I thought I should ( I bought no soup, no chili, no tomato sauce, no meats). It wound up being staples - milk, chili powder, cat food, A1 - things that we've run out of and can't do without. And super tired = going out for dinner before shopping.
So after leaving the house after 5:00, going out to dinner, then going grocery shopping at Walmart, by the time I got back into the car to go home I was pooped. Thank goodness my husband was with me. He's good about letting me sit in the car while he loads the groceries in the back.
If it wasn't for him loading the groceries, I would never have seen what was tucked away in the "L" of the Walmart sign. Why I happened to look up at the sign on that particular part of the building, I'll never know - except to think maybe the universe knew I still needed a picture for the day.

My wife was slightly unwell then, and I was rather forced to do this on that particular week. Somehow I seem to have been stuck with the job at least for present.
I go to a grocery store near my house, which stocks besides the groceries, fresh vegetable too. This way, I can get rid of all weekly shopping within a span of an hour or so, with no botheration for rest of the week.

Surprisingly, they seem to be of all the age groups. Obviously there were lot of seniors like me, but there were also young men going around. The only difference between senior shoppers and young shoppers appeared to be that the young shoppers kept on talking to their wives at home taking guidance regarding purchases.
So has the doing groceries become a thing for guys? My experience at least suggests so. But is it only specific to India or the trend is international?

Thankfully, this awesome community is always quick to share the tips and tricks that can make life with fibro easier. Here are five tips to make grocery shopping less painful.
If you want to make your shopping trip as quick and easy as possible, make sure to plan ahead. That means knowing when the store is busiest and avoiding that time. Most people do their grocery shopping on the weekends or after work so if you can fit it into your schedule to go on a weekday morning, or later in the evening, the store will be much quieter and the checkout lanes won’t be overflowing with customers.
It also helps to not only make a grocery list but to organize it. I love using the Our Groceries app on my phone because not only do I remember to bring it with me (unlike my beautifully handwritten lists that so often end up on the counter at home) but it also makes it super easy to organize the list by department. That way I don’t have to walk all over the store following my list.
2.Choose your products with size and weight in mind.
Instead of purchasing big heavy bulk items, try buying the concentrated versions. (Think dish soap and laundry detergent or buying two half gallons of milk instead of full gallons.) While this can sometimes cost a few extra pennies, it usually isn’t worth the pain.

While the larger stores will be open, I wouldn’t recommend leaving your grocery shopping until Saturday, at least not if you want to find fresh food or half the items on your list.

Oh sure, at first it is exciting and perhaps even a little addicting to realize that by making just a few tweaks, you can actually cut your grocery bill in half. But eventually, once that initial thrill of filling your grocery cart for pennies on the dollar has finally worn off–and for some people that process takes longer than others–the reality is that being diligent about shopping the sales, finding the best deals, and using coupons can take its toll.
It’s called coupon burnout, and quite frankly, it happens to the best of us.
The problem is not that we don’t care, or even that we don’t want to save money. Who, after all, really wants to spend more than they have to? No, the problem is not a lack of desire, or even one of willpower. Most often, the problem of savings burnout comes from a combination of two things: a.) not enough time to focus on savings and b.) trying to save too much on too many things.
For some, our burnout comes primarily from a lack of time in the day. Between kids and activities and work responsibilities, we are stretched to the max and having to save money on groceries just feels like one more obligation. Conversely, some of us get so obsessed with saving money that we are trying to save everywhere on everything at all times. We become panicked at the thought of “missing” a deal. We check multiple
