It made perfect sense that Ann Dunwoody would too, just like her father, her grandfather and her great grandfather before her.
What was unlikely, when she joined, was that she - a woman - would rise to higher ranks than her father, a Brigadier General.
But she did, and on November 14, 2008, Ann E. Dunwoody became the first woman in U.S. military history to achieve the rank of General, which came with three more stars.
Dunwoody's trailblazing career started when she joined the Army after finishing college in 1974, and she was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps in 1975. Her first assignment was as a supply platoon leader, in the 100th Supply and Services Battalion (Direct Support), based at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Since then, she's served at every level of command, retiring in 2012, after 38 years in uniform, as the commander of the Army Material Command (AMC), one of the largest commands in the Army. She oversaw 69,000 employees across 50 states and 145 countries.
Her colleagues marveled at her tenacity and legacy.
"It wasn't because you were a woman, it was because you were a brilliant, dedicated officer, and you were quite simply the best logistician the Army has ever had," said then-Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.

Inspired by the strong women in her life, she followed in the footsteps of the few women who had gone before her in her effort to make the Foreign Service reflect the diverse faces of the United States. The youngest child of parents who left the segregated Old South to raise their family in Massachusetts, Elam-Thomas distinguished herself with a diplomatic career at a time when few colleagues looked like her.
Elam-Thomas’s memoir is a firsthand account of her decades-long career in the U.S. Department of State’s Foreign Service, recounting her experiences of making U.S. foreign policy, culture, and values understood abroad. Elam-Thomas served as a United States ambassador to Senegal (2000–2002) and retired with the rank of career minister after forty-two years as a diplomat. Diversifying Diplomacy presents the journey of this successful woman, who not only found herself confronted by some of the world’s heftier problems but also helped ensure that new shepherds of honesty and authenticity would follow in her international footsteps for generations to come.

Good natured smack talk was traded via twitter and terms were agreed upon. In the event of Chang's loss, Chang would put Questlove's chicken in his restaurants and feature him in the next issue of his magazine Lucky Peach. In the event of Questlove's loss, Questlove would do dishes at Momofuku as well as stand outside with a sandwich board and advertise for Chang. A final twist was added on the show when Questlove promised to forgo his normal shoutouts and instead honor Chang before every show.
Thursday night, that battle came to pass and only one man emerged victorious. The competition was judged by Steve Higgins, John Slattery and Tina Fey.
The winner, by unanimous decision, was David Chang. While the judges seemed to enjoy Questlove's chicken they were visibly moved by Chang's. Their deliberation was brief before they unhesitantly handed down their verdict.
Despite being crushed, 0-3, Questlove lost graciously to Chang. For his part, Chang was a gracious winner too, announcing that he will serve Questlove's chicken anyways and that the proceeds would go to support a food bank.

The first major trophy of the season is up for grabs on Sunday when Chelsea take on Manchester City in the final of the EFL Cup at Wembley.
Both sides have won the competition five times apiece in the past - a tally only Liverpool can beat - but there was a massive gulf between them when they met in the Premier League just two weeks ago, with Man City running out 6-0 winners on that occasion.
Sunday could prove to be a make-or-break moment in the managerial career of Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea, with pressure continuing to grow on the Italian boss.
Fixtures against Man City have provided both the zenith and the nadir of his time at Stamford Bridge so far, inflicting a first defeat of the season on Pep Guardiola's champions back in December but then suffering utter humiliation at the Etihad Stadium earlier this month.
Anything close to a repeat of that infamous 6-0 drubbing may be enough to see the sword fall on Sarri, whose refusal to tweak his tactical style is a growing source of frustration amongst the supporters.
Sarri need only look across the dugout to Guardiola for an example of a recent Premier League manager who also resisted pressure to alter his football philosophy amid first-season questions, although not too many Chelsea supporters would expect their current boss to lead them to the heights Guardiola has done with City.

Everyone began to argue. "We said we would keep mother and child safe, and that's what we'll do," said some. "But they will bring us bad luck!" said others.
And so the woman found herself alone again. She wondered what to do with this awkward child. She wondered what to do with herself.
But finally she had to accept that he was her child and she was his mother. Now, if the child had stayed that same, small size, everything might have been different.
But the donkey child grew and grew until he could no longer fit on his mother's back. And no matter how hard he tried, he could not behave like a human being. His mother was often tired and frustrated. Sometimes she made him do work meant for animals.
Confusion and anger built up inside Donkey. He couldn't do this and he couldn't do that. He couldn't be like this and he couldn't be like that. He became so angry that, one day, he kicked his mother to the ground.

The 48-year-old man has two biological children who are not yet 35 years old, the age he designated that they will have access to the trust, so he legally adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend as his daughter, which would entitle her to one third of the assets in the trust.
His civil trial and criminal trial for DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a crash for an accident that left a 23-year-old man dead are both scheduled to begin in March. He could face a lengthy prison term if convicted, and wants to protect the assets in the trust for his children.
The court hearing the lawsuit has ruled that the trust assets cannot be considered part of the man's assets in the event punitive damages are awarded. The family of the accident victim thinks that portion of the trust should be available for the lawsuit since the man effectively has control over that money.

With time, however, those ties have become more tenuous. To be sure, there still exists a significant crowd of collectors with strong ties to their old iron. Yet even then, many of those ties are likely looser than they might have been years ago.

Do you need genealogy proof for hard-to-find ancestors?
1. Genealogies, Family Histories, and Pedigree Charts. Your genealogy may already be compiled–a survey I did of my clients’ surnames and the compiled sources at the Family History Library in 2000 revealed that more than 80% of these client surnames had one or more compiled genealogy records already on file in the Library! Break your Losing Streak! Search these sources. And first! You can get up to 300 years of genealogy in one source.
2. Sources of Birth, Marriage, Death, and Divorce. What sources yield births, marriages, and deaths? Did you know that there are at least 16 official marriage records and more than 125 different sources with marriage evidence? Most of us give up too soon in our search for these vital dates.
3. Census Records, Inhabitants Lists, and Census Substitutes. More than 30 different kinds of census enumerations were recorded throughout the American Colonies before 1800: pre-1850 lists can be used to match them with other records that identify the members of the household. No other source category is better indexed, has such uniform and consistent data fields, or is as easily searched as American census records. Special search strategies can reveal “hidden” evidence often overlooked in your rush to gather ancestors quickly.
4. Probate and other Court Records. Over 95% of all American adults have appeared in at least one court during their lifetimes. These records are essential to your genealogy and ignoring them or by-passing their data usually leads

During her early years Naomi lived in global fashion centre Rome – where her mother worked as an exotic dancer. She was born for the stage; starting from age three she attended the Barbara Speake Stage School and at age ten, she studied ballet at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London.

The book was written by Barbara Taylor Bradford and published in 1969. I haven’t read the book. I’m fairly certain I took the book home with me because the title captured my intrigue. Whatever I thought then, I now think, mercy!
I have to say, I’m impressed by the woman I found on Bradford’s website. She comes across as classy, elegant, confident, strong. But what on earth? A series on how to be the perfect wife?! goodheavens! Then again, married for 52 years definitely lends credibility. All right, I’m still intrigued, I guess. When I get to New York City, I’m looking her up. To take her to lunch.
Anyway, here’s something interesting: apparently Bradford wrote this book before she became famous. When A Woman of Substance took the world by storm in 1979, it propelled Bradford to literature fame. Like owning one of those baseball cards in mint condition of a rookie who goes on to become famous, that’s the case with this book. I could only locate one copy of this book on Amazon and it’s a used copy going for $90.
No rating, as I haven’t read it.
I’m leaving it on my bookshelf. Bradford — the woman herself — has sparked my imagination.

Pyschoanalyst and author Margarete Mitscherlich died in a clinic in Frankfurt am Main on Tuesday, a few weeks before her 95th birthday. She had worked for years as a psychoanalyst at the Sigmund Freud Institute in Frankfurt, where a Freud doll adorned her office desk.
Born Margarete Nielsen in 1917 to a Danish doctor and a German mother, a schoolteacher, Mitscherlich became most famous for a collaborative work with her husband, Alexander. The pair had married in 1955, and met when researching the mass hysteria of the Nazi era among ordinary German people.
They published "Die Unfähigkeit zu trauern" ("The Inability to Mourn") in 1967, an exploration of Germany's attempts to come to terms with the Second World War in the era of post-war Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.
The couple concluded that not enough had been done to address the Nazi era, and called on Germans to embark on more collective attempts to do so. The book became one of the emblems of the student movement in Germany.
Mitscherlich became a leading figure of the feminist movement in Germany, publishing "Die friedfertige Frau" (roughly translating as "the woman ready for peace"), in which she surmised that women were not naturally less aggressive than men, but that they had developed the behavior through conditioning.

For the rest of the girl's life she lived with the River Crow (also called the Sparrowhawks). The precocious girl lied to her Crow captors, telling them she was actually a Crow child who had been previously abducted by the Atsina. Because she could speak some of the Crow language, many of the tribal leaders believed her. They adopted the girl as one of their own and named her Pine Leaf.
As she grew, Pine Leaf convinced her mentors that she would become a better hunter and warrior than a lodge woman. Since she was a good rider and fast learner, they allowed her to follow her desire. Pine Leaf lived her full and eventful life in the Wyoming and Montana territories. About 1828, a black mountain man and trapper named James Beckwourth (a.k.a.

She was the first American lady to become a licensed pilot and the first woman to fly across the English Channel. She was also a movie screenwriter. Even though she died very young, Harriet played a key influence upon the role of women in aviation.
Quimby became interested in aviation about 1910, and, following a visit to an air show at Belmont Park in October of that year, she determined to learn to fly. She took lessons at the Moisant School of Aviation at Hempstead, Long Island, in the spring of 1911, and on August 1 she became the first woman to qualify for a license (number 37) from the Aero Club of America, the U.S. branch of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. She was the second licensed woman pilot in the world, following the baroness de la Roche of France. For a time Quimby flew with the Moisant International Aviators, a demonstration team from the school, but she also continued to contribute articles to various periodicals.

So you need to know your computer would need repair services when they develop both the minor and serious problems. You would not struggle a lot when your computer becomes faulty if you can easily contact experts who are known for quality IT services and computer repair services.
The amount of money and precious time you would save when repairing your defective computer would greatly depend on the computer repair company you choose. People who don’t see the need to hire a good company to work on the computer troubles in good time eventually suffer devastating losses. Because of this, most corporations and businesses hire permanent computer technicians so that they can respond swiftly whenever the unexpected happens. You need to ensure you always work with technicians who are always reliable and efficient in their work.

Some companies, especially larger ones, have IT departments that may or may not have the time or expertise to fix their computers. More often than not, smaller organizations do not have the staff to handle IT problems. Still, both have an extremely affordable option: Outsourcing.
Cost: It is expensive for a company to hire and train people to ‘be ready’ to repair computers in case they should fail. Paying salary and benefits full time when repairs are needed on occasion equals a high cost per repair. If IT personnel are also responsible for keeping network systems operating, do they have the time to drop everything to do a repair? Would it not be more cost effective to outsource the computer repair work and only pay for it when it is needed?
Expertise: If you have heart problems, you don’t go to a foot doctor – you go to a specialist. Outsourcing your computer repair problems to companies that work on them daily allows you to have dedicated specialists working on finding a solution for your problem quickly so you can get back to work faster. Reduced downtime means higher productivity.

I saw a couple of points worth clarifying.
I think it is worth splurging for an SSD, because SSDs are no longer crazy expensive, they improve performance dramatically, and most people really don’t need 56.4 petabytes of storage in their laptop anyway, even if they think they do. My 120-gigabyte SSD in my work laptop still leaves me plenty of space for the work I do, and at home 240 gigs is still plenty for most things.
Wright also states that LCD monitors last 3-5 years. That may be a case of not making them like they used to. We have decade-old monitors at work that are still working, but even if the new ones aren’t as good, that’s still better life expectancy than I got out of CRTs, and they’re a lot cheaper than CRTs were too. Even a $90 LED monitor is luxurious compared to what we put up with in the past, and it’s not hard to find a nice monitor at that price point.

Courts determined that the newspaper's story contained knowingly false, reputation-damaging claims about the author.

According to Dutch newspaper Sp!ts, the woman has been living on a small army-controlled airport the past few months after an embassy worker who was in the region by chance found her carrying a sign saying “I want to go to Amsterdam.” The newspaper did not specify where the woman was found.
The woman had illegally entered Colombia from Venezuela for unknown reasons, the newspaper said in its Friday edition.
According to embassy employee Ronald Barnhoorn, the woman has a history of mental illness.
“When I talked to her on the phone for the first time it took me quite a while to clarify I was not her father,” the official told the newspaper.
“Fortunately the police is taking care of her and giving her food. She’s very timid, but the policemen are very nice,” Barnhoorn said.
A sister of the woman reportedly is preparing to come to Colombia. “We hope she will then go back to the Netherlands,” said the embassy official.

Comics, picture books, biographies, novels etc. I enjoyed all genre, in other words, I simply loved to read. Now, it looks like I have dutifully passed on the genes to my daughter, because I see her with a book most of the time (of course except the school books, which I need to force her to read) But, like me she also loves to read and write her own stories and poems. I am a writer as well and I always tried all possible ways to learn the English language to master better vocabulary. The best way was simply read the newspaper.
So, one Sunday I thought why not make my daughter also cultivate the same habit of improving her vocabulary by reading a newspaper. I told her to get the newspaper and to find what she can read. Alright! With a huge face, she brought it to me and began on the first page. She read a headline of a scam or some terrorist attack, suicidal bomb or something like that. I decided not suitable for her and told her to turn it to the second page and find something else. In the second page, she read a line as a woman was harassed, a man tried to rob and so on.

inspired by my recent 2 weeks in Saskatchewan, I reread Ross’ masterpiece. I first read it as a young girl of 19 and coming back to it so many years later as a mature woman, I’m amazed at how much I missed on that first reading. I savoured each page this time. what a beautiful writer. poetic. he sustains the narrative and yet manages to meditate on place, relationship between man/woman, woman/child, woman/God, woman/herself. equally I’m impressed that he writes convincingly from a woman’s point of view. the only other male writer that I’ve read who managed this, is Brian Moore. I’m thinking of the Passion of Judith Hearne which I am determined to reread again after a few decades.
it’s great to revisit these writers and see if they have withstood the test of time. I was disappointed last year when I reread (or tried) Margaret Lawrence’s The Diviners. something was clunky with it. I think it was the form.

The Inner Council ordered that each homestead owner pay a sum of E50 (about US$4) as contribution towards payment of the services of a prophet called Boy Sithole. The woman was taken before a crowd of residents where she admitted to witchcraft, the newspaper reported.

I would have liked to have stayed at one of the B&Bs in Vicksburg but since we were going to be getting in so late, I didn’t want to have to bother anyone late at night when we would be getting in, especially since I wasn’t sure exactly how late it would be.
This time, we stayed at the Hampton Inn in Vicksburg and used our Hilton Honors points since this particular hotel always seems a little overpriced for a Hampton (I’ve paid less than the $140 this hotel charges on weekends at the Ritz in New Orleans during the December holiday break!). I guess because we used our Hilton Honors points, they bumped us up to the ‘executive level’ and there were snacks in the room and three different drinks in the mini-fridge.

The naturally high acidity found in cool-climate Rieslings balances out the sweetness and creates a wine perfect for food pairing. In Ontario, we produce some great late harvest wines, like the Pelee Island Late Harvest Riesling.
The Pelee Island Late Harvest Riesling is a semi-sweet, crisp and aromatic wine. It has fresh orchard aromas of green apple and pear that carry through onto the palate. The honeyed flavours are balanced with the high acidity in this wine. The Late Harvest Riesling will pair nicely with spicy foods.

Non-fiction reading is a critical part of your child’s reading development. It is important that children are given a variety of books to read, including a balance of fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction books are organized differently than fiction books and are read for a different purpose: to learn new information.

This is really important when you are helping your child to learn the sounds. Just remember not to add an uh to the end of the consonant sounds – so say mmm not muh, lll not luh, etc. because then later it’s easier to blend the sounds together to make words.

Encourage your child to make a link between the sound and the written letter shape. Start with the sounds in your child’s name and then look out for them in signs. The sound m in McDonalds is always a good starting point too!

The human brain is wired for language (Chomsky, Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, 1955, 75), but language acquisition does not happen without models, the way motor development does. It must be nurtured through contact with human language models. Children who do not receive models of language in early childhood will have varying deficiencies of language later in life.
Spoken language develops both spontaneously and subconsciously. A 2-year old couldn't be taught sentence structure and grammar rules now matter how hard someone might try. As Maria Montessori said, "The only language men ever speak perfectly is the one they learn in babyhood, when no one can teach them anything!" Reading is different. It must be actively taught and consciously learned. If it's not actively taught, then even a life spent surrounded by the printed word will not teach someone who is illiterate how to read.
When a middle aged person finally admits that they don't know how to read, they must start at the beginning just like a child does, learning sounds and sounding out words.

A child learning a nursery rhyme will basically learn the structures and language patterns of English. When they learn the rhythm of language, they may also develop a sense of poetry. Before the children will be able to understand the meaning of the statement, they will have to repeatedly hear the statement as well.

Nothing prepares a child to read more than being read to. Picture books contain words that children don't often hear in everyday conversation. Cuddle up with your baby or child and read a good book today!
Reading and writing are learned at the same time! Give your child a chance to draw with different tools and tell stories of their own. They'll learn words have meaning!
Talk to your children every day and let them join in. When children watch, listen and participate, they're learning how to communicate and what words mean.
Songs break down words into individual syllables and allow children to experience rhythm. When children sing, they're learning new vocabulary words, too.
Children learn language and how the world works at playtime. When they dress up, they're learning about different roles in society, problem solving, storytelling, how to act out real situations, put thoughts into words and think symbolically.
Storytelling leads to stronger readers! A child needs to understand what they're reading and how stories progress. Narrate your day, label their actions, tell stories about your childhood and ask open-ended questions.
Reading involves breaking down words into smaller sounds. Sing songs or read nursery

Most parents of young children will have heard the term ‘phonics’ and be aware that they have something to do with letters and words.
Phonics is a well-used method of teaching children to read. The system teaches children to read letters the way they sound so that they can use them to put words together. For example, the word ‘man’ would be spelled ‘em-ay-en’ by an adult, while a child using phonics would spell the word ‘mm-ah-nn’. This method makes it easier for children to put words together and learn to read.
Once children have learned the sounds that each letter makes, they will move on to start forming words from left to right. They’ll also be taught about special relationships between letters that join together to form another sound. These include ‘oo’, ‘ch’, th’ and ‘sh’.
Research has shown that phonics is the most effective way to teach young children aged between five and seven to read. Children start out with easier letters and sounds before progressing on to the more complicated ones. Once the basics have been mastered then children can use phonics to read alone, sounding out words they’re unsure of.
Teaching phonics benefits from children getting plenty of practice in an enjoyable way. Parents can help greatly with this by spending time looking at books with their children. Ask the child to read the book to you or as you’re reading pick out certain words you think your child will be able to manage, even if they

Dual Language Teachers are specially trained to make information meaningful through the use of visuals, objects, gestures, and specialized instructional strategies. In addition, one advantage of having a classroom with both native English- and native Spanish-speakers is that they help each other understand, which also encourages their social interaction. Children are not discouraged from speaking English to communicate, but they are encouraged to speak Spanish as they learn.
Will learning a second language interfere with my child’s ability to learn basic reading, writing and math skills?
No. National studies have shown that children in Dual Language programs, as a group, perform the same or better than their monolingual, English-speaking peers on achievement tests in math, reading and writing (Thomas & Collier, 2001). Research also shows that students who acquire advanced levels of proficiency in two languages often experience cognitive and linguistic advantages and perform better on tasks that require divergent thinking, pattern recognition, and problem solving (Cummins, 1998).
No. Continuous exposure to English at home is also important. Read to your child daily and continue the literacy experiences you would naturally encourage. One of the advantages of this program is that students with strong English abilities succeed well. You may even notice your child beginning to read in English by using the literacy skills learned in Spanish before formal English reading instruction is presented.

It is a common belief that once a child has learned letter names and their corresponding sounds that he must be ready to learn to read. This can be true, but not always. There are many, many more signs we can refer to when trying to determine reading readiness.
Let me start by sharing that reading readiness isn’t just about literacy skills. Reading readiness actually covers a set of competencies that are often forgotten about when considering if reading should be the next step of instruction.
Social Development – Social development is important to reading because children need to know how to take turns, cooperate, and develop self-control before learning to read. This is because a large part of reading instruction involves activities and short discussions where a child needs to have such skills.
Emotional Development – Before learning to read, children need to have a good self-concept and an understanding of how they fit into their world.
Cognitive Development – In the case of reading readiness, children need to have a cognitive level where they can both visually and auditorily discriminate between letter shapes and different letter sounds. Visual discrimination includes the ability to see likeness and differences among letter, such as being able to differentiate between the letters L and T, a and o, or 6 and 9. Auditory discrimination means that a child can hear the difference between /f/ and /v/ sounds, or they can hear the difference in ending in the

For those of us living with our significant other it can often feel as if the only alone time we get alone is while we are in the bathroom. But, if you are in a relationship where you are actually ok with sharing that bathroom time, consider showering with your parter.
Not only is this a fantastic way to get close with your beloved, but it is a great way to conserve the amount of water you use. Plus, you use less energy heating your water, thus saving money on your energy consumption.
The skeptic would say that showering two at a time takes longer and may end up using the same amount of energy, but I can tell you from experience that it does not. In fact, I end up spending less time in there because I don't just sit under the running hot water meditating. If I did that, the my girlfriend (being out of the hot water) would get cold. And nobody wants a cold girlfriend.
So by showering together, we conserve double the amount of water and energy we would have used had we showered individually and we get to spend some more quality time together. Pretty cool that by taking showers with our beloveds we can help conserve the Earth's resources.

Morgan County resident John Peterson will chair the committee, said Glen R. Stotler, commission president.
Peterson did not attend the meeting and did not provide a list of advisory committee members to the commission.
In Peterson's absence, Stotler and Commissioner Thomas R. Swaim culled a list from memory of those who voiced an interest in energy efficiency, and then appointed Peterson, Mike McKechnie, Rebecca MacLeod, Scott Wachter, Sam Ashelman and Larry Robinson to serve on the courthouse energy advisory committee.
"The advisory committee needs to be prepared to make recommendations and options with costs," Stotler said. Tom Potts of the architectural firm Silling & Silling will be back to talk to the commissioners in about three weeks, he said.
The Morgan County Courthouse was destroyed by an August 2006 fire, and the county government offices have been in trailers set up in the courthouse parking lot. The estimated cost for the new courthouse building is about $13 million. Funding has not yet been finalized.
On Monday, McKechnie said, "I would like to see an energy-efficient design that utilizes renewable energy building processes in the new courthouse. The citizens of Morgan County are interested in a project that will conserve energy and use green building products that are environmentally friendly, cost-effective and readily available.

We have a bit of a mystery on our hands: somehow, we are burning about twice as much electricity up here in the mountains than we were down in Georgia–and that’s without air conditioning.
Now granted, we have an electric water heater instead of gas, and our stove top is electric as well. But this house, as I’ve noted before, is quite a bit smaller, and with no AC running, I did not expect to see that we were averaging 77 KWh per day!

But cooling a high-density data center and conditioning sophisticated laboratories without using a lot of energy is very challenging. Integral Group assisted NREL throughout design development in facing these challenges to create the world’s most energy-efficient data center to date.
We determined that in Colorado’s climate, compressor-free cooling could be used in the ESIF data center year-round. We designed low-approach cooling towers to supply medium-temperature (71°F) chilled water to the server rooms. The medium-temperature water cools both the high performance computing (HPC) system and the rest of the servers in the data center, eliminating the need for expensive and failure-prone chillers.
In the data center, Integral Group designed rear-door heat exchangers to cool the servers. These cooling coils trap the hot air exhausted by the servers and immediately cool it with the medium-temperature chilled water. As a result of this careful design, the ESIF data center operates at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.06.
ESIF’s office and laboratory areas were also designed to conserve energy as well. A moderate window-to-wall ratio, increased floor and roof insulation, and triple-element windows improve the Facility’s insulation value, and contribute to the thermal comfort of NREL’s employees. Additionally, the heat that is generated by the HPC is harvested and used to heat the offices and labs, reducing the heat load for the facility.

Rumors first started circulating that a new woman was in 45-year-old Duhamel’s life in March, but the couple seemed to keep their courtship under wraps for months. Nevertheless, reports soon began surfacing that a fiery love affair had begun.
"Their relationship seems to get stronger every day," a source told ET on June 11, just days after they went on their first public date in Beverly Hills, California.
"When they are together, you can truly see how taken they are by each other,” the source added at the time. “They're sweet and affectionate with one another and laugh nonstop. It's great to see Josh so happy."
Then, in early July, the happy couple was spotted enjoying a romantic getaway together on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. There, the 28-year-old actress was spied kissing her boyfriend as the pair prepared for a scenic boat ride. This recent PDA just makes today’s revelation all the more surprising.

Here are some thoughts from the beach on the Outer Banks last week... 1. When reading and floating in the pool it is best to read advance reading copies. They are paperbacks in a size easy to hold. Hardcovers WILL get wet and manuscripts have too many free floating pages to be near water. Thus it's ARCs in the pool, hardbacks on the couch and manuscripts in the car (where the pages can get stuffed between the seats after you read them).

While “everybody” went to the pool, the part of the pool they enjoyed or spent their time was different.

A process that takes about 7 hours, for a little over 9756 gallons. John and the guys got it right first time. The jets work perfectly. The nozzle end is adjustable for water flow and the little knob on the deck controls the amount of air coming into the jet. Togther they make an enjoyable combination.

When I arrived to Philippines in the middle of the night and after two stops and 21hours of flight, I began to wonder where I was going to spend the night. As I do not really plan when traveling alone, I sat at the airport to check out my “Lonely Planet”. Should I sleep here or should I go back to one of the 7100 islands of the archipelago?

My divert field was VFR, so I cancelled IFR and tuned the CTAF. I was number two for the airport until a bizjet called in on an umpteen-mile final and the guy in front decided to let him go first. Once I finally landed, I discovered a pleasant, well-equipped FBO and settled in to wait for the destination’s weather to improve.
Checking weather from the FBO lounge, it soon became clear the storm over my destination was moving off as it dissipated. But it also became clear it was moving toward my divert field. Wunnerful.
Another pilot, the guy who landed in front of me, was there for the same basic reason, so we introduced ourselves and swapped war stories. But I was growing restless. Soon, night had fallen, adding another element to planning my final leg home.

Everton, West Ham, Lyon and Marseille have all been linked with £25m-rated Les Bleus international.
"It's a determined no," says Wenger when asked if Giroud could still leave before the deadline.
Arsene Wenger has confirmed that he gave Olivier Giroud the chance to leave Arsenal this summer, but the powerful striker decided to stay put despite rumoured interest from a number of suitors including Everton.
Giroud proved to be the hero of the opening night of the 2017-18 Premier League season on Friday (11 August), demonstrating trademark strength to hold off centre-backs Harry Maguire and Wes Morgan to head home the winning goal in a thrilling 4-3 home defeat of plucky Leicester City.
Such an effort provoked scenes of sheer jubilation at the Emirates Stadium and came just two minutes after fellow substitute Aaron Ramsey looked to have rescued a point for the inconsistent Gunners after blasting in from close range.
Giroud's Arsenal future had been subject to considerable doubt after five years, with the £46.5m ($60.4m) club-record signing of Alexandre Lacazette expected to restrict his starting opportunities even further.
Ronald Koeman's Everton have been most heavily mentioned in connection with the £25m-rated 30-year-old, with the likes of West Ham United, Marseille and Lyon also credited with an interest.
However, Wenger insists that Giroud will remain in north London beyond the end of the transfer window despite being given the opportunity to move on and seek more regular football elsewhere.

After checking out various options in Spangmik, we arrived at Padma Home Stay. Since their rooms did not have attached toilet, so we decided to stay at their tents.
Situated only a short distance away from the lake, there were no tents or buildings between their tents and the lake. Hence unlike the other places we had checked out earlier, we had an unrestricted view of the Pangong Tso, of which we took full advantage of the next morning.
The tents themselves were fairly basic and each tent had 3 beds (a double bed and a separate single bed) along with the attached toilet.
Since the concrete structure on which the tents were made was built on a slope, it wasn’t properly leveled and was instead slanted. Due to it, be it the bed or the toilet, everything was slanted and that made sleeping on the bed a little comfortable. Then again, another luxury tent costing Rs. 2,500 I had seen a few minutes ago had a similar issue and the view from there was pretty bad.
The other issue was that their toilet seat was quite low, so you were actually squatting on it rather than sitting. However, there was running water and we did get hot water in a bucket early in the morning.

After returning home, getting married and having two children, I finally decided to use that inspiration. A workshop with a local jeweller and a night course gave me the basics and the oomph to launch Sage and Mac Jewellery.
I feel jewellery can help the wearer express who they are... Whether it be a stay at home super mumma (i know first hand how you can lose your identity in the chaos that is motherhood) or a working warrior woman ... or both, I want to help these modern day heroines show a little of their personality, express their inner goddesses and most of all have fun by wearing Sage and Mac Jewellery.

The Polynesian Village Resort at Walt Disney World is an old favorite of mine, and the hotel has been seeing a lot of design changes recently which I was excited to see on our recent trip. This week we're going to be taking a look at some of the new stuff, and we're starting at Captain Cook's!
Captain Cook's is the quick service restaurant at the Polynesian Village Resort. They have some delicious items on the menu (that grown-up grilled cheese...and those crispy chips...), but today we're focusing on a feast for the eyes - the new decor!
When Captain Cook's got its recent refurb, the layout was left largely unchanged. The main difference is that the self-order screens are gone. I'm really going to miss them! It was nice to punch in selections yourself while you mulled over choices, and the graphics made you feel like you were in a tropical jungle. Now you give your order to a cast member at the podium.
The cupcakes, in case you were wondering (I always wonder about the cupcakes), are in the refrigerated case these days. They seem less fresh when they're served this way, but they do still have Mickey and Minnie!
My favorite addition to Captain Cook's: the POSTERS! The walls are covered with fabulous retro art featuring the "magical islands" that the Polynesian Village's longhouses are named after.

Retrieved Text: Captain Cook is generally acknowledged as the first great European scientific explorer. Despite his ordinary roots, he rose through the ranks to become a remarkable officer. On May 27, 1768, Cook, then just a Royal Naval lieutenant, took command of HM bark Endeavour. Its voyage of exploration to the Pacific would last almost three years, record thousands of miles of uncharted lands and seas--including New Zealand, the east coast of Australia and many Pacific islands--and test all Cook's skills as a navigator, seaman and leader. Cook's three voyages were among the first to take civilian scientists, notably Sir Joseph Banks, and they would reveal to European eyes the lands, peoples, flora and fauna of the Pacific as never before, heralding a period of great change for the region. His voyages would also set new standards for scientific enquiry and exploration.
But while the figure of Cook understandably dominates the story of 18th-century Pacific exploration, his fame has often shadowed those who followed him on many voyages of science and exploration into the Pacific, depriving these explorers of the greater attention they deserve. Correcting this imbalance, Pacific Encounters reveals the European voyages that continued Cook's work not only of charting but also starting to exploit and control the Pacific. These voyages, by William Bligh, George Vancouver, Matthew Flinders, Malaspina, Lap rouse and Arthur Phillip, span a period that saw Britain becoming the world's leading maritime power, a situation well in place by the time that Charles Darwin's voyage in Fitzroy's Beagle laid the basis of even greater understanding

In this study, Cook's Index predicted impossible values for several counties that together contained a clear majority of New York State citizens. Cook's Index was also shown to be unreliable across types of counties. Rural and Urban counties had significantly different ratios of Cook's Index to Pistol Permits in New York. The models show a general finding that the relationship between Cook's Index and legitimate firearm ownership varies depending on the Rural-Urban Continuum. A more precise and non-linear model is needed to estimate the prevalence of firearms. Finally, the way in which Rural and Urban culture affect the use of firearms needs further research.

Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18, and her boyfriend Jay Cook, 20, were found dead near Seattle in November 1987.
Police in Snohomish County, Wash., said Friday they arrested William Earl Talbott, 55, from the Seattle-Tacoma area and he has been booked on one count of first-degree murder in the death of Van Cuylenborg.
Officers said they expect to charge the man with Cook's murder once the investigation into additional evidence is finished.
The high school sweethearts were on their way to Seattle by ferry to pick up furnace parts for Cook's father when they disappeared. Their bodies were found in separate locations outside the city days later.
Skagit County Sheriff Will Reichardt said the work detectives did in 1987 documenting the case and storing evidence led them to the arrest.
"It's been 31 years since this horrific crime took place, today we are one step closer for justice for Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg," he told a news conference.
Talbott was expected to appear for a first court appearance in the Skagit County justice centre on Friday.
Police said DNA collected at the scene of Van Cuylenborg's murder was used to identify Talbott's ancestors, which then led them to him. Officers say once genealogists made the connection, police acquired a DNA sample from a cup Talbott had used.

The soon-to-be legendary (if true) story was skeptically reported by Mashable writing it was “next to impossible to verify” after picking it up from Russian newspaper Khasanskiye Vesti on Tuesday. The story goes as follows. The Russian man was drinking with his friends when he “dropped dead” according to the paper and was taken to the morgue by paramedics once his friends called the police. From there Detective Alexey Stoev says the man “resurrected.” Still drunk the man woke up confused in the “dark” and “cold” room, finding a corpse nearby sending him running for the door. After realizing it was locked the man reportedly banged on it, getting the attention of a female morgue employee who was so scared she called police instead of opening. When police came they found the man and released him.

He was very frail, probably about 110 pounds. He was never that hale and hearty. So he saw these big birds, and when he saw them he fainted out of fright.

Why should a man who takes blood from animals daily be upset by being on the receiving end of a procedure he knows well?

This Roadmaster wagon can be pushed or pulled and can be used as more than just a child's plaything. It is handy for transporting heavy loads around your property and away from home. Use the wagon to move boxes, books, groceries, a picnic and more from one place to the other with ease. It also makes moving children though a park or other outdoor area more convenient.
Price: $70.00 as it is gently used from photo sessions. All in working condition, see pics.

I kept that wagon for a few more years. I knew that I had outgrown it but the wagon was mine and I loved it and I didn’t want to give it up.

You might be wondering why I just regaled you with a story about a red wagon in an article about Pokemon but consider this, what happens if the wagon were the Pokemon series?
It’s been very wild to watch adults speak about Pokemon as though it is for them. They have even gone so far as to review bomb the Let’s Go games over on Metacritic. It’s a game about 10 year olds running around without parental supervision doing the fantasy equivalent of dog fighting with none of the grim dark elements that probably should accompany such a narrative. It’s a game modeled after a children’s cartoon modeled after a game.
Pokemon Blue & Red came out then the Pokemon anime created was based off of B&R then Yellow version came out and was based on the anime.
From the merchandising to the creative direction in the games themselves it seems quite obvious that Pokemon is meant for children. There’s a stronger case for this considering that many of the adult fans of Pokemon grew up with it. But there’s a group

My friends and I pulled each other in it. We pushed each other in it. We loaded it up and went on numerous adventures.

Cargo capacity is very good, the CVT transmission works great, including when towing. Handling is great, gas mileage has been 28-29 mph, combined city/highway.

The bottom line on the Outback is all wheel drive wagon for 30 mpg. The ground clearance is very high for a car which makes it comfortable to get in and out of. Avoid the light colored cloth interiors as it soaks up every stain possible. The CVT takes some getting used to. There is a delay engaging the transmission from reverse into drive and on a hill it can roll backwards like a manual transmission but otherwise the CVT is great for MPG. At highway speeds a typical trans will downshift and slow you down but this CVT just coasts saving fuel but again takes some getting used to not to rear end the car in front of you. The handling is not as "tight" as you would expect with an AWD. This is no BMW on corners.

One of the things I've discovered (two excellent resources are here and here) is that while the brakes on my model coal wagon worked so well that the wheels wouldn't turn, in real life they wouldn't have worked at all, as I fitted them the wrong way around.
By the late 19th century most wagons were fitted with a simple lever brake on one side only. The diagram shows the break lever (in red) in the off position. To apply the brake the lever was pushed down. This turns the shaft (blue) and connecting arm (green) clockwise, which in turn moves the two push rods and attached brake shoes (black) outwards and onto the wheels. As you can see this is a really simple, but effective, braking system. The one downside being that if you had to apply a brake to a run away wagon you might have to cross the track to get to it, which may well be bad for your health and well being!
The easiest way to solve this problem is to simply fit a completely independent brake system to the other side of the wagon, but with the brake lever always at the right hand end of the wagon (so it appears to always be in the same place no matter which side you view the wagon from).

Police said the men were arguing and pushed each other before Baldwin, 60, got more aggressive. The driver of the station wagon told police Baldwin hit him with his hand, but wasn't sure if it was a punch or a slap.

Baldwin was released from a nearby precinct in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighbourhood about two hours after the incident. He was ordered to appear in court 26 November.

At a loose end and in the area I found myself with a spare hour and had a blustery walk around.
Healey Mills opened in 1963 in attempt to modernise wagon-load traffic. It replaced a dozen smaller yards in the area and its purpose was to improve the efficiency of sorting and marshalling wagons into trains before sending them off to their destination. The yards featured hump-shunting, in which wagons were pushed over a ‘hump’, freewheeled into the required siding, and braked using special retarders next to the rails - all controlled from a centralised operations tower.
A purpose-built diesel depot opened alongside the yards at the end of 1966 and the two facilities saw round the clock activity with a claimed capacity of 4,000 wagons per day. Situated to the west of Wakefield, Healey Mills was ideally located for sending and receiving trains to all parts of the country, as well as handling the large number of local coal trains at the time.
But wagon-load railfreight came under increasing threat in the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from road transport. Then a double blow came with the decline of the Yorkshire coal industry and resultant reduction in coal trains, which had once formed up to 50 percent of traffic at Healey Mills.
As a result, the depot lost its own allocation of locomotives in 1984 and the marshalling yards closed in 1987 - although both were still used for stabling locomotives and trains

The woman was detained at the same address in Tipton as a 19-year-old London man who is being questioned about the killing.
Police yesterday continued to search a property in the Tipton area where the woman was arrested and the 19-yearold man were arrested on Wednesday afternoon.
The officer leading the inquiry into the murder said yesterday that "good progress" was being made.
Det Supt Mark Warwick of Thames Valley police said three men were being questioned in connection with the killing of 16-year-old Mary-Ann, who was sexually abused and beaten before being stabbed in the neck and dumped in a park in Reading, Berkshire.
Mr Warwick said Reading magistrates had given detectives a warrant to continue holding a 21-year-old man arrested Tuesday lunchtime in London until the weekend.
The two other murder suspects were arrested in London and Tipton within a hour of each other on Wednesday afternoon. The woman was detained on suspicion of harbouring an offender.
Mr Warwick said hundreds of hours of CCTV footage were being examined by forensic teams in a bid to trace the movements of a gang of up to six men who kidnapped Mary-Ann and her 18-year-old friend late last Friday night.

I remember how much I wanted to get my period when I was younger. It seemed like the approving stamp of womanhood. . .I quickly realized that being a woman is not all it's cracked up to be.
Besides the sometimes incapacitating cramps, the mood swings are at the top of my personal 'hate' list. I severely dislike being in a bad mood for no good reason. Ending or beginning your day in a fit of rage or a pool of tears is not anyone’s idea of a good time.
In order to quell the cramping pain, and calm your nerves, you must understand why you're experiencing them.

Variety says the story, which takes place during the London Blitz, revolves around a man and woman enduring a cold marriage until the wife falls for one of her husband's dear friends, a writer played by Fiennes. The writer and the woman have a very steamy albeit brief affair, which she ends abruptly. The lover later discovers that the woman has made a pact with God that if the Almighty spares her lover from a particularly bad bombing raid, she would agree never to see him again.

The British actor will play all three leads in the movie about a Jewish family's struggle to maintain its identity over three generations. He will play a pragmatic lawyer, his Olympic-athlete son and his political grandson.
"It was one of the best scripts I have ever read in my life," Fiennes said Monday.
Acclaimed Hungarian director Istvan Szabo is directing and also wrote the script. The movie is due out in the spring.

Have you ever thought about why this is? how is it that your mood affects others and others moods can affect ours? Did you know that all thoughts have a vibrational frequency and when you are on the same frequency as someone else you will tend to get along great.
Have you ever met someone who you just clicked with immediately? It almost seemed like you had known this person for a while as they were just so easy to talk to. This is because both of your thoughts were on the same vibrational frequency.
So when someone is in a bad mood and we are not. We can just sort of let them bounce off of us and our mood will not be affected. If we start letting what they are saying affect us, such as becoming irritated or if we disagree with them we will start to lower our own vibration.
We do not even have to say a word to them. If we identify with their feelings at all then we have let our own vibration lower and so their

Typically when someone is in a bad mood, it does not improve the situation to directly tell them. Instead, subtle feedback may be better. We created the concept of alerting people they were in a bad mood by using an ambient display. “Bad mood” could be detected in a few ways, such as volume (raised voice) or accelerometers (banging things or treating them roughly). We suggested objects that detected they were being treated badly could glow red, like raw skin. This also has the side benefit of the objects informing users subtly when they are being used incorrectly.

The title character/narrator of this book, Travice Ames, is another one-of-a-kind event in the Doc Savage series. This is a first-person story told by a woman. Dent was really experimenting with this set of first-person Doc tales and though the mysteries are not great, these stories are truly growing in importance to me simply because of their amazing literary experimentation. Dent was a truly gifted and versatile writer to do this month after month, year after year, and have so much success.
The Ames character is, in a skewed way, very similar to the narrators of the first two novels in this Omnibus #5. She is as manipulative and unethical as The Monkey Suit’ Henry, but as go-getting and self-determined as Sammy in No Light to Die By. So we love/hate her depending on her mood and actions.
The main problem with this story is that it is very slow to develop. This wouldn’t be an issue with a longer novel, but this is one of the later, shorter adventures, so when the initial action develops for 5 chapters and then the narrator finally decided in desperation to go to Doc in chapter 6, well, you see what I mean.

The study, published in Personality and Individual Differences, found that bad moods can actually lead to better organisation skills and focus, or ‘executive function’ – and good moods can actually dampen them.
Researchers from the University of Waterloo looked at a group of 95 participants and studied how they coped with a series of tests depending on their mood, as well as answering a questionnaire on their emotional reactivity and mood during the test period.
The group was broken down into two categories based on emotional reactivity – high-reactive (extroverts) and low-reactive people (introverts).
Their findings did however only apply to extraverts, whereas they say introverts ground to a halt when they’re in a bad mood.
“Our results show that there are some people for whom a bad mood may actually hone the kind of thinking skills that are important for everyday life,” one of the study’s co-authors, psychology professor Tara McAuley, said in a statement.
“We know that emotional reactivity differs from person to person starting at a very early age and that these individual differences have implications for mental health later in development,” added McAuley.

One of his renowned disciples was Chan Wah Shun, who in taught the system to Yip Man, who is considered the Grand Master of modern Ving Tsun. In 1949, Yip Man brought the style out of Fatshan, China to Hong Kong and eventually, through his disciples, to the rest of the world. In recent times, the greatest Master of the Ving Tsun system was the late Grandmaster Moy Yat, who was Yip Man's closest disciple for 15 years.
The Ving Tsun Kung Fu Clan now has the largest following in Hong Kong. The once little known style has become one of the most popular martial arts in the world today.
Since the death of Yip Man in 1972, there have been many who have tried to fill the void left by his absence. Where once there was only one ving tsun family, now there are many systems, each looking a little different from the rest, with most claiming to be "authentic" ving tsun (Wingtsun, Wing Chun, Weng Chun).

The book is further concerned with an artistic form through which man's behavior is best understood. In this regard, the ubiquitous use of imagery is intended to throw light on man's interaction with nature in the context of both the static (physical features and forces) and changing dynamics beyond man's control. Above all, it is also generally about how little winds of events, subtle warning whistles blowing in them, matter and lead to ultimate storms that may have been averted. From whatever angle life is viewed, man's resilience is dealt with rather implicitly in terms of how he deals with death, the height of man's gloom, and other tragic events, invariably evolving and transformed into man's cycles of hilarious and victorious moods.

The report also noted that there were weapons in the home about four blocks from Witter Field baseball park.
When police entered the man's home with family members, they smelled a strong odor of natural gas and found three bodies, all of which had suffered gunshot wounds. They concluded that it likely was a double-murder and suicide but declined to answer any additional questions about the incident.
Mayor Zach Vruwink said Police Chief Kurt Heuer notified him about the deaths early Wednesday. Vruwink said he knows the 36-year-old man's father through the Elks Club and knows the man's brother.
"They were such a beautiful family and children; that's what touches me the most — that it's taken the lives of children," Vruwink said.
Vruwink said he had met the children's mother several times and they have many friends in common.
"It touches many of the people in the community, without question," Vruwink said.
Rick Vanderhei lives a block away from the scene. He said he walked around the area at 9 a.m. after noticing barricades near his home. Officers told him they couldn't say anything, but he later learned what

Some of the dominant ideas in the novel involve (1) man's isolation, (2) man's relationship to the community, and (3) man's inhumanity to man. Many of these ideas will appear to be negative or pessimistic when viewed from the standpoint of the main character, Joe Christmas. But by focusing on Lena Grove at the beginning, Faulkner is first giving us a brief positive view. While it is true that Lena is now isolated and alone on the road, she almost instinctively knows that people will help her even though, as with Mrs. Armstid, some of them don't approve of her. Also, she will evoke positive and favorable responses from the community and will receive help from many people. In contrast to the bitter harshness which Joe Christmas evokes, Lena inspires kindness and compassion.
Basically, Lena is presented as a simple and relatively uncomplicated person with apparently a great strength and determination. She never complains of her lot and never asks help from anyone even though she willingly accepts assistance. She possesses a simple and basic faith in life. Her responses to life are the fundamental reactions founded on the concept of charity and hope. She believes that she will be with the father of her child when it is born. She is always anxious to help those people who give her assistance, and she would always be obliged if others would share her meager meals with her. This will later be

Manabu Yukawa, the physicist known as 'Detective Galileo', is in Hari Cove to speak at a conference on a planned underwater mining operation, and finds himself drawn into the case. Did the murder have something to do with the fight of the small community to rebuild itself, or does it have its roots in the town's history?

So when the first holiday following Ger's death only heightened his family's grief, ARNI Foundation founder Nikki Linn decided the best gift she could give would be to carry out her half brother's wish.
Instead of exchanging gifts with her family, Linn began planning a trip to help rebuild Haiti, and along the way recruited the support of her friends and community.
Linn is teaming up with the Theophile Outreach Center of Brooklyn, which Andlinger's family designated to receive donations in lieu of flowers after Ger, a Connecticut resident, committed suicide. The nonprofit started its Hope for Haiti program in response to the January 2010 earthquake.
"He was the least likely kid you would think this would happen to," Linn said. "It was so bizarre. I still can't wrap my mind around it."
On April 12, a group of seven people -- including a Daytona Beach firefighter -- will travel to Haiti to help rebuild houses and distribute supplies. But like most of her charitable endeavors, Linn decided that if she was going to make the most impact, she would need to take matters into her own hands.
With the help of her business partner Mike Erthal and donors, she has hired a shipping company to transport a 40-foot container of donated school supplies, food, medical supplies, clothes and toys to Port-au-Prince. The cost alone to ship the container is $4,000. The container can hold 46,000

It is believed to be the first death at the event in six years.
The tragedy comes amid fears that this year's Belfast Marathon will be the last, following news that in the future organisers may have to pay up to £120,000 to cover policing at the event.
The man, who was aged in his 50s and understood to be from Northern Ireland, was rushed to hospital after collapsing around six miles into the race.
It's understood the man was a keen runner but was taking part in what was his first marathon.
He collapsed while running along the Sydenham bypass in east Belfast, close to Victoria Park. Race officials assisted him and also visited the man in hospital, but he later died.
A spokesperson for the event said it was deeply regretful and added that the man's family have requested privacy at this time.
"It was around mile six, which is very early in the race, and we responded very quickly with our first aid teams providing the best care that they could," they said. "He went to hospital but sadly passed away."
The NI Ambulance Service said they received an emergency call at around 9.55am for a man who had collapsed on the Sydenham bypass.
"NIAS were on scene within four minutes having despatched a rapid response paramedic and an A&E crew," he said.

It was reported that Olango, 38, suffered from mental health issues, which may have been exacerbated by the death of his best friend.
According to USA Today, authorities said they released the footage for “the sake of the well-being of the community” given that “the aggression of some of the protesters was escalating to the point where it was necessary, El Cajon Police Chief Jeff Davis said in a press conference on Friday.

As we previously reported, Olango’s sister called police three times to ask for help for her brother who appeared to be having an episode in a California strip mall. After arriving to the scene, police opened fire on the man who they say acted “erratically” and failed to comply with their orders and kept his hands concealed in his pockets while walking back and forth.

One of Ghirlandaio's best-known works, it is considered notable for its emotional poignancy. Its realism has been described as unique among the portraits of the Quattrocento.
The picture portrays an older man in a red robe, embracing a young child who is also wearing red. They sit in an interior, illuminated against a darkened wall. Behind them at right is a window through which can be seen a generalized landscape, its uneven terrain and winding roads typical of Ghirlandaio's backgrounds. Although the man's fur-lined robe and cappuccio and the boy's elegant doublet and cap indicate a noble heritage, and despite the traditional assumption that the subjects are grandfather and grandson, their identities are unknown. It is possible that the painting was commemorative in purpose, and that the child was a narrative invention intended to emphasize the man's beneficence. The poignancy of the image is dramatized by the contrast between the man's weathered and wise face, and the child's delicate profile. While the composition is thematically related to portraiture from the Netherlands, by the mid-15th century the motif of a portrait in an interior with a landscape seen in the distance was common in Italy.
An extraordinary feature of the painting is the deformity of the man's nose, evidence of rhinophyma. Ghirlandaio has presented the portrait in a naturalistic and sympathetic fashion, at variance with physiognomic theory of the era, which maintained a connection

They said it might happen, but i didn’t believe it. It crashed in December, i sent it to HP and it came back with the same hard drive, just a new motherboard. This time, both were new and it was too late.
All my pictures were gone….2 years worth. All my documents, all my saved sites, everything all nicely set the way i like it. Yep, all gone. They sent back a computer that really doesn’t excite me anymore. I have to take time to put everything back on, make it pretty, and it’s just not the same.
I’ve been laying low…in a low state of mind, frustrated, and discouraged. I need a job. But an erased hard drive took it to a whole new low. I’m blah.
Hopefully things will start getting better. People have started calling about babysitting, so that is producing some income. Hopefully enough people will start to call to where i can make it a full-time gig. My dream of working at Coach was shattered when i found out they only pay $8/hr. Who can live on that! Crazy. So it’s down the nanny/babysitting road i go.

Hamburger has not been convicted of a doping offence and the DIF subsequently finds it untenable that agreed-upon Olympic selection demands are to be deviated from on the sole basis of suspicions and circumstantial evidence,” said a DIF statement. Hamburger formally met the selection demands by placing sixth at last year’s Worlds in Hamilton, Canada, and was hugely surprised when the DCU decided not to nominate him for an Olympic place earlier this month. “It feels like I’m fighting an enemy I can’t see. I’m defending myself in a case that isn’t a case,” the Acqua e Sapone rider said at the time. Since then, he has encouraged the Danish sporting authorities to test him at any time, and has furthermore provided the relevant parties with a detailed plan of his whereabouts leading up to the Athens Olympics. Besides Hamburger, procycling columnist Frank Hoj (CSC) and Rabobank’s Michael Rasmussen have qualified for the Olympics.

Under Stan and Darren, Mary headed eastward and franchises opened as far and wide as Fort Lauderdale, Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Washington DC, Phoenix, West Hollywood, Denver Kansas City and Chicago.
Under Stan and Darren, the first efforts were made to come up with common menu items and recipes. But staying true to the spirit of the original Hamburger Mary’s, the new franchisees were given free range to incorporate mismatched dinnerware, colorfully framed artwork (hung in crooked collages), and boldly painted walls. Walking into any Hamburger Mary’s is like walking into Mary’s home, with each location a little unique in its eclectic décor (yet all the same, “very Mary”).
Although the original locations in San Francisco and Hawaii had long closed, by the mid-2000’s Hamburger Mary’s had reached a peak. There were eleven locations nationwide, but many franchisees were

As I was looking around for new printables to illustrate, I made an unfortunate discovery: Just like their namesake cuisine counterparts, all the online hamburger paragraph printables were of poor quality. Cheaply produced clipart illustrations slapped onto Word documents. I decided to mend this problem, by drawing a high-quality hamburger that would actually make your mouth water. Out with the McDonalds, and in with the Long Horn! And now I present to you my creation: Tim’s Printable Hamburger Paragraph Worksheet, sponsored by the kind folks at Dutch Renaissance Press, for your child’s intellectual consumption.
Now you can show you kids and students the layers that make up a strong paragraph. Beginning at the top, we’ve got the topic sentence / top bun. This is the main message of the paragraph. Next we have the supporting sentences, represented on the hamburger by the tasty topping: lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions, bacon (Mmmm….Bacon). Then, to wrap it all up, we conclude with a conclusion sentence that connects the supporting details with the topic sentence, visually shown by the hamburger’s bottom bun.

I left the egg yolk off and they turned out perfectly fine. Without the egg yolk, all you need to do is use vegan margarine instead of the butter, and soy milk instead of regular milk to have a vegan version. Easy!
The rolls were soft like regular hamburger buns but they also had some of the chewy texture of bread. They were delicious and held up well with all of the messy condiments. Dave has to have everything on his burger--mustard, ketchup, vegan mayo, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes--so store bought buns usually disintegrate. This buns were nice and sturdy but also soft and puffy. I'd love to make them again.

Pietermaritzburg (SA): Reliving history, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today retraced Mahatma Gandhi’s train journey in South Africa as he travelled to a railway station where Gandhi was thrown out of a train compartment that proved to be a turning point in his life.
On the second day of his visit to South Africa, Modi boarded a train at Pentrich and travelled to Pietermaritzburg, a distance of around 15 km, paying tribute to Gandhi’s fight against racial discrimination.
On 7 June 1893, while Gandhi was on his way to Pretoria from Durban, a white man objected to his presence in a first-class carriage, and he was ordered to move to the third- class compartment.
Gandhi had a valid first-class ticket and refused to obey the orders following which he was thrown out of the train at Pietermaritzburg station in a winter night.
He had stayed at the station that night in shivering cold and the bitter incident had played a major role in Gandhi’s decision to stay on in South Africa and fight the racial discrimination against Indians there.

The members of the association kept each other informed about their ships via the Trintella Journal; e.g. A Trintella 38 that competed in the OSTAR, the victory of a Trintella 42 in the Corpus Christi Race Week in Texas and also of a Trintella 42 participating in the Azoren race. Those who returned from a circumnavigation were welcomed home. The association has a Magazine, published twice a year, written in Dutch, partly translated in English and German.

The architecture has kept its historical design, while it was fully modernised and comparing Tainan to Taipei, Tainan seems to like to keep the slow piece of life with history and does not hurry for any big changes. As I was wandering around the town, I came across a sizeable green pumpkin that looked like a fruit with pistachio coloured skin, it had juicy flesh – similar texture to a watermelon – commonly known as a winter melon.

It tasted amazingly nutty with brown sugar deep flavours. There were several different winter melon tea variations based on amount of tea and type of sugar used in the drink.

To locate the source of a leak it’s always best to start with a dry area, if at all possible. After removing the sink cabinet contents, I thoroughly wiped the water supply lines and the inside of the cabinet dry with a towel. There was also a tiny bit of mold forming so I wiped it off using a mold remover. Starting with a dry area allows you to easily see new drips.
I turned on the cold water tap and let the water run for about a minute. No leak. Next I tried the hot water tap. Ah hah – there it was!
I turned off the hot water tap, and with a dry paper towel, wiped off the current drips, then turned the hot water tap on again to see exactly where it was leaking from. My first thought was that the water was leaking at one of the connections between the faucet, the water softner and the water supply lines. As it turned out that wasn’t the case.
Upon closer inspection, the drips appeared to be coming from within the kitchen faucet itself. Like many people, I turned to the web for repair help, but the only leak repair instructions to be found were for dripping spouts or leaks at the base of the spout. My kitchen

The cold water faucet or valve must be turned on and fully open. Check the household faucet to see if the cold water faucet is turned on. Make sure to completely open the faucet for proper fill.
Check for any kinks in inlet hose, which can restrict water flow. If the inlet hose is kinked, it will get no water at all because there is only one inlet hose on this washer.
Replace inlet hose after 5 years of use to reduce the risk of hose failure. Periodically inspect and replace inlet hose if bulges, kinks, cuts, wear, or leaks are found.
There is an inlet valve on the back of your washer where the water inlet hose connects. On the inside of the valve, there is a screen to keep water contaminants from entering your washer. Depending on your water hardness, that screen can become clogged with sediment over time. This will cause the machine to fill slowly.
Check that inlet valve screen has not become clogged.
Whirlpool recommends that appliances be directly connected to the water supply for optimum machine performance. Using anti-flood devices can reduce the water pressure and amount of water entering the appliance.

The LED faucet can add beauty to almost any sink and is activated through water pressure with the ability to turn off automatically. In addition, a light alert is there for telling the water temperature. The light will turn a red color from blue when the water temperature rises above 40 degrees centigrade.

Most of us know the winter drill: run the faucet to protect the pipes. While seemingly obvious to many, taking this preventive step can really save the home owners expensive water damage costs.
Allow a slow drip to reduce pressure. It doesn’t matter how fast the drip is, the slower the drip, the less water wasted.
It is crucial to run hot and cold water on multiple faucets. Also, let warm water drip overnight, preferably from a faucet on an outside wall.
Don’t neglect to run the faucets in colder and more vulnerable areas of the home.
Don’t turn off the faucet even if the dripping stops. Ensure to keep your faucet turned on overnight regularly, as a safeguard measure.
Make sure to drip your faucets regularly this winter! For further information on frozen pipes and their devastating consequences, take a look at our most recent blog post, “Avoiding Frozen Pipes this Cold Season – Are You at Risk?” .

A faucet compression valve uses a stem that rotates when you turn the faucet handle. When you rotate the handle counterclockwise, the washer attached to the end of the stem compresses against the valve seat inside the faucet body, shutting off the supply of water to the shower head. Over time, the shower valve seat becomes worn, and the water cannot be turned off completely. Replacing the worn valve seat repairs the shower faucet and stops the flow of water.
Turn off the shower water supply valve to the faucet if you can access it. You can also turn off the water supply where it comes into your home, or turn off the water at the meter box if you cannot access the shower’s supply valve.
Slip the blade of a small flat-head screwdriver in the small spot along the edge of the faucet handle button. Use the screwdriver to pop the button off the handle and expose the screw.

The bell made a brief comeback and chimed on November 11, and 12, 2018 to mark Armistice Day centenary commemorations.

The dates of the founding of the Treble Bell (1936) for King George VI’s 1937 coronation, described in the 1936 inventory don’t seem to add up, but that’s what is apparently written!
Thus I don’t know why the final note in the 1936 inventory should refer to the “5th Tenor” as this bell is now clearly the 6th Tenor, founded in 1737, but I suppose it is quite likely that at this stage the tower had only 5 bells (as some towers still do) - shown in the inventory as 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th and that a Treble was added in 1936, such that the “5th Tenor” became the 6th Tenor. The fact that bells 2-6 are all much older might support this theory.
It is also worth mentioning that for much of this time, the bell ropes would have descended to, and the bells been rung from, ground level rather than from up in the clock/ringing chamber. There are closed-in holes in the floor of this clock/ringing chamber to show this and, as further evidence of the theory above, there are only five bell rope holes.

Victorian England though still lacked an accurate timepiece that could be referred to throughout the Empire. Indeed, even in Britain time itself was very subjective, if it was 11am in London it was 11:20am in Manchester, no standard time existed and no rules governed accuracy.
In 1871 when Edward J. Dent constructed the Standard Clock, a sidereel regulator, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, he shipped over from Venice a large number on of the parts he required for such an accurate timepiece. Amongst the shipment was a long case clock called a Spocken Regulator valued for its high tension balance springs key to Dent’s super accurate timepiece that was destined to become the standard G.M.T and key to the synchronising of the British Empire at the time.
As Dent began work on his clock and sorting through his various shipments he noticed that the crate of the Spocken Regulator had a hole on one side, quite unusual and he feared that his precious springs may have been damaged but upon emptying out its contents everything appeared to be in order. Upon opening the Spocken Regulators front case though Dent’s blood ran cold, at the bottom of the case was a small pile of empty monkey nut shells, Dent had inadvertently imported a Horological nightmare, Pendulum Pandas.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. But it's best not to go getting ideas.
We go to a few museums that look, in Sarah's immortal phrase, "like the contents of some babushka's attic." The antique clocks and early violins and battered Judaica are all sort of dingy and iffy-looking, and you halfway suspect that that gilt-edged clock from 1746 chimed its last chime in 1752 when the shoddy mainspring gave way.
Part of this, I suppose, you have to chalk up to Slovakia's recent independence: since the Czech Republic got to keep the capital city, it also kept all the museums there. So maybe they did go around to Slovak babushkas, asking them to scour their attics for collectables.
But still, this is a city whose claim to historical fame really is that "Napoleon slept here" (and signed a treaty, too, because he happened to be in the neighborhood). Hungarian nationalism worried me; Slovak nationalism just leaves me mystified. I mean, sure, the Habsburgs had no particular claim to lord it over Bratislava, but I find myself wondering whether there might have been some better bulwark against absolutism than ethnic nationalism.

Typically, clock components operated totally mechanically, making use of weights or curled springs to supply rotational pressure and a network of equipments to obtain secs, minutes, and also hours. Pendulums and escapements governed the frequency of ticking so that the force had not been applied simultaneously.

"The defendant made multiple spontaneous submissions admissions saying to police … 'I'll be smuggling smoko to buy bread and butter, I don't sell the big stuff'," Mr Prior told the court.
Legal Aid Queensland solicitor Trish Price said Jimmy admitted to a 110g parcel being his own, but claimed the other 600g parcel belonged to the people he was travelling with.
"His role was that he knew that the drugs were on board the boat … they weren't his but nevertheless he participated in bringing them across," Ms Price said.
At the island, Jimmy attended a party where he drank two bottles of rum.
He then broke into a nearby home with two others, stealing alcohol and other items before returning to the party and drinking further.
The court heard Jimmy then returned to the jetty "heavily intoxicated" where he threatened a female police liaison officer with a rock, before confronting a male officer

Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, at the UCL Institute of Education, and Pennsylvania State University found that well educated parents of white children were most likely to allow their children to drink at age 14.
The study’s authors were keen to point out that while having better educated parents is generally a protective factor for children, previous research has shown that those who start drinking early are more likely to fail at school, have behaviour issues, as well as alcohol and substance problems in adulthood.
The study revealed that parents of white children who were employed, had more educational qualifications, and who drank alcohol themselves, were more likely to allow their adolescent children to drink than unemployed parents, those with fewer educational qualifications, and ethnic minority parents.
Parents who abstained from alcohol tended not to allow their children to drink, but among those who did drink, those fathers and mothers who drank heavily were no more likely to let their children drink alcohol than light or moderate drinkers.

A new study has found that heavy drinking can increase your chance of divorce—but only if one spouse is drinking significantly more than the other. According to researchers at the University of Buffalo, divorce rates are higher among couples that don’t share similar drinking patterns and that drinking the same amount as your partner is better for marriage whether you are a light drinker or a heavy drinker.
Lead author Kenneth Leonard followed over 600 couples through the first nine years of marriage, tracking how much each spouse drank and which couples suffered marital strife, separation, and divorce. He found that the divorce rate among couples in which one spouse drank heavily, 50 percent divorced in under a decade. The divorce rate among couples that drank similar amounts of alcohol was about 30 percent.
The study suggests that if both partners are light drinkers or if both partners are heavy drinkers, divorce is less likely. This could be because both partners have similar experiences with alcohol and have a greater tolerance for the negative experiences associated with heavy drinking.
Leonard warned that although his study suggests that heavy drinking by both spouses’ decreases the chance of divorce—it does not prove that heavy drinking means a good marriage. Drinking has been linked with domestic abuse, and heavy drinking by both partners could create a poor environment for children.

A million years ago, human nature pitted male against male to *win* the female. Women just looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders.
A million years later, the females wrestle verbally and physically for the male, regardless of whether his worth is perceived or actual. Heck - sometimes there isn't even a male involved. It's cruelty for sport.
Today, men mostly play nicely, or not at all. Women tend to play nasty with each other, even when there's nothing at stake, and no danger, perceived or otherwise. Yes, I'll admit this is a fairly sweeping generalization, as far as generalizations go, but the truth remains: women usually speak cruelly before they speak kindly. And I'm not sure why. Full stop.
Perhaps this is something you grow out of to a great degree?
Maybe it's a byproduct of a vicious circle of cruelty?
The average woman doesn't want to see another woman succeed, or grow, or be comfortable. Silly, huh?
Men, these conditions don't even hit their radar.
They don't spend hours at a time conversing with others about the worthiness of members of their gender.
If you can get yourself into the inner circle of the Old Boy's Club, you're set. Supported, fetted and included. Even if you aren't an Old Boy, there isn't anyone looking and judging. Males are agnostic. Women can gauge anything and come up with an opinion and a judgment; with a negative response greater than 50% of the time.
There isn't an Old Girl's Club, yet. Maybe we are still evolving.

On Twitter, people across the political spectrum accused Gillibrand of having “thrown Franken under the bus” — Gillibrand having been the first prominent Democrat to call for his resignation, following sexual-misconduct allegations against the Minnesota senator in late 2017. Though all too predictable, the backlash was a reminder of what happens when a woman stands up to a powerful man.
At the time of the Franken scandal, more than two dozen Democratic senators joined Gillibrand in asking for his resignation, and Franken stepped down shortly afterward. Yet this week, Gillibrand was rebranded an “opportunist,” depicted as a betrayer of Franken, and appears to be facing a backlash from potential donors already. Major Democratic Party donor, George Soros, had already expressed strong reservations about her candidacy in June last year, in view of her stand against Franken. And pundits have continued to speculate that this incident would haunt Gillibrand’s chances in 2020.
So the time is ripe to remember who is responsible for Franken’s misconduct, and its subsequent social and political fallout: Franken.
Even if you are among those who believe Franken should still be a senator today, you should redirect the bulk of your disappointment toward Franken himself.

This perception is clearly shown in the shared opinion among all groups in the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), for mature and young women and men, and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) in all provinces, that men should be considered the head of the household. A man has the responsibility to procreate, support, and protect the family and country. Afghan men are perceived to possess the qualities of being brave at the same time as they are honourable.

If you&apos;re a man, there are many advantages to being tall. Research has found that tall men are more attractive to women, are perceived as natural leaders, and tend to earn more money than their height-challenged counterparts.
But new research adds a considerable caveat to that truism: It seems this positive effect applies only to whites.
"Height means something different for black men," write psychologists Neil Hester and Kurt Gray of the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. "Height amplifies already problematic perceptions of threat, which can lead to harassment and even injury. For black men, being tall may be less of a boon, and more of a burden."
In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe three studies that back up this contention. The first looked at more than one million people who were "stopped and frisked" by the New York Police Department before the program was outlawed by a 2013 judicial ruling.
The researchers restricted their data to non-Hispanic black and white males, and controlled for several factors that could account for higher odds of being stopped by police, including age, weight, and local crime rates (real and perceived).
They found that "tall black men are especially likely to receive unjustified attention from police."
"At 5&apos;4", police stopped 4.5 black men for every white man," they report. "At 5&apos;10", police stopped 5.3 black men for every white man. At 6&apos;4", police stopped 6.2 black men for every white man."

Richard Keelan’s “The Waltzing Tree” is a suburban fairy tale about loneliness and transformation. It is a tale about overcoming the distance that traditional modes of masculinity place between our bodies and the fear of vulnerability that is part of those notions of masculinity. “The Waltzing Tree” explores complex intimacies and the resistance people often feel to types of intimacy that aren’t considered traditional.
Keelan tells a tale about care-giving and care-receiving between a man and a transformed tree, opening up uncertainties and complexities in their interactions and understandings of each other. Both share the property that the man has moved to – he because he has bought the land and the tree because their roots were planted in that ground long before the man moved to this space. This proximity allows them to both struggle with ideas of home and what it means for them to share this space and to cope with others infringing on their privacy.
The man, Johnathan, is only able to let his tight control of his masculinity and senses of propriety slip because the tree, David, still identifies as a tree and represents a complex gender identity. Johnathan fears what contact with David may mean, even while he is trying to rescue them.

But as we found out, the appeal of this woman, and David’s lustful desire for more of her, were only the beginning of an affair that unraveled many lives.
The fact that Bathsheba was first seen as an object is a point we must not overlook.
1. First, many women I know have, at one time or another in their lives, found themselves feeling like nothing but “objects”. Whether it is because of exterior beauty or physical assets or in a completely different realm, a woman is perceived as another person’s “object” because she provides some necessary household function. When any of us are relegated to nothing better than objects, items or things – our self-worth takes a pounding.

Women who experienced fewer hot flashes the day after participating in vigorous to moderate physical activity were more likely to be part of the group that felt they had control over their hot flashes. Women who had more hot flashes following exercise were likely to be those who felt they had very few ways of coping with their hot flashes, Elavsky and her colleagues report in a recent issue of Maturitas.

To me one explanation is that just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so too is performance. Studies have repeatedly shown that the same work is rated higher when attributed to a man rather than a woman. This applies in situations where there is a qualitative/subjective component of the assessment which includes most professional and managerial positions.
You might assume that men rate the performance of men more favorably than that of women and that women rate performance of women more favorably than that of men. The sad truth is, both men and women rate performance better when it’s believed to be performed by a man. For example, the same essay is rated as better when presumably written by a man than by a woman regardless of the rater’s gender. An unseen violinist is judged superior when introduced with a male name. (Some orchestras have musicians audition behind a screen so they won’t be biased by gender!).

The findings demonstrate a distinct gender bias when it comes to expressing anger and influencing people.
“Our results have implications for any woman who is trying to exert influence on a decision in their workplace and everyday lives, including governing bodies, task forces and committees,” said co-author of the study Jessica Salerno from Arizona State University in the US.
The researchers looked at how anger expressions affect group deliberations.
“We found that when men expressed their opinion with anger, participants rated them as more credible,” Salerno said.
“But when women expressed identical arguments and anger, they were perceived as more emotional,” Salerno noted.
The study featured 210 undergraduates who viewed a 17-minute presentation that was based on evidence from a real case in which a man was tried for murdering his wife.
To begin deliberation, participants had a preliminary vote of guilty or not guilty.
During the course of discussion, participants periodically answered questions about the extent to which they felt confident in their initial verdict.
“Participants confidence in their own verdict dropped significantly after male holdouts expressed anger,” the researchers stated.
“Participants became significantly more confident in their original verdicts after female holdouts expressed anger, even though they were expressing the exact same opinion and emotion as the male holdouts,” the study said.

A self respecting woman who is economically and emotionally independent may not choose to suffer such a relationship. On the other hand a woman who is weak may choose to go to any length to put up with the relationship.

He watched the woman sit on the small bench across from him, place her small black purse down beside her, and start reading the paper. John guessed her to be at least fifty, but not because of the way she looked. Her hair reached to her shoulders and was a dark brown that was just beginning to show hints of grey.

“Students, and in my experience especially the non-humanities engineering majors, think that the reason for writing in many classes—for the professor to see, grade, and stuff in a file to be forever lost to the void—is a waste of time. However, I drove home the point that writing for Wikipedia is a real transaction between the student and the real-world reader,” she wrote in a reflection on our blog early last year.
In 2017, Sheppard, with the support of the Wikipedia Education Foundation, introduced a semester-long assignment in her History of Science in Latin America course to promote student engagement and support student learning. Pairs of students selected an article related to science and Latin America on Wikipedia to edit. They analyzed the article for content gaps, did research, and wrote additional text that was then peer-reviewed. Using critical thinking, research, writing, and editing skills and their own knowledge from STEM fields, the students wrote for a public audience within the standards of scholarly publication. By the end of the first semester, the 26 students in the class added 28,300 words to Wikipedia in 11 different articles ranging from Aztec society to Spanish Missions in the Americas.

I would like to have the ability to specify that a Complete/Incomplete assignment is worth 0 points (i.e. it's a bonus) but that a student should get x number of points if the assignment is marked complete.
As it currently stands, if a Complete/Incomplete assignment is marked as 10 points, then the student receives 10 points for Complete & 0 for Incomplete. But because the assignment is worth 10 points, it is counting toward the grade.
On the other hand, if you make the assignment worth 0 points, so that an Incomplete does not count against the student (which is the definition of "bonus") then a Complete will add 0 points to the score, which isn't helpful.

The interview articulates some of the ideas and issues surrounding Cronin’s now-extra-credit assignment for students to ask a person out on a date–with specific parameters given for the date–and to reflect upon it. In all, the article gives an interesting image of Cronin and her assignment as it relates to currently-prevailing social narratives about the early college experience, although there are some problems to be found.
Some of the problems are noted explicitly in the article. Wyllie reports Cronin as acknowledging the fraught nature of entangling students’ work with their romantic lives–although Cronin is correct to note that teaching students means teaching the whole student, and that means their interpersonal relationships become relevant to what occurs in the classroom. (Necessarily, those who view college as job training will disagree; personal and professional lives are “supposed” to be separate insofar as a person has or is allowed to have a life other than the professional.)

This Saturday I finally had time (and motivation) to tackle the closet!
I tried on every article of clothing in my closet so I knew exactly what fit and whether or not it was something I wanted to keep.
All of the clothing items that fit, I placed on the top rack so I can see exactly what I have to wear!
My wardrobe! Minus 2 outfits in the laundry and the one I’m wearing! I do believe I have accomplished a minimalist wardrobe! It actually is quite nice because every item hanging up is something I love to wear so it actually makes getting dressed easier!
I really am enjoying my simplified closet! I love that it is uncluttered, minimal and organized!
Love it! I keep telling myself to simplify, but I'm really hesitant to throw things out. Then I'll do some messy housework and need a ratty t-shirt, and I'll think "You see! You do use these"- except who needs 8 ratty t-shirts? I'm moving in a few months and I'm going to purge pre-move – and I'm going to remember your lovely closet as inspiration!

Since then, I’ve put a shoe rack in place of the shelves and I hung my necklaces about eye level above the shoe rack.

Fuel for Thought » Should social media ever be used for disciplining your child?
But should children be publicly disciplined? To me, it’s a bit reminiscent of days long ago where there were public floggings and people were put in stocks in front of the whole town. Does the world need to know your child has done something worthy of punishment? Does public embarrassment and humiliation take the place now of course correcting your child in lieu of the good old-fashioned idea of taking away a favorite like the computer or Internet access?
I must admit I’ve threatened public humiliation. Twice I’ve said I would post a YouTube video of my daughter’s messy room, a video where I take a popular song like Brittany Spears’ Toxic and change the words to reflect the state of her bedroom. The mere threat worked…and I didn’t have to subject the world to my off key singing.

I am sharing the not so glamorous start to our closet makeover on a budget. In the next few weeks I will be sharing all the projects we did to complete this makeover and first up is the DIY Beadboard ceiling and crown molding on the cheap!
One of the main reasons to do my closet makeover was to fix the water damage that was caused by an old roof leak. The roof was replaced, but we never repaired the ceiling or the wall in this area. The main reason: Mr. DD didn’t want to do this repair was because the ceiling and the walls are plaster. Repairing damage to plaster is much harder than drywall. We decided that we would rather install the beadboard ceiling instead of replacing a section of the plaster ceiling.
I started by clearing everything out of the closet. I tore down the wall border and began to repair the walls.
This is a picture of how not to find a stud in the wall. Yes, they make stud finders, but most of those are for drywall, remember, we have plaster. We did use this plaster wall stud finder, on the other walls and it works pretty well. It detects the metal in the lath, and most nails are in the same spot on the lath. When we originally installed the Rubbermaid Closet system (years ago) we were trying to find a stud in the wall to attach the support bar. We have since discovered that this particular wall

The estranged husband was shattered as he stood in the courtroom hearing his wife's stern decision for a divorce.
He was perplexed over her decision as both denied having any problems in their marriage but still the woman was adamant on being separated.
The reason the woman stated for seeking a divorce was that her husband abandoned his own mother and family to be with her. 'I can never trust a man who does everything to keep his wife happy while he denies even a small favour to his mother,' she told the judge.
The woman also stated that her husband had done everything for her, from taking her to foreign trips to buying her expensive gifts. However, his attitude towards his own family had struck a sour note in their marriage, the woman was quoted in Saudi Gazatte.

The man, whose identity has not been released, was arrested after an incident around 3:30 a.m. Tuesday in the 3500 block of Wells Road in unincorporated Oakley. Callers reported hearing a woman screaming for help.
After some callers told deputies a naked man was seen struggling for control of an infant with a woman, other callers said she had managed to hand the infant to others who kept it safe nearby.
At some point after that, the man tried to throw the woman off a balcony, but four neighbors arrived and managed to control him after a struggle, and the woman got away.
When deputies arrived, they found the man held on the ground by others. After handcuffing him, they found that he was unresponsive, freed him and began performing CPR. Paramedics soon arrived, and tried life-saving measures for 10 minutes before taking him to a hospital.
Authorities said an autopsy was scheduled for Friday.
The infant was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure.

In ancient Japan, small communities worked together to maintain rice farms. An obligation existed for each small community to help each other in time of need in order to ensure the survival of the community. So, if one farm needed help in some way the community would work together to help that farm. Later, the farmer being helped would be obligated to help others in the community. From this was developed a strong sense of social obligation to maintain harmony in order to keep balance in social relationships. If someone were to help you, you are obligated to help them in return. In comparison in American culture, we have a similar concept, yet we do not expect someone to feel obligated to help us out of necessity if we help them.
In modern times this sense of Giri exists to maintain harmony in relationships. For instance, if someone gives a gift, then the other person must give an equal gift in return. If a gift is not given, then a strong sense of debt or obligation is felt until an equal gift is given in return. To lose Giri is to face strong social shame.

People invited to a wedding shower should be on the guest list for the wedding. However, the exception to shower guests also being wedding guests, is if the coworkers give the bride-to-be an office shower.
Wedding invitations can be sent anywhere from 4-8 weeks prior to the event. Your invitation might still be on its way. If you know a coworker that was invited to the wedding, then ask them to inquire discretely about your invitation. It's possible your invitation was misplaced since you are invited to three showers.
You do not have to bring a gift at each bridal shower, only the first one. However, many people feel awkward going to a shower empty-handed. So, you could give a small gift at each shower. Or, opt to only attend one shower. You are not obligated to attend any.

In reality, it is how Christianity has spread and survived for 2,000 years. Christians sharing their faith through sermons and personal witness.
The Bible tells us that some people are gifted or called to the role of evangelist. It is an “office” of the church like pastor, prophet, apostle and teacher as mentioned in Ephesians 4:11. Many of us could name people who have filled this role and in doing so affected the lives of hundreds, thousands or maybe even millions. In modern times, Billy Graham is the most recognized name to have filled the role of evangelist.
One of the dangers of recognizing people who are called or gifted as an evangelist is that we tend to abandon our own responsibility to evangelize the world. I have frequently mentioned that evangelism is not one of my gifted areas. I do fill the role of pastor or teacher, but have never felt like I was an evangelist. I have always felt more comfortable helping people become a better disciple rather than leading them to an initial coming to faith or belief in Christ.

Yuli Edelstein, the speaker of Israel’s legislative body, said last week that he may skip the event if the prime minister will speak at it. In previous years, prerecorded messages from Netanyahu were played at the torch-lighting ceremony. Edelstein argued that Culture Minister Miri Regev’s decision to invite Netanyahu to speak would lead to politicization of the traditional event. “The ceremony was never the domain of one tribe or another in Israeli society,” he wrote in a letter to fellow lawmakers.
Because Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández is set to attend the ceremony, Netanyahu is obligated to be present, as he is at any occasion when Israel welcomes a foreign head of state. However, he is not required to make any public remarks.
The last time Netanyahu participated in the torch-lighting ceremony was in 1998, when he was also prime minister.
Last week saw public disagreements on the issue between Edelstein and Regev, both member of Netanyahu’s Likud party. Edelstein took to Twitter to express disappointment with Regev’s proposal. “I am sorry that the culture minister is trying to damage, for the first time in the state’s history, a traditional, beautiful and value-laden ceremony, which is the pure and beautiful expression of the people of Israel and the nature of being Israeli,” he wrote.

As you can imagine, this would make it very difficult for you to successfully run your offense as a team, which would in turn decrease your chances of winning basketball games. With that said, let's examine the fundamentals of catching a basketball.
Fundamentals Of Catching A Basketball.
When you're trying to catch a basketball, you should not "fight" the basketball but relax your hands, shoulders and arms as much as possible and "give" with the basketball. Your hands should be out-stretched ready to receive the basketball and guide it to your body. The basketball should be caught with the fingers which are held cup shaped.
When a teammate drops a pass or fumbles the ball, it is usually because he took his eyes off the ball for a split moment in order to locate the position of his opponent. Hey may also be trying to receive the ball with one eye on the ball and the other eye on the opponent.
Instead, the player catching the basketball should "look the ball into his hands." And, it is only after the ball has been successfully received should he worry about his opponent or trying to score. Doing this would greately decrease his

The Poke Ball in original Japanese language versions) is a spherical device used by Pokemon Trainers to capture wild Pokemon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pokemon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pokemon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pokemon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily captured. Legendary Pokemon will resist being caught much easier, and will often require many Poke Balls or more powerful Poke Balls in order to catch them. If the player attempts to capture a non-player character's Pokemon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft, stating that it is illegal to capture a Pokemon already owned by a trainer.
As depicted in the anime and manga series, the Poke Ball, when not in use, is the size of a golf ball and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a baseball. The Pokemon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pokemon, a beam of red light converts the Pokemon into energy to reclaim it. Poke Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pokemon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.

Godfrey was sent off in the 75th minute of Tuesday night’s Checkatrade Trophy group game, which Town lost 1-0.
From the footage it appeared that Godfrey had won the ball, but the FA have decided to uphold Trevor Kettle’s original decision.
Chief Executive Brian Caldwell, who had help put Town’s case forward, was disappointed with the decision.
“I think we are all really disappointed with that – we’ve taken a bit of a kicking from the FA this week”, Brian told ShrewsWeb.
“When you look at the footage and slow it down to 25% you can see that Ben actually gets the ball first. The opposition player slides to ground very early, Ben gets a touch on the ball, the ball the ricochets back off the Walsall player’s foot and goes out of play.
“I can actually understand from the referees view in live action that the Walsall player got to the ball first and Ben had caught the player, but that’s actually not the case when you slow the footage down.
“We hoped common sense would prevail, but they’ve turned that down and said that they’ve upheld the referee’s decision, but to me it would seem a pretty clear cut case because he got to the ball first and it was actually his other leg that made any contact with the Walsall player.

Once a defensive player has initially obtained a legal guarding position (feet on the floor, initially facing and there first), the defensive player may always move to maintain position and may even have one or both feet off the floor when contact occurs with the offensive player.
After obtaining a legal guarding position, the defensive player is allowed to move sideways, or backwards to stay in the path of the dribbler (but not directly into the dribbler).
Look to see who caused the contact! Dispel the myth.
A post player should be expected to be guarded as closely as possible from all sides. When a post player turns or rises to shoot and makes contact with a defensive player, who has obtained a legal guarding position, it is either a no call or a foul on the offensive player if the contact is such that an advantage is gained or the defence is placed at a disadvantage.
There is no restriction as to how high a player may bounce the ball, provided the ball does not come to rest in the player’s hand. When in contact with the ball, as long as the dribbler’s hand stays on top of or on the side of the ball, the dribble is legal, regardless of the height of the ball or the number of steps between bounces.

Q: What is the ruling if the ball hits the ground as it is pitched?
A: If a pitch touches the ground and bounces through the strike zone it is a "ball". If such a pitch touches the batter, he shall be awarded first base. If the batter hits such a pitch, the ensuing action shall be the same as if he hit the ball in flight.
Q: Is the hand considered part of the bat?
A: The hand is not part of the bat. Many people think that the hand is part of the bat and that a player shouldn't be awarded first if hit in the hand. This is incorrect. As long as the batter is attempting to get out of the way and is hit in the hand, then the correct call is to award the player first base.
Q: What happens if a pitch touches a players clothing but not the players body?
A: As long as the uniform is properly fitting, the batter should be awarded first base.
Q: What is the ruling if a pitched ball hits a batter and then hits the bat?
A: Once the ball hits the batter, the ball is dead and the batter should be awarded first base.
Q: Can a player be awarded Hit by Pitch (HBP) on a strike?

I am pretty sure that any player in the field (defense) can call a time out. Base runners? I would think if he has a base running reason like tying his shoe.
I’ve seen catchers call time to go talk to the pitcher on the mound.
And managers (the old looking guys that are in a baseball uniform but rarely come out of the dugout) can call time, usually to replace a pitcher.
That last is an interesting evolution that is not in the rule book. The manager calls time out. There is a place for each team, adjacent to the field that is called the Bullpen. Essentially just a long narrow area where pitchers can warm up while the game is in progress.
The manager gets to the mound and starts talking to the pitcher–many times the catcher also comes out to the mound. The pitcher is most likely holding the ball. So, while you cannot hear what they are saying out there, you keep your eye on the ball. If the pitcher gives the ball to the manager, that means he is being relieved. The manager then passes the ball to the relief pitcher, and usually jogs off the field (remember, they are usually old guys). Play continues when the Umpire signals it.

Coach Jim Huber, probably one of the best basketball curriculum producers in the USA, has developed a competitive game drill that will boost confidence, fun, and results to master finishing over helpside defenders off of a ball screen.
1.	Place two cones at the top of the key. The cones represent the feet of the screener.
2.	Player 1 has the ball on offense and starts at half court.
3.	Player 2 is on defense and starts opposite of Player 1 at the block.
4.	The drill is initiated when Player 1 hard dribbles downhill, fakes one way then gets even with the cones (the use of the ball screen).
5.	When Player 1 is dribbling downhill, Player 2 sprints to the opposite block then runs up to immediately help by contesting and defending Player 1.
6.	If Player 1 scores, they stay on offense.
7.	If Player 2 gets a stop, they then rotate and play offense.
To effectively use a ball screen, players must set up their primary defender by getting them below the screen. Once a defender is caught on the screen, it is difficult to get out.
If they do get out, the ball handler should go shoulder to shoulder with the screener, allowing no air space for the caught defender to escape. This leads to the primary defender getting beat and chasing from behind, leading to

Several basic rules are dedicated to organizing and regulating kickoffs, but every level and organization might have a variation in the rules. For example, high school football enforces kickoff rules based on the field layout and ability level of the players.
Along with the general outline and markings on the field, an X is painted on the middle of each 40-yard line to indicate the location of the tee position for the kicking team. However, the kicker can move the tee to another location on the same line if he chooses. The kickoff marks the beginning of each half of the game along with the transfer of possession after a touchdown or field goal. Each team has to have 11 players on the playing field during the kickoff.
The kicking team is allowed to line up on its own end of the field behind the 40-yard line. The layout and positioning of the players can change as long as every player is behind the 40-yard line. As the kicker approaches the ball, he must kick the ball before any of the other players cross the 40-yard line.

Working on your fitness level is important of course, so jogging, aerobics and working out in the gym would be one option. Rope skipping is very good, because it improves both your fitness level and your coordination.
But there is a technical aspect to it. One thing you should learn is the split step. Next time you watch a tennis game on TV, do not follow the ball but watch one player all the time. You will see that whenever the opponent hits the ball, the receiving player seems to jump up a little bit. Actually, he pushes himself off the ground, lands with his feet a little wider apart and in a "ready-to-move" position. It is like a wake-up call to the muscles, making them ready for a sprint towards the next ball.
Another function of this split step is for the player to be in a balanced position facing the opponent, so that he is able to start in either direction. By properly executing the split step, you will never be caught on the wrong foot, and you will shorten your reaction time.
You have to extra work to do the split step, but the upside is you will have more time to get to the ball, thus reducing the amount of energy needed to reach that next ball.

It took 3 ½ hours for about 220 officers and 18 National Guardsmen to methodically search the protesters' temporary homes on Thursday. Authorities said they arrested 46 people, including a group of military veterans who had to be carried out and a man who climbed atop a building and stayed there for more than an hour before surrendering.
Native Americans who oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline established the Oceti Sakowin camp last April on federal land near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to draw attention to their concerns that the project will hurt the environment and sacred sites — claims Dallas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes. The camp gained increased attention starting in August after its population had grown and authorities made their first arrests. At its height, the camp included thousands of people, but the numbers had dwindled during the winter and as the fight over the pipeline moved into the courts.

Faith consists of substance and evidence. Sounds logical. But it based on things hoped for and not seen. Sounds shaky. The NIV is even more confusing. It translates the latter half of the verse as being “certain of what we do not see.” How can we certain of what we haven’t seen?
Well, it’s not as strange as you might think. We do it all time. For example, in Monday’s paper there was a story about a man being bitten by a dog. I didn’t see it but I believe it happened. Why? Because I trust the testimony of those who did see it. I trust the evidence presented even though I didn’t witness it firsthand.

It’s unclear where the Crown of Thorns, considered by some to be the French equivalent of Britain’s Crown Jewels, was stored in the heavily damaged church. Notre Dame spokesman Andre Finot told reporters that several of the church’s prized items were stored in a vault that he believed would be safe from the fire’s ravages.
Saint Louis’ tunic is a relic made of linen that belonged to King Louis IX, the king of France from 1226 until 1270. He carried the Crown of Thorns into Paris in 1239 while possibly wearing the tunic.
The recovery of the artifacts is the latest bit of optimism for French officials and Notre Dame aficionados around the globe, who have been watching intently since Monday’s fire laid waste to large swaths of the church’s heavy timber construction.
Initial reports from French leaders painted a dour picture of the 12th-century Cathedral’s chances for survival. More than 400 firefighters battled unusual and grueling conditions that defied modern-day firefighting techniques, experts said.
Bryant and others say the combination of a structure that’s more than eight centuries old, built with thick, bone-dry wood beams amid soaring open spaces, and a lack of fire-protection systems left firefighters with few options.

One tradition was that the Roman Emperor was having difficulty getting enough soldiers for his army, it was thought it was because the men were reluctant to leave their wives and families and the Emperor had banned marriages and engagements of soldiers.
Valentine defied the edict and continued to perform marriages. He was arrested, beaten and beheaded. He was executed on Feb. 14, in about 269 A.D., according to church tradition. St. Valentine, it seems, was a martyr for upholding the importance of love and marriage.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the indictment hadn’t been publicly announced yet, told The Associated Press that a grand jury would indict 21-year-old Dylann Roof. The move has been expected since Roof’s arrest after the June 17 shootings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston.
Federal officials have previously said that the shootings generally meet the legal requirements for a hate crime and that federal charges were likely. Roof, who is white, appeared in photos waving Confederate flags, and survivors told police that he hurled racial insults during the attack.
Roof already faces state charges including nine counts of murder. State prosecutors have not said whether they’ll seek the death penalty.
Hate crime cases are often challenging for the government because it must prove that a defendant was primarily motivated by a victim’s race or religion as opposed to other factors frequently invoked by defense attorneys, such as drug addiction or mental illness.
Last year, a federal appeals court in Ohio overturned hate-crime convictions against Amish men and women accused in beard- and hair-cutting attacks against fellow Amish who were thought to have defied the community leader. The court held that the jury had received incorrect instructions about how to weigh the role of religion in the attacks and that prosecutors should have had to prove that the assaults wouldn’t have happened but for religious motives.

The Winston County Sheriff's Office posted an update on Facebook on Tuesday saying 70-year-old Sidney Burgess of Birmingham had been located.
The retired Presbyterian minister was last seen Saturday on a hiking trail, and his car was found Sunday at a trailhead where he began a day hike.
The area is remote and lacks cellphone service, and crews went out looking for the man. Storms interfered with the search on Monday.
The sheriff's office says authorities are assessing Burgess' condition. He is a former pastor at Edgewood Presbyterian Church in the Birmingham suburb of Homewood.

Turns out the whole waiting thing has a fancy name to it and can actually be pretty useful for business. It’s called On Hold Marketing, and it does not have to be annoying to your caller!
On Hold Marketing or messaging is a service used by businesses and organizations of all sizes to deliver information to their callers waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. According to studies, 80% of calls are put on hold every time they call a business. And callers wait up to 70% longer when they hear interesting information on a product or service.
An On Hold Marketing System is not just a cost-effective way to promote your business. It’s the most inexpensive targeted marketing solution available.
In Atlantic OnHold, we will always find a right approach to your audience. If a caller has an issue, they would be less receptive to an announcer with a higher or vibrant pitch to their voice. For a younger audience, a deep or commanding vocal style might not be the right choice to captivate your caller.

A CONSULTATIVE Transfer allows you to put the inbound caller on hold while you call the intended end users extension. Once you have made contact with the intended end user (or their voicemail) you can speak with the end user and discuss the next action, which is to patch the call through to the end user, or not.
To patch the inbound caller through to the intended end user, simply press the "transfer" soft key or hang up your phone.
If the intended end user does NOT want to accept the call, they will end the call by hanging up the phone or pressing their "end call" soft key.
This will put the inbound caller on hold on your phone. At this point you can resume the call by pressing the "Resume" soft key, and let the inbound caller know the intended user is not available, or you can transfer the inbound caller using the "Transfer" soft key to another extension, or the intended callers voicemail.

More often than reality would permit, they'll even indicate, even insist, that they never put anyone on hold.
It’s time to acknowledge the “call center in the room” and embrace on hold time – only then can you transform “waiting” into something proactive, educational, and beneficial for your company.
Because, whether you like it or not, almost every business and call processing system, automated or not, will ultimately have callers on hold.
Some companies go beyond thinking their are no callers on hold to advertise that they don’t have on hold time, and that there will always be a live representative waiting to take your call. Though this is ideal, this promise creates an expectation – and when callers discover that their expectations aren’t met, they are even more frustrated on hold, and caller abandonment increases.
First, it is important to understand that hold time is not indicative of non-responsiveness – most callers understand that major corporations receive thousands of calls a day, even if they groan and complain. It is the silence, the transfers, the unknowing that makes customers antsy.

Calls can be transferred between the extensions of the PBX, or even to public phone numbers. When an important call arrives, Tom can transfer the call directly to the Joe’s mobile and the caller will never know what happened.
Never miss important messages when you’re out of office! The voicemail feature answers calls after a certain amount of time and records the caller’s message. Recorded messages can be retrieved

The announcement follows an investigation by The Daily Caller News Foundation that showed neither the DHS, nor the Office of Government Ethics properly examined major ethics violations related to his fast-tracking of visas for a company run by Hillary Clinton’s brother.
DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday that Mayorkas is leaving the agency a couple months early — before the Obama administration comes to a close and a new administration takes over.
“I am writing to inform you that my last official day as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security will be October 28th,” Mayorkas said in an email obtained by TheDCNF.

The relevance of these state functions for predicting the direction of chemical processes in isothermal-isochoric and isothermal-isobaric ensembles, respectively, is derived. With the various state functions in hand, and with their respective definitions and knowledge of their so-called natural independent variables, Maxwell relations between different thermochemical properties are determined and employed to determine thermochemical quantities not readily subject to direct measurement (such as internal energy). Armed with a full thermochemical toolbox, we will explain the behavior of an elastomer (a rubber band, in this instance) as a function of temperature. Homework problems will provide you the opportunity to demonstrate mastery in the application of the above concepts. The final exam will offer you a chance to demonstrate your mastery of the entirety of the course material.

I was inspired when I saw a square wood pallet at a craft store and it was just asking for me to DIY my own memo board. My blog post earlier this week about my studio packaging corner was tied in with square prints from Artifact Uprising, and this memo board just had to have some of those prints too.
I originally wanted to paint the pallet, but in the end opted to keep it natural for a more rugged feel. I hammered in the sewing pins with my kid’s toy hammer (worked like a charm) and used them as “nails” to hang the binder clips from. A much more prettier option! I also used the pins to secure the cork pad onto the pallet.
The test tubes were hung using rubber bands and skinny wood sticks. On the backside of the pallet, I placed two skinny sticks on top of each other, wrapped a rubber band around them multiple times, pulled one end through a slit in the pallet, and slid the glass test tube under the rubber band. It creates a snug fit that way, but still allows you to remove the tubes for cleaning.
Hope this inspires to you create a memo board of your own! There’s so many different ways to style this, so many different accessories you can nail on to hold whatever it is you want your memo board to hold for

To start building your rubber band ball you have to to take two rubber bands and criss cross them across the bouncy ball.
Now that you criss crossed them you have to take a rubber band and put it sideways on top of the other rubber bands. Once you do that just keep doing the same steps over and over again until you have a rubber band ball.

One possible solution to this issue is to place stoppers at the ends of the dowels to eliminate the possibility of them coming loose.
Rubber Stopper - This stopper requires no hardware and has a strong enough grip that the dowel can't be pulled out without a very large amount of force. However, it is very large relative to other options and is also the heaviest.
Rubber Clamp - This stopper gives a strong clamping force on the dowel if it is a size or two smaller than the dowel diameter (1/8" clamp to 1/4" dowel as shown). However, it does require hardware, and is relatively heavy.
Vinyl Clamp - Much like the rubber clamp although slimmer and cheaper, it gives a sufficient clamp force and does require hardware.
Rubber Band - The looped rubber band is the cheapest and lightest option, and also gives a grip force very similar to the rubber stopper.
Nylon Clamp - While lighter and cheaper than its metal counterparts, the nylon clamp provides less grip force and requires hardware.

Knots fall into two categories: permanent and temporary.
Permanent knots are the most commonly known knots to tie balloons, and there is really only one type of permanent knot: the simple overhand. Permanent knots are usually pulled tight so they are not un-tieable (hence, their name). When playing any balloon game that requires balloon popping, be sure to stick with permanent knots.
Inflate the balloon (duh). For best results, inflate so that 3/4 of an inch to an inch of uninflated neck remains-- overinflated balloons are difficult to tie.
Hold the balloon's neck as close to the inflated body as you can, in your left hand. Stretch the neck of the balloon with your right.
Wind the balloon's neck around two fingers (or three if you have the length to spare) and secure the neck against your index finger using your thumb.
Tuck the rolled lip of the balloon under the loop around your fingers.
Grasp the lip and pull through the loop. Extricate your left hand fingers from the loop and pull the knot tightly.
Important: When pulling the knot tight, it is advisable to slide the knot toward the balloon's body, and not away. Sometimes, especially with older balloons, the friction of pulling the knot will tear a hole in the balloon's neck-- if the hole

Omitting the finish on the FOB rubber and the paint on the key ring both give the fob a stable and non-shabby look. It might be black but consistent color is preferred above an unevenly deteriorated look. This is a detail, but the fob is in non-car settings a representation of the car somewhere else. The car shape is doing a good job, but the finishes unfortunately not.
Implementing this would costs less in the production and reduce a cheap look of the fob.

An ambulance was sent to her home but was turned back when it was just four minutes away. Her son Lawrence, 24, found Ann, 61, dead from cardiac failure at her home in Portsmouth, Hants, almost 10 hours later.
He checked his mother’s phone log and discovered she had called the NHS 111 line at 8.25am.
A GP turned up at 8.30pm, more than 12 hours after her call.
South Central Ambulance Service said it had launched two investigations into the tragedy on December 28 last year.
One will focus on why the ambulance was called back and the other on why it took so long for an out-of-hour GP to attend.

Maisie Dicks, from Merthyr Tydfil, died three days after telling her mother Sharon Stokes she was feeling unwell.
“I thought it was just a bug. If she had had a temperature or breathing difficulties, I might have thought differently,” Ms Stokes said.
When Maisie woke up on 30 December, Ms Stokes knew that something was wrong and immediately called an ambulance.
“Her eyes looked grey and strange and I saw a rash, so I called the ambulance,” said Ms Stokes.
“Her arms went black within an hour. It was so rapid, it was unbelievable.
Meningitis is rare but can strike fast.
Common signs and symptoms include fever, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, severe muscle pain, severe headache, stiff neck and a dislike of bright lights.
Suffers can also have convulsions or seizures, pale or blotchy skin, and spots or a rash.
In Maisie’s case, the meningitis had developed into septicaemia, a serious infection in the bloodstream.
Maisie was immediately put into an induced coma and stabilised when she arrived at the hospital.
“The whole time she was in hospital, she was stable. Even when I came home the night she died, she was stable,” said Ms Stokes.
On 1 January at 22:00 GMT, Maisie died at Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital in Cardiff surrounded by her family.

Shyteria Shardae “Shy” Shoemaker was 15 weeks pregnant and was already the mother of a 2-year-old girl. Shoemaker’s aunt told the Chickasaw Journal that the 23-year-old slept with the assistance of a breathing machine and used an inhaler to control her asthma attacks.
During the early hours of Jan. 27 Shoemaker called out for help before collapsing in her doorway, the Clarion-Ledger reported.
Shoemaker was gasping for air when her family decided to drive her to the emergency room at Trace Regional Hospital. Around 1:20 a.m., her cousin LeKearis Shoemaker dialed 911 to let dispatchers know they were heading to the emergency room. To their surprise, the dispatcher informed them that the ER closed down in 2014.
LeKearis said the family was told to head to the fire department. Six minutes later they arrived, and two firemen were waiting outside the station to help, Fire Chief Jonathan Blankenship told the paper.
However, Shy’s family felt the firemen weren’t moving with enough urgency, so they went to the downtown square and attempted to get help from a police officer.
Instead of requesting help, the officer allegedly told LeKearis and Shy’s other cousins to get down on the ground.
“[The officer] looked like he was shocked … like he was scared, like we were gonna rob him,” LeParishe Shoemaker said about the cop’s face.

Should Supermarket Bakeries be Required to Label Products?
The death of an 11-year-old Alabama boy, who died after eating a supermarket bakery cookie, raises the question of whether these bakeries should be required to label their products for possible allergens.
A crucial aspect of the lawsuit is whether a supermarket bakery should be required to label all of its products, many of which are made, either entirely or mostly, off premises, Allergic Living reports. Publix Super Markets, which sold the cookie, takes issue with that interpretation of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) and filed a motion for the case to be dismissed. In June, a U.S. district judge denied the Publix motion, finding that the family’s case has sufficient merit to allow the case to proceed.
The boy who died had multiple food allergies and asthma. In June 2014, on a visit to Tennessee, he ate a bakery department cookie purchased at a Publix store in Clarksville. His mother says she asked a bakery employee if the cookie contained tree nuts, one of the boy’s allergens. Based on the employee’s response, the mother bought the cookie for her son. After the boy ate three bites of the cookie, he said his mouth was burning. His mother gave him Benadryl, but the symptoms worsened, and he developed difficulty breathing. His mother administered his epinephrine auto-injector and his aunt called an ambulance. The child’s condition improved briefly during the ambulance ride, but in the hospital,

The couple was traveling north through Currituck when they realized the woman’s contractions were very close together and that delivery was imminent. Knowing they couldn’t get to a hospital in time, the father called 9-1-1 as he was driving.
Leary, a 4-year veteran of Currituck’s 911 Communications staff, handled the call with great skill and composure. While fellow telecommunicator Taylor Rolling immediately dispatched an ambulance from Currituck Emergency Medical Services, Leary instructed the couple of pull over to a safe location.

She provided step-by-step directions and the baby boy was born at 4:32 a.m. Leary continued to give instructions for the parents to care for the baby while the ambulance was in route.

My usual example, from 30 years ago now, is the Applied Materials salesman chatting with a prospect at the then notorious Wagon Wheel in Mountain View. In the course of the conversation, the salesman claimed that Applied Materials' then arch rival, Hugle Industries, was in serious financial trouble and was rumored to be heading for bankruptcy. Unbeknownst to salesman or prospect, standing behind them and overhearing them was the founder of Applied Materials' rival, William Bell Hugle. That was a Friday evening. On Monday morning, a $1,000,000 trade libel suit by Hugle Industries arrived at Applied Materials' front door.
After a lot of lawyerly skirmishing, the case was dismissed with Applied Materials paying some legal expenses of Hugle Industries, a pretty unremarkable event. Had it gone to trial, the stakes were pretty large. If the Applied Materials salesman hadn't had good reason to believe the truth of his statement, a large judgement could have resulted. The libel was not merely of Hugle Industries products, where more latitude is allowed for "salesman's puffing", but of Hugle Industries business and financial reputation, where the rules are stricter.
On the product side, the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One, in San Diego, California, recently provided further comfort to salesmen, who in the course of a pitch, disparage the competitions' products (but not their reputations). In the

Mexico: What do YOU know about vacation "timeshares"? Sound off PLEASE!
A ride on a resort shuttle bus can be very educational. At least that has been my experience. We rode from our Grand Mayan resort here on the Mayan Riviera into Playa Riviera yesterday and the conversation turned to timeshares.
Timeshares and drinking before noon!
The man sitting behind me had been a timeshare salesman for Marriott in Hawaii in a former life. He talked about the timeshare salesman's life. He had worked for Wyndham before getting the job in Hawaii. He talked about beginning his job.
Marriott would not let me do any sales until they had "de-sleazed" me. They would send me around with other salesmen. If I even opened my mouth they would kick me under the table. Marriott prides themselves in being the gentlemen of the timeshare industry.
Is that true? I know that when we bought our Grand Mayan week (not a Marriott property), the sales staff began at the front desk and continued unrelenting until we made the purchase. I think we were lied to but I guess the experience is seen in the eyes of the beholder. In Puerta Vallarta the woman at the front desk is famous around the timeshare holders world.

Well, we can all believe now.
Chapman made history in last night’s loss to the Padres by throwing a 105-mph fastball. Check it out here.
As Steve Henson of Yahoo! Sports tells us, it was the fastest pitch ever recorded in a major league game. The previous record was held by Joel Zumaya, who threw a 104.8-mph fastball during a playoff game on October 10, 2006. Chapman’s pitch actually topped out at 105.1 mph, according to Brooks Baseball.
Chapman threw 25 pitches in total last night, all of them over 100 mph. In perhaps the most entertaining matchup of the night, Chapman got Adrian Gonzalez to swing-and-miss on three consecutive pitches in the bottom of the seventh inning that reached 102 mph, 102 mph and 103 mph.
In addition to his history-making heater, the southpaw touched 104 mph on three occasions.

For many years the derelict house on the Wincanton Gateway retail park has been sticking out like a sore thumb greeting visitors to the town, who must pass it to either access the town centre or stay at the Travelodge hotel.
But now Wincanton residents have cause for celebration - because the house is no more.
Employees at Hopkins Developments - which owns the site - have been on site over the last few days with heavy machinery tearing down the house, which lies next to The Wagtail pub.
Once the house has been completely razed to the ground and the surrounding area cleared up, the vacant area can be take up by another business.
Nick Colbert, who represents Wincanton on South Somerset District Council, has welcomed this move.
He said: "I am very pleased to see another eyesore in the town being removed. Bit by bit the town is improving its image.
"The derelict site off Station Road now has the new extension to our primary school on it. The derelict former shop in Silver Street has been demolished and is well on the way to being tidied up.
"The derelict area of land behind the old Colbert Smith office was a no man&apos;s land, but following legal clarification as to ownership I was able to get that tidied up.
"This burnt-out house has been a topic of conversation for years, so I am overjoyed to see it is being demolished.

Okay, maybe you won’t consider it easy. But it can certainly be simple.
If you are overeating, maybe you are trying to feed something other than your body.
Maybe you have spiritual hunger.
Maybe you are hungry for social interaction.
Or maybe you want to feel valued, for who you are, or for what you’re doing.

“The dinner is so boring and so negative,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed for California.
If he follows through, it will be the third year in a row that Mr. Trump has skipped the annual gala in Washington.
Mr. Trump enjoys the optics of railing on the media instead of gathering with them for the scholarship dinner, which traditionally involved a comedian roasting the president and then the commander in chief getting a turn to snap back with funny quips.
Supporters of the president say the dinner is too “inside the Beltway,” making it dissonant to Mr. Trump’s base, though critics say he’s too thin-skinned to handle a few jokes.
The correspondents’ association decided to have author Ron Chernow speak at this year’s event instead of a comedian.
“We’re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present and future,” said WHCA President Olivier Knox.

Since horse and buggy, or wagon, or saddle horse was the only means of getting around (except for walking, and there was a great deal of that) there was a great deal of traffic in horses, that is trading and training horses.
Once, about 1903, Tom Clark went to Arizona and shipped in two carloads of unbroken horses. They were right off the range and not even halter broken. Two Spaniards were employed to break certain ones to ride. The corrals were in between the stable and the parking lot.
The bronc riders would lasso and drag a terrified rearing and striking horse onto Main street, where he would be blindfolded, saddled, and mounted in front of the livery stable. Then sometimes would follow some very exciting scenes. Our modern rodeos were pretty mild by comparison. In the first place the animal was not saddled in a shute as at rodeos, and secondly it was not a ten second ride but a ride to the finish, and sometimes the bronc came out the winner.
I remember one bronco in particular. He was a chestnut and far above the others in appearance. He had thrown the Spaniard twice, and the Spaniard had given up trying to ride him. My father fancied the animal and struck Tom for a trade. It galled Dad when Tom told him he wasn’t horseman enough

When you force a horse into the “correct” position, you lose something important. You lose the horses engagement. He trots around with his ears back wishing he were anywhere else. So when you want to generate power, energy and strength, like in jumping or dressage, he checks out and who can blame him? When the horse does not think you can keep him safe, he starts to spook at silly things: that jump he’s gone by a million times or the wind blowing or rain falling and then we can get mad at the horse for this, proving his theory about people is true.
The Basics: We will cover rules of engagement (in the herd). We will cover breath and energy. Saying hello. How to be a gentle leader. How to look out for him. How to show him when it’s safe to eat and drink (i.e.: is there a cougar around the corner he can’t see but you can?) How to push slowly from behind.
Resource management: If I set a dish of molasses-laden grain down, at liberty I should be able to call my horse away from it as if to say, “Now is not a safe time to eat.” Since he trusts that I will be fair, he knows that when it is safe, I will let him eat it.

A recreation of Chinggis Khaan’s Morin Urtuu postal system, the 1000 kilometer (700 miles) race is strung along a network of 27 horse stations on the Mongolian steppe, and has in its short life become an epic equine adventure of no equal.
ALL THE WILD HORSES follows endurance horse riders from the United States, Canada, South Africa, Ireland, United Kingdom and the Netherlands as they try and compete in this race.
The riders are out on the steppe on their own and navigate with GPS from horse station to horse station, spaced around forty kilometers apart. They battle extreme heat, extreme weather, swollen rivers and wild dogs, often on their own. They change their horses at every station, staying the nights out in the wild or with nomad families along the way. One wrong horse and they could be bucked off and lose their horse with help being hours away. Serious injuries, broken bones and heat exhaustion are a common and debilitating factor in the race.

But, after 48 years of training Thoroughbreds, and a few champion Quarter Horses too, he doesn’t seem to mind.
His thriving Gate to Great (GTG) organization has seen many graduates find success in a number of disciplines, including eventing, trail riding, and barrel racing. Although the training program is based on a foundation of ranch work, Simanton says many buyers come to him looking for their next fox hunter or eventer.
In addition to retraining and selling off-track Thoroughbreds, GTG also works to make sure the horses and their new owners are enjoying their lives together. Through the GTG “Enjoyment” Program, owners can win awards through a point-based system. Points are recorded by owners and earned for the hours they spend riding, training, and showing their horses. There’s also an annual GTG “Class Reunion” at Simanton’s ranch for owners to get an inside look at their training process.
Thanks to his horse Rikim, a “war horse” with 75 starts and $92,476 in earnings, Simanton has become a well-known and respected character at Retired Racehorse Project’s annual Thoroughbred Makeover events.

Then, he decided to try it himself—and a weird-but-true White House legend was born.
Coolidge was no stranger to equines, of course. He was an outdoorsman and a horse lover. Though he fell from a horse as a child, breaking his arm, he loved horseback riding for exercise.

Sam was unconscious, not breathing on his own and had had a seizure. While the local hospital stabilized Sam, doctors at the scene quickly realized the boy needed additional treatment elsewhere, and fast.

Ratzsch notified Air Methods dispatch that Sam might need another mode of transport, since the local hospital at the time did not have the neurosurgeon needed.

Criminal fraud includes forgery, trademark counterfeiting, credit card abuse, false statements, misapplication of fiduciary property, exploitation of a child or the elderly, and commercial bribery.
Criminal embezzlement is a subset of fraud. These cases are unique in that the fraudulent acts come from a person who was placed in a position of trust and originally obtained the property lawfully.

The ruling in Jerusalem District Court reversed a 2012 acquittal of the veteran politician, who led Israel from 2006 to 2009.
Last May, Olmert was sentenced in other proceedings to six years in jail for accepting $160,000 in bribes linked to a real estate deal in Jerusalem, when he served as the city's mayor. He is currently appealing that conviction in the Supreme Court.
The district court found that Olmert accepted cash-filled envelopes from an American businessman who hoped to further his interests in Israel. It convicted him of fraud and breach of trust on the basis of new testimony from a former aide who had accepted a plea bargain.
Facing corruption allegations, Olmert announced his resignation as prime minister in 2008, cutting short his pursuit of a peace deal with the Palestinians, and stayed on until a new government was in place after a 2009 election.
He has denied any wrongdoing in both cases, and his lawyers said they were considering appealing Monday's ruling.

Two men, Jeffrey Revell-Reade and Anthony May, were convicted at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday of conspiracy to defraud. Seven others, aged between 33 and 62, were convicted and sentenced last year, which can only now be reported fully.
Profits from the fraud were freely spent on luxuries including private jet hire, yachts, overseas properties and wine collections, the SFO’s director David Green said.
The defendants were found guilty after an SFO investigation aided by authorities in New Zealand, Hong Kong and the US, codenamed Operation Steamroller.
In 2012, Mr Revell-Reade, identified as the mastermind of the scheme, was extradited from Australia. Mr May, who used a series of off-shore bank accounts to distribute the proceeds of the fraud, was sent to the UK from Spain.
Mr Revell-Reade and a third defendant were found not guilty of a charge of corruption.
Six of the other members of the scheme have been sentenced to between three and seven years in custody, while one, 62-year-old Michelle Coleman received a suspended sentence.

Mortgage fraud refers to an extensive range of schemes and actions where individuals or companies use fraudulent information on mortgage documents for personal gain. Ultimately, a mortgage fraud scheme aims to obtain funding or monetary profit for a property that a borrower would otherwise not qualify for.
Though mortgage fraud is not classified as a specific federal charge, an individual may be charged under laws associated with wire fraud and bank fraud such as the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009. If more than one defendant is involved, federal conspiracy charges may be made.
Mortgage fraud typically stems from omissions, inflations, understatements, or misrepresentations in a real estate or mortgage transaction. More often than not, parties commonly accused of mortgage fraud are real estate professionals, mortgage brokers, real estate lawyers, and appraisers. In other instances, individual home buyers may also be involved in such investigations.

Lawmakers moved to tighten the law due to a spurt in incidences of fraud in the sector.
The prison term ranges from a minimum of one year to 10 years based on the seriousness of the offence and the amount of the embezzled money returned. In addition to jail, offenders will be made to pay a fine equivalent to the fraud amount.
Those committing fraud amounting up to Rs5 million will be jailed from one to three years while those involved in fraud amounting to more than Rs500 million will have to serve a prison term of nine to 10 years.
The punishment is more severe for those committing fraud at Dhukutis and cooperatives than at banks and financial institutions. Offenders face a maximum jail term of 10 years if the embezzled amount totals more than Rs1 billion.

According to Buzzfeed, Sophia has loved bugs pretty much her whole life. Her mom, Nicole Spencer, explains that her fascination began when she gave the child a bug-catcher when she was just a toddler. It was love at first bzzzz, and the little girl has been mad about insects ever since.
“Her best friend and her named themselves ‘The Bug Hunters’ — a name she still uses today,” Spencer shares. “For some reason I cannot explain, she has a connection with bugs.” Sadly, she had to separate from her bug-hunting best buddy when the family moved to a new town, meaning Sophia started at a new school.
Spencer says her daughter’s special relationship with bugs has other kids calling her a “weirdo” and taunting her in ways that would make any parent’s stomach turn. From being “dragged through mud” and hit, to a girl telling the other kids to stop playing with Sophia, the child has had a hard time adjusting to her new school. The most cringe-inducing instance of bullying? A boy who asked to see one of her bugs then stomped on it and killed it.

That being said, Sarah tried squash for the first time a few days ago. When we went to the doctor on Tuesday for her check up we got the green light to start giving her food with flavor. (I can only assume rice cereal has none because it looks like something that lacks flavor.) Dr. Catherine said that we had to wait 3 days before introducing a new food. I had no idea this rule is because it would take Sarah 3 days to eat one little thing of squash baby food. And at one point, I only got her to eat it by tricking her and mixing it with rice cereal!

The 16-year-old girl was experiencing a shortness of breath after attending a One Direction concert. She decided that having been over excited and screaming over zealously she would sleep it off, thinking that her throat just needed time to recuperate.
The next day the teen woke up to find that she was still short of breath so she went to the Emergency Room. Initially, medical attendants thought little of the injury thinking that it was simply a sore throat due to the screaming at the concert. However, after closer inspection, they came to find there was something odd going on. Although her lungs sounded fine when doctors pressed down on her skin around her neck there was a weird feeling.
“It felt like they were crushing Rice Krispies beneath their fingers,” Dr.Slaughter Jr. stated, the resident of Emergency Medicine at the time.
This condition is called Crepitus which is caused when air leaks into soft tissue beneath the skin. When pressed upon the skin will make sounds similar to that of Rice Krispies cereal and milk. Having discovered this condition Doctors jumped into action and ran more tests on the teen.

Mild-tasting, easily digested, and packed with iron, rice cereal is definitely the perfect first food for babies. That is, unless your perfect baby rejects it. Fortunately, even if your daughter continues to turn up her little nose and clench her tiny lips each and every time a spoonful of rice cereal comes her way, she won't go hungry. It's not the cereal your baby needs — it's the iron in the cereal. And while rice cereal is certainly an excellent source of that essential mineral, it doesn't hold a monopoly on it. In fact, because some studies have found high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice cereal, the FDA recommends infants (as well as children and pregnant women) eat variety of foods to offset any potential exposure to arsenic.
If your baby is bottle-fed, she's getting all the iron she needs from enriched formula. If she's breastfed, you can easily meet her requirement by giving her a supplement (ask your pediatrician for a recommendation). Besides, at this point in her dining career, solids are largely for the experience of spoon-feeding, not for nutrition. She's still getting most of what her growing body needs in liquid form.
But there are good reasons not to surrender when your baby rejects cereal. An older baby may become even more resistant to learning how to chew and swallow, preferring

Aurora had been found as a stray and waited patiently for her family to pick her up at the shelter. They never came and this sweet gal made her way to MaPaw. She is a social girl that loves humans and canine friends.
TJ had actually been surrendered to the shelter by his owners when they were forced to move (due to the economy) and couldn’t take him along. This pup had loads of pent up energy and it took him a few days at his foster home to burn it all off. He’s a love bug that loves all the attention he can get!

One week, she was sworn in as the first woman to hold the post. The next week, legislators were interviewing other candidates for the permanent job.
That's because the governor named Underwood to replace Eric Schneiderman, who recently resigned in disgrace. Now the legislature has voted to have her fill out his term.
On a vote of 190 to 1, the legislature named Underwood as the state's 66th attorney general. She was one of a dozen candidates, but said she would not run for election at the end of the term this year.
"I've served in many roles in government throughout my career, but I believe this job -- at this moment in history -- is the most important job I have ever had," she said after the vote.
On the eve of state party conventions, state assembly members and senators considered other candidates. Democrat and Republican leaders will choose nominees for the four-year term in November.
Assembly speaker Carl Heastie said the legislature might have chosen a different candidate if it were a mid-term vacancy. Assemblyman Joseph Lentol said lawmakers wanted to "preserve the continuity of the office."
Underwood had been the state solicitor general until she stepped in for Schneiderman, who abruptly quit amidst allegations that he physically abused four women. He resigned on May 7.

Dolezal could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted, according to KHQ.
Court documents allege Dolezal, who has legally changed her name to Nkechi Diallo, illegally received $8,747 in food assistance and $100 in child care assistance starting in August 2015 up until November 2017.
Investigators began looking into Dolezal's finances after learning she'd written a book, according to The Associated Press. Upon reviewing records, they reportedly found that she'd been listing her income as less than $500 per month.
However, subpoenaed records allegedly revealed bank statements showing Dolezal deposited nearly $84,000 into her bank account during the same period she was receiving public assistance.

"For our policy, he went well above and beyond what was required for that. So once the Safety Committee gets together, they review it, and if they agree, they will let me know and we will have a ceremony."

Raylene Marks worked at a Claire’s store in Edmonton for four months, but resigned following an incident in which a woman brought her seven-year-old daughter to the store on March 31 to get her ears pierced.
Marks and a colleague were to do the procedure together, piercing both ears at the same time. Despite their attempts to calm the crying child, she said the girl was adamant she didn’t want her ears pierced.
“She said, you know, ‘They’re standing too close to me, Mom. I don’t want them to touch me, Mom,'” Marks said.
Marks told her colleague she wouldn’t help with the piercings. Eventually, the mother and daughter left the store without the girl’s ears being pierced, she said.
“I thought, well, I really can’t tell parents how to parent their kids but I can certainly refuse to facilitate something that I think is against a child’s wishes,” she said.
Marks wrote about the experience in a widely shared Facebook post, highlighting a company policy that reserves the right to refuse piercing if it can’t be done successfully. She said the policy is vague and doesn’t address children’s emotional welfare.
In an emailed statement, a Claire’s spokesperson said customer well-being is the company’s top priority.

Enterprise developers can now "harness the power" of machine learning based anomaly detection analytics to manage complex online services, detect the earliest signs of advanced security threats, and gain insight to business opportunities and risks represented by changing behaviors hidden in their massive datasets.
"The massive datasets generated by the rapidly expanding world of the Internet of Things are so large and complex that it's virtually impossible for humans to spot important behavioral changes that could solve key issues, reveal the next big ideas, or even open doors to whole new markets," said Jeffrey M. Kaplan, Managing Director of IT strategic consulting firm, THINKstrategies. "The only way to overcome this challenge and capitalize on this unprecedented opportunity is to leverage machine-driven analytics that flag anomalous behaviors of significance so organizations can act on them."
Prelert's Anomaly Detective uses advanced analytics based on "unsupervised machine learning" to process huge volumes of streaming data, automatically learn normal behavior patterns represented by the data and identify and cross-correlate anomalies.
Prelert's analytics engine routinely processes millions of data points in real-time and identifies performance, security, and operational anomalies and their causes as they develop so they can be acted on before they impact business.
"Explosive growth in computing scale and the accompanying data it generates have made it increasingly difficult for software developers and DevOps practitioners to discover problems that arise in these massive infrastructures," said Donnie Berkholz, analyst

How about the detective could also share his results with one person he chooses? That person can be civilian, informant or spy.
That way, if a civilian get's the info, he could spread it to others in the thread (XYZ is not a civilian according to the info I got etc.), especially once the detective dies.
But since there is no proof that that person really got this info, informant and spy can pretend to have information too.
Of course, if the spy get's the info, he'll also know that this person isn't the detective.
Could make it a bit easier for civilians but wouldn't be overpowered?

We can try this for the next round. Is everyone okay with it?
I will write more once Im home.
Whilst in theory the Spy and/or Informant could fake it in practice it would be suicide because the actual Civilian who got the result would just announce theirs and the Spy and/or Informant would look really bad for having faked it. If the Spy and/or Informant got the actual result they would also have to probably announce it or risk coming under fire from the Detective who knows who they gave the info to. So all that happens is that a player is proven a phase and a Spy knows that that player isn't the Detective.

Retrieved Text: Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is a structural, asymptomatic, and infrequent anomaly, present in 0.3% of the general population and in 4.3% of congenital heart disease. Typically, the diagnosis reveals itself unexpectedly at the time of device implantations. Isolated PLSVC (PLSVC with absent right SVC [RSVC]) is usually asymptomatic, but it can pose difficulties with central venous access, device implantation, and cardiothoracic surgery. This condition is also associated with an increased incidence of congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, and conduction disturbances. Successful implantation of a permanent pacemaker from right subclavian route was done in a 70-year-old male patient with isolated PLSVC.
A 70-year-old male was admitted in our institution with a complaint of recurrent syncope for 10 days duration. A 12-lead electrocardiography revealed complete heart block (CHB). The probable etiology of CHB was kept as degenerative, after ruling out reversible causes. Temporary pacemaker lead was inserted uneventfully by femoral route. As per the government's funding scheme, the only option for permanent pacemaker implantation was single chamber VVI. Due to large experience of our institution, right subclavian approach was used. After puncture of right subclavian vein, it was impossible to advance a guidewire into the normal expected course of SVC, under fluoroscopy, the wire always being seen to coil in the left subclavian vein (LSCV) and guidewire to pass through left-sided SVC. A 9-French pacemaker sheath was inserted by modified Seldinger technique. On lead insertion, circuitous course of the lead via left mediastinum (PLSVC), instead of the expected right side, was noted [Figure 1]. Right upper limb venography

It is used to find data in the system that does not match with existing model of the data. Such anomalies are inconsistent with regards to remaining data and can affect reporting and analysis of data.
The anomalous data is identified by applying K-means clustering algorithm on the data sets and the data farthest from the center of the cluster is identified as an anomaly.
Nice article but somehow I have a different opinion over anomaly detection. The python version of anomaly detection and other major systems worldwide use Gaussian mixture model( probabilistic model ).
SAP has provided “ANOMALY” function but it runs using the K-Means with distance function. However consider an example which fits more like a high width and low height ellipse. Hence PAL’s ANOMALY function will fail in this scenario.
In this case even non-anomalous examples might fit at a far away distance( high probability) as compared to an anomalous one appearing very close to centroid but outside of the high probability range, hence for anomaly detection I would prefer using the GMM ( Gaussian mixture ) function over the ANOMALY function.

The initial investigation revealed three boys had been in the water earlier with a 10’ boat and a kayak. When the 14 year old attempted to pull one of the boats out of the canal as he was standing on a culvert, he slipped and fell in the water. The current swept the boy through the culvert, which was approximately 150 feet long. When deputies arrived they were advised by the two other boys that when the 14 year old boy fell in, they ran to the opposite end of the culvert but did not see the boy come out.

Retrieved Text: Following an extensive six-month review, the independent Engineering Review Board (ERB) chartered to examine data collected during the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle's (HTV-2) first flight has completed its review. The ERB concluded that the anomaly resulted from flight control authority limitations to operate at the angle of attack the vehicle was programmed to fly for the speed and altitude of the flight.
Detailed analysis conducted by the ERB revealed that the most probable cause of the HTV-2 flight anomaly was higher-than-predicted yaw, which coupled into roll thus exceeding the available control capability at the time of the anomaly. The analysis concluded that knowledge of several key aerodynamic parameters in this flight regime was limited.
According to David Neyland, DARPA Tactical Technology Office director, "The conclusions of the ERB indicate that no major changes to the vehicle or software are required to mitigate the first flight anomaly. Engineers will adjust the vehicle's center of gravity, decrease the angle of attack flown and use the onboard reaction control system to augment the vehicle flaps when HTV-2 flies next summer."
The first flight demonstrated significant accomplishments in the area of hypersonic flight. During the most challenging segment of flight, extensive data was captured for critical areas of interest to the program, (aerothermal, aerodynamic, thermal protection, navigation, guidance and control in the hypersonic flight regime). This knowledge enabled the ERB to confirm: "The HTV-2 flight anomaly is characterized as a slow divergence about the longitudinal axis (in roll) which continued until the roll rate reached a threshold where the autonomous flight system commanded

The apex court has asked the filmmakers to screen PM Narendra Modi for the Election Commission of India and let the poll body decide on the ban after watching it. The film's release was blocked by the poll body in view of Lok Sabha Elections 2019. 'PM Narendra Modi' Movie Release Stalled By Election Commission, ECI Says No Political Biopics Will Release During Lok Sabha Polls 2019.
The makers of the film had moved the Supreme Court on Friday after the ECI had blocked the release of all political biopics during General Elections 2019. The ECI, in its ban order, had said, "Biopics are a kind of surrogate promotions."
The movie was supposed to open in theatres on April 11, which again was a release date postponed from April 5. The movie, titled PM Narendra Modi, stars Vivek Oberoi playing the titular role.
Earlier this month, the court had left the decisions on stalling the release of the film to be made for the Central Board of Film Certification and the Election Committee to make. The court had said that the latter should decide whether the film violates the Model Code. Following this, the EC had stalled the film's release and the filmmakers had brought the film back to the apex court. It now remains to be seen as to what the ECI decides after watching the film.

So often movie-based games seem only to exist because every kids' movie and action movie has to have a videogame, and you can tell they were rushed to market because they're barely playable. This one, fortunately, doesn't fit that mold.
There are two ways to play the game: play the story, or go straight for the mini-games. The story starts before the movie does—spending an entire (tutorial) section on preparations for the flight from Madagascar, whereas the movie starts with the plane about to take off. There are quite a few mini-games, all of which (I believe) are incorporated into the game and also available from an "arcade" selection on the game's main menu. The story game is single-player (with multiple saved games available, so several people can play separately), and includes a lot of basic platforming and puzzle-solving, but also some very creative bits involving the movie's main characters—from Marty the zebra having to kick suitcases into cargo containers to Melman the giraffe rolling a spherical boulder back and forth to squash scorpions and knock other boulders to cover steam vents. The penguins are handled very well, with a lot of derring-do to find things to repair the plane—I was laughing at both the game and the cut scenes.

In the two and a half years since Spotify first launched in October 2008, several other competitors have emerged in the US such as Rdio and MOG, and services such as Last.fm, Grooveshark and Pandora have established themselves. Is there room left for another music service amongst music fans, or is Spotify simply a tech curiousity?

The movie is the true story of former Planned Parenthood director Abby Johnson, who later became pro-life. The film ended the weekend at number 5 behind high budget Dumbo, Us, Captain Marvel and Five Feet Apart. It actually outperformed Captain Marvel in per-theater revenue.
Unplanned has had a hard go at even being shown in theaters. With PG-13 content, the film received an R rating because of a computer generated image of a sonogram portraying an abortion.
Over the weekend, Twitter was forced to reactivate the account for the film after it was censored from tweeting out about the film’s success. In addition, ads were blocked from being run on the networks Lifetime, HGTV and the Hallmark Channel. Even the radio network KLOVE banned ads until www.metrovoicenews.com ran a story announcing the action and KLOVE listeners responded by bombarding the KLOVE Facebook page and corporate switchboard with messages supporting the film.
But those actions can’t stop a good movie. Reviews from Christian movie critics have been strong as well as those of moviegoers.
Strong turnout for movies and high per-screen revenue are what keep movies in theaters. Unplanned’s success is hoped by the those in the pro-life community to continue to grow to reach those who are undecided about the issue and young people who are bombarded with pro-abortion messages in mass media and social media.

In 1925, the Terminal was renamed the Metro, after a new and much larger Terminal Theatre opened across the street at 3315 W. Lawrence Avenue.
The theater was noteworthy because it was only one of a couple of movie houses in Chicago designed with “reverse auditoriums”, where the audience entered at the screen side of the auditorium, facing the rear wall of the auditorium.
The Metro closed in 1952 and the lobby area was converted into retail space, in addition to existing storefronts in the Metro building. In September 2006, the former auditorium portion of the Metro Theatre collapsed and was razed. In March 2008, the remainder of the building was torn down.

Point of view is the relationship between the photographer and the bird (or subject). Point of view is important because getting the best angle for the bird impacts the story your image tells. If you want the viewer of the image to instantly connect with the bird, take an image at eye level with the bird looking straight into the lens. The viewer will connect with the bird; there will be an emotional response and the viewer will “like” the image.
There are various ways to situate yourself in relation to your subject. Below, I offer insights into how to photograph birds.
If we’re standing up and shooting down on birds, the overall story of the image might be that we’re superior or above them. When a movie director wants to make a character seem weak, they shoot from above; if the director wants to make a character seem strong, they shoot from below, looking up at the actor. Shooting eye level doesn’t add an element of superiority or weakness – it’s neutral.
In this image of a Horned Grebe, I had my tripod fully extended and I was standing up on a dock that was a couple of feet above the bird, so I had about eight feet of height from the camera to the bird. When I look at the image, I don’t learn that much about the bird, and I don’t connect with it.

It was made for a 1946 world that required of a film, a good story, a beautiful woman, a handsome man. These were the basics surrounding the basic love story. The Bamboo Blonde was right for its time. The end of the war, looking back already at wartime romances. It should be viewed in its context and appreciated in that context. Frances Langford lights up the screen from the very beginning. Her honey voice bringing out all of the nuances of her songs which unfortunately are very under rated. Watch her facial expressions in Dreaming Out Loud. So put on your fedora and escape to another time and enjoy this wonderful film.
Thanks for your comment, Charles. One reason I started this blog was to get out of a contemporary mindset and immerse myself in a different world of film. I also listen to old radio shows day by day.

The sensation of watching a movie on the backlit Cinema LED screen – with its High Dynamic Range (HDR) picture quality and infinite contrast ratio – is unlike anything experienced before and the screen has been installed in different cinemas around the world.
Now, with increasing interest in the technology from movie experts and enthusiasts, Samsung has announced the launch of Samsung Onyx Cinema LED, a comprehensive cinema screen and sound solution for movie theaters.

Samsung Onyx invites movie-goers to experience a next-level viewing environment with the comprehensive solutions, Onyx VIEW, Onyx 3D and Onyx SOUND. As Samsung Onyx is unaffected by ambient light, Onyx VIEW upholds consistent and distortion-free picture quality that keeps audiences engaged and furthers realism. Featuring high brightness and picture quality, Onyx 3D takes realism to the screen and offers an immersive 3D experience. With support from JBL by Harman Professional’s sculpted surround sound system, Onyx SOUND expands the audio sweet spot within a given theater.

At 25, he had married Anne Dudley, 16, his childhood sweetheart. Anne had been well tutored in literature and history in Greek, Latin, French, Hebrew, as well as English.
The voyage on the "Arbella" with John Winthrop took three months and was quite difficult, with several people dying from the experience.

As Anne tells her children in her memoirs, "I found a new world and new manners at which my heart rose [up in protest.]"a. However, she did decide to join the church at Boston. As White writes, "instead of looking outward and writing her observations on this unfamiliar scene with its rough and fearsome aspects, she let her homesick imagination turn inward, marshalled the images from her store of learning and dressed them in careful homespun garments."
Historically, Anne's identity is primarily linked to her prominent father and husband, both governors of Massachusetts who left portraits and numerous records.

On the Slave Coast of West Africa in 1880, a land governed by witchcraft and superstition and where human life was cheap, torture by poisoning and boiling oil was the order of the day. Twins, believed to be children of the devil, were abandoned to die, and the mothers banished. But into that suffering came a woman who had been afraid to cross the street alone, who once refused to cross a field because there was a cow in it, who was terrified of crowds and public speaking. She immediately contracted malaria, responding with, “Heaven is now nearer to me than Britain.” Many times she looked death in the face—everything from crocodiles to angry witch doctors with cauldrons of oil. Meanwhile, she began saving twins from slaughter. If all the twins she rescued had remained alive, they would make up a big town, and it was her own money she used in all this endeavor. She said Christ had sent her with the Gospel and that He would look after the results.

The international perception of Nepal is often that it is a poor but happy society. But behind the sweet smiles of the women you may encounter on your Himalayan trek, is often a story of extreme discrimination, hardship, deprivation and abuse. Men, especially those from poor areas, with little education or prospects of a decent job, are apt to drink and take their frustration out on those of lower status than themselves – their wives and children.
Low-caste girls are at the bottom of the social heap. According to tradition, when girls start menstruation they are locked away in a darkened room for at least 7 days, and not allowed in the kitchen because they are unclean, nor to see the sun or a man because both are ‘god’.

Lately, I have been reading a lot of Italian fairy tales as a kind of inspiration and preparation for the new novel I am working on, a companion to The Innamorati.

Among the fairy tales I have been reading there appears a creature who is rarely ever seen for she is merely a place holder in the climatic tension of the story's finale: she is the bride the Prince almost marries, because he is too foolish, too enchanted, or too impatient (not waiting those seven years) and impulsively plans a wedding with the wrong woman. Of course, the heroine bride arrives in the nick of time, challenging the Prince to recall his vows of love. The Prince is chastened and then furious, turning to the almost bride (and sometimes just married bride) and denouncing her -- as if it were her fault he screwed up.

A discussion led by Ann Fessler, the film’s director, will follow the screening.
WHEN: Thursday, March 21, 2013 at 7 p.m.
DETAILS: At a time when “nice girls” didn’t get pregnant, women were expelled from high schools and colleges and forced to leave jobs as teachers and nurses before their indiscretion was apparent to others. They were rendered voiceless and invisible—banished to the towns of distant relatives or maternity homes to give birth and surrender their children.
For the past 30 years, Ann Fessler has focused on the stories of women and the impact that myths, stereotypes, and mass media images have on their lives and intimate relationships. Between 2002-2005, Fessler conducted over 100 interviews with women who lost children to adoption during the 28 years that followed World War II, when a perfect storm of circumstances led to an unprecedented number of surrenders.

Last week, the Times published another mournful article of equivalent length about the pending evictions of Palestinian residents from their rented apartments along “a narrow cobblestone alley” inside the Old City. Written by Diaa Hadid, it focused on the plight of families who claim that their pending evictions are based on “seemingly arcane violations of their rental agreements” in an attempt “to create Jewish enclaves inside the historic Muslim Quarter.” In translation, they are living in property owned by Jews who were expelled from the Old City by the Jordanian army in 1948.

Retrieved Text: Main message of this broadcast: This drama illustrates some of the issues and concerns in the complex area of land ownership rights. Even though women spend hours of every day working on the land, they are often denied access to land. Limiting women’s access to land limits their ability to produce food more abundantly, and affects the well-being of their families and their communities. Women are increasingly searching for ways to bring awareness to the issue of land ownership rights. Some women are calling for changes to the laws and customs that restrict their right to own and inherit the land they work so hard.
Suggestions: In the drama that follows, the discussion between Grace and her husband, Simon, presents possible points of view of both men and women. End your broadcast with some questions for your listeners to initiate discussion about this topic, or invite both men and women in your audience to share their opinions about land ownership rights for women with you. Follow up with a second broadcast presenting some of the shared opinions. Or perhaps you could end this broadcast with a panel discussion made up of women and men in your community.

The woman is expected to avoid snails (ikolo or ejula) so the child does not have “running eyes and nose” as well as monkey meats so the child does not “resemble a monkey.” There should be less pepper in her food and she must not be burdened with strenuous work, heavy load or walk around too much during the heat of the day.

Retrieved Text: Can a woman buy and own property?
Yes. A woman over 18 years of age has all the rights to buy property and full ownership rights on property bought by her or willed to her or gifted to her. She can sell or give it away as a gift or through a will.
These rights are not changed due to marriage.
What are the rights that daughters have over parents’ property?
Daughters have equal right of inheritance as sons to their father's property. They also have a share in the mother's property. This is true for property self-acquired by the parent. The rules, however, differ for ancestral property (inherited by the parent), based on whether the parent was alive as of September 2005 or not. For example, if the parent passed away before the Hindu Succession Act, 2005 came into effect, she cannot claim a share in ancestral property.
How about their rights over her husband’s and in-law’s property?
Marriage does not confer automatic rights to a wife over her husband’s property. She can inherit it only after his lifetime and that too only based on the will. In case of the husband’s ancestral property, there are no rights and she can only inherit it from the deceased husband.
Likewise, a daughter-in-law does not have a right over the property of her in-laws. She can only get a share after it is passed on to her husband and then from him through succession (or a will).

The cause of the fire isn't yet known but the girlfriend apparently tried to get him out of the house and couldn't do it. She had to leave him. My sympathy goes out to her and the families and friends. There are no words. Life isn't fair.
When you're younger, it seems you have the idea that if you do what everyone tells you to do, you are guaranteed certain things. You get good grades, you go to college. If you work hard, you'll be successful. At some point, you start to realize there are no guarantees. You've been so concerned with what you SHOULD do and whether you WILL do it or not that you don't realize that life is more unforeseen circumstances and heartrending surprises than ordered systems and predictable outcomes.
This is the third student I know who died suddenly. One boy was thrown out of a rolling car during summer break, and one year, a girl was a passenger in a car driven by another student on Halloween when he lost control. She also died in a fire as the driver and his girlfriend attempted to rescue her. In both accidents - drugs, alcohol, and other cars were not factors. Inexperienced drivers were.

So imagine this: A student arrives in school in the morning and answers five questions that will be calculated in a customized algorithm to figure out what she'll be doing that day. That algorithm will decide which teacher she'll work with, her level of learning based on what she learned the previous day, and her specific activities.
The system completely subverts the traditional classroom model of one teacher for 25- 30 students per classroom. And each student learns in different modalities throughout the day: individually with computer software, with groups, with a virtual tutor, with a live tutor, and so on.
"There are so many ways that kids can learn," Rush said. "It could be the best way is with a teacher, but that's not the only way. There have to be choices."
Based in three public schools in New York, the School of One system is ripe for scaling -- but only when the algorithm is as smart as it could possibly be, Rush says.
"We have to build in time to try new things," he said. "Some will work and some won’t, and that's okay."
When it comes to creating a models of schools for the future, this could very well be it. It combines much of what forward-thinking education reformers say is key: individualized learning, the best of technology, and a flexible learning system that adapts

(For example, at some schools Freshmen aren't allowed to Rush until January) Is this always based on Time spent on campus (or as a college student for a transfer) or are there situations in terms of Rush where having a year's worth of credits from AP exams makes a difference?
Assuming I'm interpreting your question correctly: As far as I understand, on campuses with deferred recruitment for freshmen, this refers only to how long you've spent on campus. If you are a first-semester freshman, you are restricted from participating in recruitment. More challenging classes do not affect this in any way.
My school just recently switched to deferred recruitment, so the "time spent on campus" definitely has been a topic of conversation, especially if any girls had transferred/will transfer. As far as my university is concerned (and I believe most with which I am familiar, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong), a PNM needs at least 12 credit hours from an accredited college or university, after high school graduation. Advanced Placement (AP) and Dual-Enrollment courses/credits are not accepted. Transfer students with at least 12 credit hours from another accredited college or university are eligible (This is taken directly from my university's website).

All that stood between Winslow students and the history of their school was a copper box recovered from the building’s cornerstone.
Ear-piercing cheers could be heard through the halls of Winslow elementary as the school’s principal, Ron Springer, gently opened the box and sorted through copies of yellowed newspapers, pictures and letters.
A weathered magazine and various squares of microfilm were also uncovered. A copy of the Feb. 3, 1960, edition of the Rush-Henrietta Herald featured a story on the opening of the Winslow school.
They also found a surprise inside — a copy of the school’s 25th yearbook, which would have been planted there in 1983. Springer was especially shocked.
“Somebody’s been messing with the box,” he said, joking.
Scott Rapp, a former student at the school, attended the opening of the time capsule. Inside was a letter from Rapp’s class — written by Rapp himself. So, Rapp read the document aloud. It told students of the “future” his class envisioned.
The students believed the future of Henrietta would include flying buses, a junior high school behind Winslow and blackboards that could erase themselves. They also predicted Henrietta would become its own city.
Rapp heard about the time capsule opening sometime in November. He called Springer and offered to assist.

Because of this, we would at times have limited class time to have lecture or cover any material that was planned for that day.

Earnest Coleman, 26, was charged with kidnapping and will be arraigned Sunday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kim Worthy said in a statement.
Coleman and other people allegedly kidnapped Deontae Mitchell at about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday outside an east side market, Worthy said. She did not provide further details, except to say that the investigation is ongoing.
Three other people have been arrested, including a 45-year-old Detroit man who is waiting to be extradited from Ohio.
Deontae's body was found Thursday on Detroit's east side, and an autopsy found no indication that he was shot. The manner and cause of death are under investigation.
Deontae disappeared Tuesday night while riding bikes with a cousin, who told police that Deontae had picked up money dropped by a man who was urinating outside a market. Surveillance video shows Deontae being pursued by a man, who grabbed the boy by his arm and forced him into a car.
The boy's mother, Crystal Mitchell, told the Detroit Free Press that Deontae and his cousin were going to the market to buy pop or juice.
A large group of young people were outside and picked up the money that dropped from the man's pocket.
The man walked into the market, but returned outside with a gun drawn after realizing his money was missing, Crystal Mitchell told the newspaper Friday.

Right after I got another office for my expanding small-press publishing empire, I was bouncing cheerily across the manicured greens of my neo-Georgian campus, twirling my impressive ring of keys. I ran into the university president, who was carrying the 50 extra pounds that came with his office and walked as if the broom of the legislature to which he answered was stuck firmly halfway up his behind. When he had been my colleague in the humanities, he had been not only lighter, but sprightlier.
"Look," I said, twirling my keys faster, "I can barely remember all the offices I have."
With a glint of malicious glee, he reached into his pocket, below the globe of his presidential belly, and extracted a single key. "I only have one," he said.
I crashed into the green. Of course. Power was reductive. He only needed one key. Someone more powerful, the governor, let's say, probably used no keys at all. Doors opened noiselessly before him. The invisible machinery of power worked quietly to keep the man's life simple. He probably used no money either. Or credit cards. A simple flourish of his pen was sufficient.
The encounter set me thinking. The amassing of wealth and privilege has no other ostensible purpose than to simplify life. While the flunkies toil, the great man lies on the beach.

Otis Gooding, 31, was standing behind the store counter and talking with co-workers when the e-cigarette exploded, burning his leg, thigh and hand, said attorney Sanford Rubenstein.
Security camera video obtained from the store shows Gooding jumping as sparks begin shooting from his pants pocket. Smoke billows from his pants as he attempts to remove the device.
Gooding suffered third-degree burns and was admitted to the Weill Cornell Medical Center burn unit, where he is expected to have surgery, Rubenstein said.
No one else was injured during the incident, though co-workers who witnessed the explosion said they were still "shaken up" by what happened.
John Lee, another employee of Central Cellars Wine and Spirits, in Grand Central Terminal, said he ran behind a pillar in the store once the sparks started flying.
